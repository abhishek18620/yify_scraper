0,16.0,4.7,"The idea of recovering from a broken relationship is one that could
make a very heavy emotional movie. The deep feelings we have for one
another when in love and the discovery that your partner no longer
shares those feelings is lot to bear. But why explore such issues when
you can just make another psycho ex movie.They must make at least one or two of these every year. However, such
films are not being made because they portray deep themes that resonate
with the audience. They're being made because they're cheap and pretty
much guarantee a return on investment for multi- million (sometimes
billion) dollar movie studios.With the exception of Rosario Dawson, who gives her role a better
performance than it deserves, no one in this movie even attempts to do
anything compelling with this material. Katherine Heigl's character
seems copied and pasted from her role in Home Sweet Hell (2015).
Although that cinematic experience was also a suckfest, at least it
tried to be something unique. In that film's world, her role as the
stuck up housewife who's willing to do anything (including murder)
worked (within the established parameters). Here, she plays the same
role but in a more grounded universe where you have to seriously wonder
who could possibly marry such an abysmal characterization of a human
being.I could criticize the movie's pacing if it had any. Each act feels
prolonged far longer than it should be with Heigl repeatedly messing
with Dawson as we wait for Dawson to figure out that her fiance's ex is
truly, unbelievably, Simon Legree evil. When we finally get to the
third act rather than following a natural progression the movie is
dragged there kicking and screaming as it allows characters to discover
things not because it makes sense but because even the filmmakers
finally recognized that this thing must end.What might be worst of all is that this movie concludes with a bit of
clear sequel baiting. At that point, all I could think was ""sure, why
not"". Let's get Unforgettable 2. Hell, let's build an Unforgettable
Cinematic Universe with spin-offs and team ups. In that way I hope that
I can leave this particular movie's universe and be sure to never come
back.In short, if you need some painful dental work done that would be a
much more entertaining expenditure of your time and money.",100,2017
1,12.833333333333334,6.6,"Maybe I had my hopes too high for this one. Like many other fans of the
original material, this adaptation has intrigued me since the first
trailers were available online, because it really looked nice visually,
but, Is this movie worth to be part of the GitS universe? - Short answer: Not really. Not even nice try. - Long answer: The cinematography its truly remarkable, it somehow
reproduce the atmosphere of the original anime, the decaying,
depressing, dark megalopolis is correctly reproduced here (despite the
giant weird advertisements that are spread around, that doesn't really
make any sense, and didn't appear in the anime, what are they trying to
sell?), the costumes, robots, and the general look and feel of the
characters are quite satisfying and solid. The music is not bad at all,
includes some of the original score and it work towards creating a
dense and dark environment. The acting is standard, not bad at all. The
script is.... ohhh boy, let me breath... to use nice words, the script
seems to be written addressed to children or to very 'slow' people. All
the rich complexity, all the mature and philosophical themes, all the
sides of the story that the original material let out to be imagined by
the viewer, all that is gone here. Here you can find a bland, generic
script, that explain a generic origin story, that never tries to get
into the philosophical or ethical implications of human body
enhancements or AI. Where the characters are one-sided, good vs bad
people. We are use to that over-simplification of a movie plot, since
we sadly live in a world conquered by the 'marvel'/'batman' method of
making a movie, where the plot should be simple and thin, the
characters shouldn't have any grays and the action should be convoluted
and confusing, full of minions to destroy for the sake of fill 100
minutes (well at least this adaptation has correct action scenes, that
are easy to follow and most of the time are not annoying). To wrap up,
a correct movie, that shines in the visual and action sides, but has a
forgettable script and characters. It will probably perform good in the
box office, and that worries me because what could come next, it will
be really sad to see how they reduce Akira, Jin-roh, Evangelion or
Cowboy bebbop to a generic action blockbuster without any of the things
that made those stories great.",107,2017
2,8.0,7.7,"I knew nothing about this film. Had seen no adds, heard no word of
mouth, pretty much nothing. I only found it only after tapping out the local AMC 24 and driving a
few extra miles to see something new.The premise was intriguing: What to do with a seven year old
mathematical prodigy caught between a cozy, loving household occupied
by her doting Uncle Frank and a one-eyed cat named Fred, and a
challenging but cold academic world ready to pace her on mental
treadmills for the rest of her life.McKenna Grace plays little Mary who's character is at the center of
attention whether she likes it or not. Mostly not.Grace's performance does raise a few eye brows as she very convincingly
plays a precocious and genius little girl plagued with boredom being
surrounded by the dead-weight of average students she has nothing in
common with.In fact, Mary's personality is also far developed beyond her peers,
exhibiting a sarcastic and jaded sense of humor more on par with a
bunch of 40-year olds downing a shot or two after a particularly bad
day at work.After Mary's abilities are discovered by her first grade teacher, the
inevitable battle for command of her future quickly unfolds.One very powerful supporting role is supplied by Lindsay Duncan who
portrays Evelyn the Grandmother. Evelyn is a poised and proper
Englishwoman armed with a titanium intellect few would want to
challenge. As the legal proceedings unfold, Evelyn verbally fire-bombs
the entire court room from the stand without batting an eye in her
fight for custody of Mary.Her arguments and assessments are hopelessly air-tight and seamless,
leaving Uncle Frank and his lawyer scrambling.Frank just wants Mary to be a little girl. Grandma wants to plug her
into The Matrix. Who will win? 'Gifted' is not without it's displays of some original laughs. My
favorite was a scene in which little Mary discovers her Uncle Frank is
sleeping with her 1st grade teacher, who one morning comes stumbling
into the kitchen wearing only a towel.Their reaction to each other is priceless.As to why this production is flying under the radar with virtually no
advertising or promotion is baffling.The hour-and-a-half flew by for me and left me with an odd feeling it
ended too soon. Aside from that, there was almost nothing wrong with
this film, at least not that I could find.Warm, unique and entertaining, 'Gifted' should stay with you for days
afterwards.A great family night movie.",101,2017
3,6.75,6.4,"I really enjoyed this film. It was imaginative, fun and just thoroughly
entertaining throughout the whole time I was watching it. It had some
actually genuine heartwarming moments that didn't feel manufactured
like some other animated films I've seen in recent past. The animation
was also just gorgeous. I really loved the look of the film, I thought
it had a really nice aesthetic style and felt like a classic piece of
animation that if CGI was around in the seventies, it would've looked
like this. All in all, I personally loved this film. If you want
something that's just plain fun, bizarre and imaginative- with a touch
of warmth- I'd say check this flick out. But if you're looking for
something with more of a concrete plot and a straight forward
narrative, you probably won't find that here.",97,2017

them.A taxi with two children is destroyed. Later one of the contracted
soldiers is killed and his friend tries to find out what happened. Who
are the bad guys here? That warhead in the barrack or somebody or
somebodies much higher in the hierarchy? This is not a typical Ken
Loach drama, since it's on the surface more of a typical war thriller
than an outcry about social injustice. But social injustice becomes the
main theme. Loach is one of the few remaining outraged society

may be a bit off, but it's fiction, let it be fun. And for god's sake,
lay off the special effects.What you end up with is a fantastic film about the possibilities and
dangers of technology in a hypothetical world. You see the hopes and

militaristic government. You get to see a great example of ""power
corrupting"" a human being.I've seen this film a lot, from 15 to 25 years old, and the last scene

6,18.333333333333332,4.5,"Eloise is a movie based on a real world location in Michigan, more
specifically a closed sanitarium that was renowned for it's terrible
medical practices. The movie centers around a son who discovers he has the opportunity to
inherent his Father's estate, which comes along with a hefty amount of
money.But there's a catch, he needs to get his Mother's death certificate.
Everything seems easy enough until he discovers that his Mother's death
certificate was actually moved to a different location and in order to
get it, he would need to file go through a lengthy (and expensive)
legal process. So instead of going through the legal system and getting the paper work
how he should (legally), he decides to break into the now defunct
sanitarium with a friend. I am not a lawyer, but the entire concept that the movie is focused on
seems kind of sketchy, you'd think all of this would have been handled
already. And why would their son need to go to court to get a copy of
his Mother's death certificate? Besides being riddled full of weird plot holes, at first glance the
movie appears to be your generic haunted sanitarium , but it starts to
get really goofy as the film goes on. Frankly, I feel the movie would
have been much better if it had went for the generic spooky ghost film
instead of what they went with.The acting and cinematography are fine for what it is; I have no
complaints. The writing is pretty shaky and the plot of the movie
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. To be honest, I wouldn't even rent this from a RedBox. If it came on
NetFlix or Hulu or something and you got some time to burn (the movie
isn't even 2 hours), then go for it, but I can't recommend spending
actual money to see this film.",89,2017
7,16.6,8.9,"We all know that the ""Phantom of the Opera"" is by far one of the best
known and best loved musicals of the past years. It is quite amazing to
learn that this year is already the 25th year of this acclaimed piece
of musical theater based on the novel by Gaston Leroux. The beautiful
music was by Andrew Lloyd Webber, with most of the lyrics by Charles
Hart, and produced by Cameron Macintosh. It debuted in the West End in
London in 1986. Phantom is recognized as the highest-grossing
entertainment event of all time and the most financially successful
theatrical show in history.Last week, it was suddenly announced that the special 25th Anniversary
performance held at the Royal Albert Hall last October 2-3, 2011 was
actually going to be shown in local theaters! I knew that my wife and I
had to see it again. This morning, I was surprised to learn that this
will be a 3 hour and 41 minute movie. This caused problems in our
schedule but we still decided to push through and watch. An opportunity
to watch a theater event such as this on the big screen was indeed
rare.As we entered, we found out the reason for the very long running time.
Before the show proper, there was first a short documentary about
Phantom by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber. Here we got to hear how the idea of
doing Phantom came about, and meet the original London production crew.
This lasted about 15 minutes. After which there were ads announcing the
sale of DVDs of this event come March next year. I guess we still have
to wait that long to get an original copy of this special. Then there
was about another 5 minute pause (as if waiting for the audience to
fill up) before the show itself actually began. I see that this film
was going to approximate a real theater presentation. Unfortunately,
this also included a real 20 minute Intermission after Act 1. The
theater (we watched in SM Megamall) actually paused the movie for the
whole 20 minutes! So be warned. The Phantom was played by Ramin Karimloo, while his ingénue Christine
Daae was played by Sierra Boggess. I knew these were the same actors
who played these same characters in the short-lived sequel of Phantom
called ""Love Never Dies."" Ms. Boggess was beautiful as Christine
channeling both innocence and sensuousness. Her soprano was flawless
even in the most challenging and punishing notes in ""Think of Me,""
""Phantom of the Opera,"" and ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again."" As
the Phantom, Mr. Karimloo has got that X-factor that makes the role
dangerous yet riveting and sympathetic. His voice can navigate the
highs and lows that makes Mr. Lloyd Webber a musical sadist. It can be
strong, yet tender and also menacing. His ""Music of the Night"" and
""Point of No Return"" were fantastic!The supporting performances were also very strong. Hadley Fraser cuts a
dashing figure as Raoul. His featured duet with Christine, ""All I Ask
of You,"" was very well sung. Kiera Duffy makes a hilarious Madame
Carlotta even as she also hit those unbelievable high notes, in songs
like ""Primadonna."" Liz Robertson makes a very imposing Madame Giry with
her severe black gown always in sharp contrast with the very bright
colors of the costumes around her. Everything was so expertly staged:
the dancing, the costumes, the set pieces, the make-up, the video
backgrounds, were all so rich, elaborate and detailed. The camera work
and direction was also very effective in conveying the drama, danger
and romance of the story.After the last scene where Meg Giry holds up the Phantom's mask after
he vanishes, there was a very long curtain call. The whole stage was
filled with actors and dancers. It was a very emotional moment.
However, after the three main characters made their bows, it was not
yet over. Sir Andrew himself took center stage and thanked the audience
and his crew, present and past. Then he introduced the man who played
the first Phantom, Michael Crawford! Finally he brought out his ""Angel
of Music"", Ms. Sarah Brightman (who was looking very hefty indeed
nowadays). The surprise did not end there, Ms. Brightman obliged to sing! Of
course, she sang ""Phantom of the Opera."" I would not say it was her
best because her breathing was audible, but she could still hit those
killer notes at the end. Another surprise was when it was the Phantom's
turn to sing, four actors who played the Phantom before came out on
stage to sing with Ms. Brightman. Of the four, I recognized two: Colm
Wilkinson (Jean Valjean from Les Miz) and the fantastic Anthony Warlow!
The other guy was John Owen Jones (the current Phantom in London). The
youngest guy of the four Phantoms, Peter Joback (upcoming Phantom in
the 2012 run in London), had a rather thin and nasal pop voice, in
sharp contrast with the booming tenors of the other three. Too bad,
Michael Crawford did not sing a note. After this, the four ex-Phantoms
all took turns to sing ""Music of the Night."" This was another beautiful
rendition of the song. At the end, the present Phantom, Ramin Kaminloo
also joined the group. Another curtain call followed, and the event
comes to an end.This is definitely a must-watch for fans of Phantom, as well as fans of
Musical Theater in general. When time comes for the DVD to come out,
that should also be a must-own in his DVD collection.",137,2011
8,9.0,5.1,"So the new thing for seasoned horror directors is to make their first
non horror film, sometimes with elements of horror, but ultimately a
different genre. Ti west with ""In a valley of violence, Christopher
Smith with ""Detour"", now Eric England with ""Get the girl"", and there
are many more examples I cant think of off the top of my head
immedietely. Eric England's ""Get the girl"" is upbeat, hip, somewhat
exciting, and pretty fast paced. This movie is done by a director who
has only done horror films up to this point and although he is young
Eric England is still seasoned in the genre. Madison County had corny
and ugly characters but was overall a good horror movie. Contracted was
also a good horror movie. It is a body horror film with some good
creepy factors to it. It gives a nice nod to independent horror as it
stars talented screenwriter Simon Barret as the mysterious man,
Caroline Williams as the worried mother, Matt Mercer who England also
used in his first film ""Madison County"" and went on to become a staple
in independent horror. ""Roadside"", England's second to newest film, was
pretty crappy and uneventful. It was a mix of a very boring
thriller/mystery/horror. Now, England comes out with this narrative
engaging thriller, ""Get the girl"". The only problem is tho, that there
are a lot of problems with this film, as it seems as if the director
wanted to upgrade his filming quality and style but he kinda just did
it with out really doing his homework on it. It seems like an amateur
director tried to make a big budget feeling film, but failed kinda
miserably. The lead character is boring and extremely generic. He is
not attractive, he is childish, his intro background story was
seriously lacking any real background info about him which keeps the
audience from ever really feeling for this guy or relating with him and
immedietely makes us think he is shady by not telling us more of his
background. Its like he was hiding something from us and we knew this
within the first 5 or 10 minutes of the movie. The girl is also very
boring and not very attractive at all. The movie is overall confusing
and the only redeeming quality, in my opinion, is the presence of Noah
Segan. He brings a certain menace to any movie he stars in. This movie
seemed childish and immature. It is like a step backwards for Eric
England, as there is no real emotional or mental pull to this film. It
is barely comendable and very forgettable. The biggest problem in this
film is the editing. The film editing sucks. There are several shots
where a character is standing there making a certain face, or even
pointing a gun at someone, and then in the immediate next shot, the
character is suddenly turned around looking out the window. There was
no transfer in actions. It was weird to see the focus of the shot
operating and moving smoothly and accurately, while the background
character was pointing a gun and shifted to walking up the stairs in
the blink of an eye. Terrible editing for an overused and tiring plot.
You would think Eric England had more ""oomph"" in him. I am not
impressed at all. I follow horror directors and their work and I was
excited to hear about this film but once I saw it, I felt embarrassed
for the director. Maybe he will redeem himself with his upcoming four
films lol. I guess the lesson here is don't bite off more than you can
chew and always do your homework. Gave it a 5 cuz its a good teeny
bopper movie for toolish and foolish kids, and cuz i feel a little bad
for England who made a movie to throw up to for all the wrong reasons.",87,2017

languidness of the moment that comes in is to establish the
undercurrent of the raw palpable emotions.Will come to the portrayals later - first lets get to the technical
aspects of the film. The screenplay is tightly wound like the straps of
the wheelchair and it lets go off the thread at the perfect moment and
doesn't falter or is never loose preventing the viewer to fall. The
camera is from our view point. The background music is the pounding of
our heart and we are entrenched in completely. The songs are the soul
of the film. The editing is as sharp as that of sushi maestro's knife
and why wouldn't it be when the story is the maestro's himself. Who
better to know how to tighten the strings.Now to the portrayals. What can one say of the ever evolving AB. He has
not only reinvented himself but has proved Darwin's law. Every film he
showcases a new facet. He is truly the pawn of the chessboard who with
every step he is taking in the board of acting has retaken his position
as king again and again. FA has the right amount of restraint and is a
delight to see and cherish.Yes I did get the plot midway of the film but the checkmate that I was

checkmate. Truly I have lost on the twist but I am glad that I won

11,10.5,5.9,"Beautifully shot film, with intriguing intertwined love stories. Well
balanced between the protagonists narratives and the inevitable lead-in
to the Armenian Genocide, showing its impact on a very human level,
particularly on the story's leads.Those who provide a 1 star of 10 clearly are not actually rating the
film, but providing political feedback. How many who have rated it as 1
in 10 have actually seen the film? Doubt many have. Some of the rants
are a clear attempt at revisionist history to try to rationalize the
actions of the Ottomans. Sad part is that there really should be no
need for those rating that way to do so, since Turkey (which I know is
a denier) is not the same as the Ottoman Empire, and modern Turkey
(though less modern under Erdogan), and Turks, should feel no
compulsion to try to defend that Empire.Please use IMDb for the purposes for which it is meant, not to attack
for political purposes. It would be fair, for example, only once one
sees a film, to criticize it for being too political (though politics
are worthy of expression in film), or too one-sided, and explain why,

a party of adventurers going on a quest, and there aren't many movies
made like that.The novelty of it aside, it never gets boring due to its plot twists
and realistic looking action.There is an epic historic novel called ""Raptor"" which has a similar
story, at least the first few pages of it. When ""Pilgrimage"" ends you

abandoned warehouse to make a deal to buy some machine guns. Everything
is supposed to go smoothly until one member from the one group draws
out a gun and shoots the other because of a previous incident. And all
hell breaks.Ben Wheatley's previous film, High Rise, I was not a fan of. High Rise
felt too disturbing with heavy-handed messaging while lacking a
coherent plot. Free Fire is by far a major improvement with hilarious
dialogue, fun and well-written characters and non-stop action. I saw
the movie at TIFF today and was pleasantly surprised. Wheatley turns
this empty warehouse into a war zone with each of these character
taking cover behind various objects and firing blindly. Unlike a lot of
generic action movies where characters seem to magically dodge bullets,
no one is safe and everyone eventually gets scraped or hit by bullets.
This leads to some fun sequences of characters crawling on the ground
to get from one cover to the next.Surprisingly the two standouts are Cillian Murphy and Armie Hammer.
Both were surprisingly funny in subtle ways. Sharlto Copley once again
plays another weird but yet still hilarious and fun character. I also
give strong shout-outs to Sam Riley and Jack Reynor. And Brie Larson is
bad-ass as she holds her own weight against her male co- stars.If I can say one negative it's that this isn't a movie with a lot of
depth. It's not flat but don't expect this to be too much of a complex
film. It is just simply about the these 2 trigger-happy groups trying
either to kill or survive. It is more of a black comedy/thriller.Free Fire is definitely one of the most fun and exciting action movies
you will see so it is definitely worth a shot to watch once it releases
in theatres.",90,2016
14,16.333333333333332,5.9,"Greetings again from the darkness. A film festival wouldn't be complete
without at least one mind-blowing avant-garde cinematic experience. I'm
not the kind that needs every ending neatly bow-wrapped, and I often
enjoy having conventional story structure challenged and even
dissolved. Writer/director Sarah Adina Smith seems to thrive in such an
environment in this twisty psychological thriller covering three
timelines (one of which may be a dream)  or a split personality  or
two/three men from one  or some combination  or something else
entirely that I might have missed. (I'm not too proud to admit this
distinct possibility).When a filmmaker bravely dives into the bizarre, casting becomes
crucial. Ms. Smith nails it with Rami Malek, DJ Qualls and Kate Lyn
Sheil. Thanks to the popularity of TV's ""Mr. Robot"", Malek is now a
leading man  albeit far outside the Ryan Gosling mold. Here he plays
Jonah, a struggling family man with a wife (Ms. Sheil) and young child.
Working as a night Concierge at a hotel, Jonah tries to make the best
of the lack of sleep and minimal contact with his family. In addition
to Jonah, Malek plays Buster, a slippery and hirsute mountain man who
negotiates his way through the Montana mountains by hanging out in the
multi-million dollar vacation homes (mostly) vacated by their owners
during the snowy winter months.The film bounces between 3 periods for Jonah/Buster: the elusive
near-mythical mountain man running from the law, the bleak nights of
the family man, and a dream-like sequence where he is adrift at sea in
a row boat. Throughout the film, references to ""sphincter"" and multiple
proclamations that ""The Inversion is coming"" lead us to believe there
could be a sci-fi connection or an apocalyptic ending headed our way.
Instead, it's ""the belly of the whale"" that might unlock the mystery or
mysteries serenaded by the thunderous techno-bass bass. Even with the
dark comedic elements, it's a head-scratcher for sure; but one that
manages to keep us engaged despite our whirlwind of theories and
uncertainly.",96,2016

mannerisms and psychotic gases are him to a T. I met the fella and the
acting here might seem over the top but that is what he was like. Over
the top. The rest of the cast is great too. The direction is spot on as
well. Real menace to the piece. This is the British version of Chopper
princess n my opinion. Like it or loath it. The real problem is the
story just isn't very good. Nothing here about Lenny debut Collecting,
running the doors in clubs in London, his criminal associations or any
number of other much more interesting takes. No, this film is about
three fights he had with Roy Shaw and how he treated a few people. I've
no doubt the man (is specially in his younger days) was a psychopathic
asshole. There's the usual explanation of an abusive adult, but really?
No I don't think this explains or drive L Mc. So n conclusion a fine

detective(a very shitty one) solving crime around Venice until his dog
get kidnap by a local drug dealer played by Jason Momoa(Yeah Aquaman
himself).The movie does have some good sense of humor but sometime it
feel force as hell.For the action part it not that much only near the

engaging with her clients on a night by night basis as if she was
working a ""normal job"" or something. The filmmakers do a good job of
expressing her subtle contempt for the old, fat and ugly businessmen
she sleeps with for money. The film also goes through how she balances
this profession without her friends, family, and other relationships
discovering the truth.But I guess that's not enough of a story for a movie, so they added a
part about her relationship with a new potential boyfriend, who is more
than he seems. It's not a bad add to the story, but for me it does
cheapen what it seems they had been trying to do for most of the
picture, or what I thought they were doing in humanizing a prostitute's
life.But overall Sex Doll is a good movie that tries not to romanticize or
demoralize the decision this young woman made, only humanize the young

make this my new favourite movie, unfortunately the script and
narrative (if they originally  had one at all) failed to deliver.My main problem was the narrative. The story takes place over a few
decades and follows the efforts of Fawcett to discover the ""Lost City
of Z"". He embarks on 3 ""perilous"" expeditions going up the Amazon but
no sense of danger or suffering is at any point conveyed by the
narrative. The 3 trips are each expedited under 20 minutes of screen time. We
have absolutely no idea of the time involved (apparently the
expeditions lasted a few years each) nor any feeling towards the
hardships the crew faces. To make matters worse, new crew members keep
appearing out of nowhere and at some point even a horse!! which was
nowhere to be seen on the raft in previous scenes. If this was not
enough.... the raft keeps going downstream when they are supposed to go
UPSTREAM, towards the source of the river.... oh well, I could have
lived with these inconsistencies if I had a character to root for.
Unfortunately we never feel any sympathy towards any of the
protagonists. The character development is non existent and not helped
by the fact the acting is very stiff at the best of time and downright
awful for most of the movie. I didn't find Charlie Hunnam convincing as
a Hell's Angel in SOA but he is seriously laughable as an English Army
officer. This absence of feeling and empathy is also to be experienced
towards the wife and children he leaves behind, every time he embarks
on one of those trips. We simply do not care for them.I obviously did not go into it expecting a new Fitzcarraldo or
Apocalypse Now but for a movie which should have dealt with a man's
obsessive doomed quest for a Lost City, the jungle and/or the river
should have been part and parcel of the movie, a character in itself,
an omnipresent entity. No such thing. The whole movie could have been
shot in a winter garden for all I saw... You never have the feeling you
are in the mud with the protagonists. The only feeling you experience
is one of utter detachment and an urge for the movie to finish as soon
as possible. Extremely disappointed. Do not believe the hype!",141,2016

25,14.0,4.5,"I would probably not have bothered with this film, but a good friend
REALLY wanted to see it, so we went and checked it out. At this point
in modern film-making, there is nothing new under the sun...especially
in the ""Horror genre""...sadly that is also true of this title. The plot
has been done before in 2009's ""The Unborn"" more or less, but this run
through has 2 twin sisters, rather than a boy and a girl.The beginning is OK, there does seem to be a supernatural basis to the
origin of the individual who gets the ball rolling in the first 5 mins
(pun intended), but this element is never really pursued again; if at
all...then only in the final 20 minutes, but it is never specifically
mentioned as such...merely by assumption.There are your compulsory characters that serve no purpose other than
to die! Obligatory annoying individuals who you wish would die (some do
thankfully), littered throughout, along with the typical in the social
media/see short attention span modern age; jump cuts that make up for
not having sensible transition scenes between main scenes. To be fair
the editing is probably the best part of this film, so they at least
did a competent job of splicing all the celluloid together (if they
even still do that?).The acting is passable in the main. The 2 female leads do OK, but their
friendship being not quite sisters/not quite lovers/who knows what,
really fails to convince and you can almost see them switching out of
character before the director yells ""CUT!"" in a handful of scenes. I
had to laugh where she ties herself up thinking it will stop her
nocturnal antics; as if she tied herself up...by definition she can
untie herself!...Anyway if she was serious in any way about protecting
those around her, she would have asked to be committed/observed...I
mean seriously; the operation was in a couple of days for Christ sake!
The ending is totally predictable, by 25 minutes in you know the next
hour is a formality. There is no 1 memorable scene unless you like
freakish transformation effects (barely there tbh), and I cannot think
why anyone would want to see this more than once...so buying on DVD is
a non-starter.With so many other horror titles available, including a back catalogue
of quality films from 60s/70s/80s, it is hard to recommend this film
for any particular reason. If you're watching cable TV late and are too
lazy to reach for the remote...check it out...Maybe!",89,2016

32,12.25,7.4,"Edward G. Robinson played many ethnic types in his career, including
sinister Chinese types in THE HATCHET MAN and Greek seamen in TIGER
SHARK. But he played many Italian - Americans, mostly involved in
criminal activities. Best known is his Rico Bandello in LITTLE CAESAR,
but he also did Remy Marko in A SLIGHT CASE OF MURDER. And there is the
more respectable, but still illegal gentleman in this film, Gino
Monetti. Living in the middle of Little Italy in a mansion, Monetti
started out as a barber, living in a single room with his wife Theresa
(Esther Minciotti), and his four sons. They grow up to be Joe (Luther
Adler), Max (Richard Conte), Tony (Efrem Zimberlist Jr.), and Pietro
(Paul Valentine).Monetti's views of his Italian heritage and his adopted land's culture
are mixed. He loves the music of his homeland - he's frequently playing
opera (Rossini's THE BARBER OF SEVILLE sung by Lawrence Tibbett is
heard at one point on his record player). He does have a sense of
tradition: every Wednesday Theresa cooks a big dinner for the family,
and everyone has to come (including Max's fiancé Maria Domenico - Debra
Paget - and her mother Helena Domenico - Hope Emerson - and Joe's wife
Elena - Diana Douglas). Gino will talk about how different life in
America is, where a man does not have to forever be in the same job as
his father, or where cities grow upward due to skyscrapers. But he
treats three of his sons as servants. Joe, who is his oldest, is asked
to scrub Gino's back in the bathtub, or has to chauffeur his father
around, and is only a clerk in the bank (although called first Vice
President). Pietro is referred to as ""dumb-head"" because he likes to
work on a boxing career rather than an office job. Tony is a lady's
man, always quiet and well dressed, and dismissed by his father as a
weakling. Only Max has gained the old man's respect - he became an
attorney (and a pretty good one).The bank itself is a mixed concern. When Frank Puglia asks for a
$150.00 loan to buy a horse, he only gets $120.00 as $30.00 is taken
off the top as interest on the new loan (later the loan has escalated
to being $280.00). A poor woman needing money, however, gets the money
without any interest being given. It later develops that Gino is lousy
with bookkeeping, and resents government interest in his bank, but he
is an intelligent banker, on the whole a decent guy, but he
occasionally turns into a usurer.Max, although engaged to Maria, meets a socialite named Irene Bennett
(Susan Hayward), who initially hires him to help an ex-boyfriend who
robbed her. They gradually get into an affair, which threatens the
engagement to Maria. Hayward's jealousy eventually leads to a break in
it. At just that time, government actions close the bank and lead to a
trial for Gino on serious fraud charges. Max tries to defend him, but
he finds Gino too hot-tempered on the witness stand. He talks about the
case with Joe (who is not too interested in whether the old man goes to
jail or not), and says that possibly if they bribe a juror they can
save Gino. Joe refuses to help. Max tries to bribe the juror, but finds
himself arrested instead. It results in his disbarment and seven years
in prison. Gino is not sent to prison, but finds the bank reorganized
by Joe, Tony, and Pietro, and he is put out to pasture. Still Gino
encourages hatred in Max to his brothers, pointing out that Joe
probably tipped off the police about the bribery attempt.So Max leaves prison to confront his three siblings, and to see if he
can resume life with Irene. And Joe, Tony (who has married Maria), and
Pietro wonder if Max is going to be a troublemaker.The film captured an aspect of life on the lower East side rarely shown
in films - how did banks work in those immigrant enclaves? This was
before major banks had branches around the cities, and small local
banks (like Monetti's) were common. And were run in the same haphazard
manner until the Depression made the government take a closer look. The
film, directed by Joseph Mankiewicz, crackles with good dialog (and
steamy lines too - particularly between Conte and Hayward). Robinson's
Gino is memorable - not a really bad man, but one who forgot certain
simple family rules regarding his sons. Even minor characters have good
moments: Hope Emerson's fury at Conte's flaunting his affair with
Hayward leads to a confrontation scene, and the dinner at the Monetti's
reveals how Diana Douglas (Kirk's wife) is a non-Italian mainliner that
Luther Adler married, who barely likes her in-laws (she can't stand
spaghetti dinners, and wants him to have a promised raise so she can
entertain HER friends). It is a rewarding movie about social mobility
and it's pitfalls in the urban immigrant circles.",101,1949
33,14.0,7.0,"A fascinating, frustrating, though ultimately deeply satisfying film.
Many readers have commented on the frustrations, and they are hard to
deny. My experience of this movie goes back to the early 70s, when I
first encountered it in ideal circumstances, at the Museum of Modern
Art during its complete Preminger retrospective, and in a gorgeous,
perfect print. A great introduction to a film whose very meaning
resides in its glossy surface. The first few minutes of the film
powerfully set up the tragedy that is to come: Saul Bass's dripping
teardrop titles underscored with Auric's deeply tragic music, followed
by the first black and white scenes depicting Cecile's current active
but deeply disengaged life. Then, as Cecile arrives home and begins
remembering ""last summer"", the blue Mediterranean sea begins to invade
the frame, little by little -- a striking effect, to say the least --,
we are there, in the midst of a carefree vacation with Cecile, Raymond
and Elsa, and quite successfully invited to forget the tragedy that
seems to be in the making and enter a carefree, sunlit world where
nothing, seemingly, could ever go wrong. Masterful film-making, and,
thus far, perfectly pitched: Seberg's perfectly expressionless and
beautiful face has no small part in making it work. That she is less
secure in the flashback scenes is unfortunate, but her physical
presence at least gives the right signs: this is a very young girl,
happy but extremely shallow. (Yes, I will admit that the line readings
are quite stiff -- no question she is ""acting."" But, if one is already
in the proper frame of mind they are not all that damaging.) What's
important is the holiday mood, and the performances of Niven and Mylene
Demongeot are sufficiently effervescent to evoke it. (Demongeot is a
real charmer -- beautiful beyond belief and full of joie de vivre.) The
arrival of Deborah Kerr on the scene changes all this: a dignified Lady
coming into the midst of a world she finds immoral, distasteful and, in
the deepest sense, unacceptable: her reaction to realizing that Raymond
is, shall we say, shacking up with Elsa is the turning point of the
film, the crossroads of comedy and tragedy. And from this point we are
invited to see how, step by step, comedy turns to tragedy. What's most
wonderful about this film is how diverting that progression is. The
world of the French Riviera is, after all, a world of carefree bliss
(at least on the surface), and we are given ample opportunity to enjoy
that along with the characters in the film: a delightful casino scene
(enlivened by the presence of that wonderful actor, Walter Chiari, a
truly handsome man with a wonderful flair for comedy, and here, playing
opposite Demongeot, particularly delightful) and a visually stunning
dance at the dock, a masterpiece of costume design in delicious color
and Cinemascope, worthy of a Minnelli musical (and, in its delirious
scale, surpassing most of them). Finally, let me just say that the
final moments of the film (and I will refrain from spoiling them) are
among the most moving in all cinema: an evocation of self-loathing and
emptiness that remains unrivaled in its beauty. Yes, beauty. Caveat
emptor: It is useless to see this film in the pan&scan version (I have
had the experience, and it is horrible). The Columbia DVD edition looks
great (absolutely NO extras, by the way; it appears to have been simply
dumped on the market -- odd treatment of a masterpiece). Oh, yes, my
title heading: Preminger's previous films had mostly dealt with
""little"" events -- noirs, small comedies, etc.; most of his subsequent
films (""Exodus,"" ""The Cardinal,"" ""Advise and Consent,"" ""In Harms Way"")
with Big Events. This one is still on an intimate scale, but has much
in common visually (particularly the masterful use of CinemaScope, to
which Preminger took like a fish to water) with the later films.",0,1958
34,17.25,7.0,"This is one of my favorite ""gothic"" romance movies of the 40s. There is
a haunting melody throughout and it captures the tragedy and mystery
that is Dragonwyck. Gene Tierney is wonderful in the starring role of
Miranda, going from love-struck and strong-willed to heart-broken and
resigned throughout the course of the movie, playing each scene to
perfection.A side note to Ms. Tierney's portrayal of Miranda in this film - The
actress Gene Tierney had a fling with the young John Fitzgerald
Kennedy, and first laid eyes on him, watching her, while she is playing
a scene with her father, the great actor John Huston, reading the bible
to her to determine her course of future action - should she accept the
proposal of her cousin, or not. She looked up and there he was, clearly
smitten with the beautiful Ms. Tierney, and they began to see each
other directly after that - or so Ms. Tierney comments in her marvelous
autobiography.The bible figures prominently in another scene when the imperious
Nicholas first makes his appearance, played to haughty perfection by
the very tall and very talented Vincent Price. Very dramatic and
memorable! The great Jessica Tandy also has a significant role as
Miranda's feisty maid. And, what better actress to play the role of the
wise and comforting mother, but the marvelous Anne Revere.See it, if only for the atmospheric and haunting music that stays with
you after the film is ended. See it, if only for the beautiful and
talented Gene Tierney. See it, if only for the great actors, Vincent
Price, John Huston, Anne Revere and Jessica Tandy. It is a little gem
of a film!",103,1946
35,5.6,7.0,"I've often wondered at times from a literary as well as religious point
of view what happens to some of the peripheral cast of characters in
the Scripture. I'm sure that's a question that more than a few have
pondered on, whether they are believers or not.Case in point is Barabbas. All we know about him is that he was the guy
that the mob shouted for when offered a choice between pardoning him or
Jesus of Nazareth. Some tradition has him as a common bandit, others
have him as a rebel against Rome. As played by Anthony Quinn, Barabbas is a troubled soul. As the message
of Jesus of Nazareth spreads, Barabbas is unsure of what his role is.
He's realized he's been a participant in something historic to say the
least. But people treat him differently. The early Christians view him
with some resentment. To Pontius Pilate, played by Arthur Kennedy,
Barabbas is still a no good bandit. Of course Barabbas gets himself
arrested again and begins his odyssey.The movie is an adaption of a novel by Swedish Pulitzer Prize Winning
writer Par Lagerkvist and a Swedish film adaption had already been
filmed prior to this international cast epic. Might be interesting to
view it side by side with this one. I'm sure the Swedish film didn't
have half the budget this one did.The movie fuzzes certain issues as films of this type generally do.
Pacifism is a tenet of the early Christian faith of those hiding in the
catacombs. Turning the other cheek is a big thing. But Anthony Quinn
isn't a Christian so his modus operandi isn't exactly turning the other
cheek.Some top flight professionals are in this cast. The aforementioned
Arthur Kennedy as Pilate, Silvana Mangano as Barabbas's girl friend who
becomes an early convert, Vittorio Gassman as Sahek who is Barabbas's
martyred Christian friend and most of all Jack Palance in a scene
stealing performance as the top gladiator in Rome. You should watch
this film for him alone.The message the film tries to convey is that Barabbas in and of himself
wasn't important. Jesus's life and death were pre-ordained and it could
have been Barabbas or any of hundreds of others who could have been
where he was. But the way certain folks enter into biblical stories does give writers
a whole lot of license to construct wholly fictional lives around them.
This is as good a film as any for that purpose.",137,1961
36,8.333333333333334,7.4,"Story The story quite honestly feels like you have seen it before from
Ghost in the Shell, not deviating from the ghost hacking concept that
is present all throughout the franchise. However, despite staying in
the ""comfort zone"" of the franchise it is still a fascinating universe
being portrayed, and so it is still intriguing to follow Section 9 as
they unravel a case even if the story concept isn't as unique as it
once was when it was in the franchise. This particular movie felt as
though it could fit right in with the Stand Alone Complex series as an
episode that was stand alone from the over arching story. It is nothing
new, but that isn't a bad thing because it can still tell an
interesting and rewarding story which it does.Art Production IG did a great job with the art in this series of movies
combining vibrant colors and fluid animation that give this OVA series
a unique and refreshing feel. It does a good job at making the world
feel realistic, like the movements of the characters actually have
weight and substance. I believe the cinematography could have been
better when the show slows down to scenes of conversation between
characters. Perhaps it was just the camera positioning in some of the
shots, but they could have definitely made the more dialogue heavy and
static scenes more interesting.Sound The soundtrack is nothing to go crazy about, though it does fit
the aesthetic of the Arise series quite well I believe. I can
personally admire some of the music from a technical standing because I
produce electronic music myself, but there aren't many memorable
compositions in the soundtrack. The exception to this would be the
opening theme which is an extremely soothing track with all kinds of
interesting techniques and musical elements that feels like a breath of
fresh air. Otherwise there are mainly standard songs that get the job
done, but could be done better.Characters These are the same characters of Section 9 that we have
grown to enjoy from Ghost in the Shell and it comes as no surprise that
the communication between them is entertaining, mainly Togusa, Batou,
and the Major. The other characters don't get too much spotlight in
this series which is a shame because we already know so much about
these main characters that it would be nice to get some more
development from the other characters in Section 9. That is more of a
personal gripe that stems from how fond I am of the characters. There
isn't much development of the characters in this series, it almost just
seems shoved off for the last few minutes of each movie. Without any
prior knowledge of the characters through previous iterations I would
definitely have felt detached from the characters because of this lack
of development.Ghost in the Shell: Arise as a whole does not stand as tall as other
Ghost in the Shells have but it stands with them at a comfortable
level. It doesn't attempt anything new but it still has interesting
cases for Section 9 to solve and I was on board for each one. It is a
relaxing watch that won't make you think too hard but still keeps
things seemingly complex with stories about ghost hacking and ghost
dubbing. I enjoyed it, though I still much prefer the original movie
and Stand Alone Complex over it.",59,2014

42,8.5,6.8,"I want to start off by saying that I am not going to sit here and
pretend to be above wanting to see a 100-foot tall ape shred through
some giant lizards and whatnot for around 2 hours.If you were worried that Kong would wait 40 minutes to show the action
only to cut-away when the fan makes contact with the feces, then you
can put those worries to rest because this giant hairy grump is in your
face right off the bat.I could immediately tell that this film wasn't about to shy away from
what we all craved so dearly in 2014's Godzilla, because from the first
gunshot onward this script hauls some serious behind straight toward
that colorful Skull Island which we were all so eager to see from the
trailers.Now, I have learned from a number of painful years that discipline is a
key ingredient both behind the camera and beneath the projector. I like
to think that my expectations were fair. I did not look at any reviews
at any point before I hit that seat on that Thursday night - popcorn
and drink in hand. I was ready, man.If I told you that the neat visuals surrounding the lineup of
lovecraftian nasties rendered into digital existence to confront the
titular ape was enough to save this picture, then I would be lying
straight to your face.Yes, of course we get to see a glorious pair of giant angry ape fists
make heavy and satisfying contact with: Some helicopters, a couple of
lizards without legs (which is funny, because the T-Rexes in Peter
Jackson's King Kong lacked arms), a giant squid because, you know, we
needed 5 seconds of squid footage in the trailer I guess, more lizards,
and a big lizard whose sole purpose in life is to rustle some serious
jimmies.But unfortunately, these scenes are sprinkled between around 2 hours of
having the camera choppily bob and weave between two separate groups
containing some of the most boring and uninteresting characters I have
ever come to forget. There is a cardboard hero who is good at
everything that the script needs him to be good at, a photographer who
takes, like, pictures I guess, and John C. Reilly, who is arguably the
closest this film gets to an interesting character.And this is not because of the script. This is because he is John C.
Reilly adding his own touch to the script he was given, like Gordon
Ramsay doing his best after being handed a bag of plain rice and half
of a dildo.Everybody else is a nameless nothing that we get to see be picked off
by giant insects in front of some of the worst green screen I have seen
in some time. Good, lord. What time of day was it again? Because I
swear to sweet baby Christ on a cracker that the sun set about six or
seven different times in the same day.The helicopter's encounter followed (after seemingly quite some time)
by the final throw-down between Kong and captain ptorsodactyl
mcwigglynoodle was what truly got me through the cringe-inducing humor
and painfully humorous deaths.This is one of those red-box gems that you'll have a better time with
once there is a beer in your hand rather than a 7 dollar popcorn.03/10",118,2017

hour-long network retrospective and a decent tribute to Peter Sellers. It
mostly plays that way anyway, with a ""plot"" which is simply dropped halfway
through, serving only as one of the framing devices to introduce the Sellers
clips. The other framing device, a reporter's series of interviews with
Clouseau's associates, is so inanely written and obviously ""tribute-y"" that
it's shocking to remember that this was a theatrical feature
film.And that was Blake Edwards' major mistake. Some of the unused footage is
amusing, but if it had been up to Sellers' usual hilarious standard, it
wouldn't have gone unused. And the flashback sequences are made up of, well,

their marriage. The movie is getting real honest approaching the
human's allowance to forgiveness when the confrontation between the
""broken"" family and the one responsible for that finally has place. It
might appear to be a simple story but it's not thanks to the patience
and passion the director, John Cameron Mitchell, invested in it.
Dazzling visually and very inspiring, this movie succeeds to entertain,
amaze and replenish it's audience with hope in totality.Carried not only by it's execution but also by it's memorable
Oscar-worthy performances, Rabbit Hole finds himself to be one of the
best movies of 2010. Nicole Kidman as the simple Becca, offers one of
her best performances in a long time. It's a simply astounding, honest
and passionate performance of this weakened but reasonable and powerful
woman that must be rewarded by the Academy with at least a nomination
if not the award itself. Aaron Eckart does not get over-shadowed by
Kidman's performance and proves once again that by portraying Becca's
husband, Howie, his acting capabilities exceed our expectations. There
are also notable performances by Dianne Wiest as Becca's mother and
Miles Teller as the one responsible for the suffered loss.Visually the movie finds it's own identity in the beautiful palette of
colors. The cinematography it's the most you could ask for this kind of
movie. There's no need for any other requirements. The most beautiful
thing though it's the soundtrack which as simple as it might be... it
fits the atmosphere and the story perfectly. Those violin and guitar
chords, the little piano rolling in the background create a unique
peaceful mood.What I do want at the end of my review is to recommend this movie to
anyone because it's simple but stunning, it's usual but complex,
carried by three overwhelming performances. This is without a doubt one
of the best movies released this year.",0,2010
46,12.0,6.8,"1978 saw the release of many anti-Vietnam films. While both ""Coming
Home"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" were big successes commercially and
critically, ""Who'll Stop the Rain"" was unfortunately overlooked for
some reason, which is a shame. Despite being set in America and
marketed originally as an action thriller, its an effective portrayal
of the mental strain of veterans returning from the horrific war. Its
not completely successful - occasionally the screenplay is a bit
muddled and sometimes the treatment of such disturbing material is too
genteel. Still, the story is so compelling it manages to nail its point
home by the end. The conclusion in particular is downbeat to the point
of sheer nihilism.What makes the film work so well, in addition to a good script, is the
acting. All around, the entire cast gives fantastic performances.
There's not a single weak note in the ensemble. Nick Nolte, an often
ridiculed performer, shows he can be a remarkably powerful actor if he
applies himself. Tuesday Weld is not as glamorous as she usually is,
which helps her create one of her most compelling roles. Michael
Moriarty is good also as the morally ambiguous character who manages to
be sympathetic by the end. The villains in the cast are all unlikable
but also well developed, especially the two thugs who show signs of
changing their hearts. The direction by Karel Reisz isn't anything
masterful on an aesthetic level, but it definitely gets the job done.
""Who'll Stop the Rain"" is a powerful and intelligent film, a kind of
movie that would only be released by a mainstream studio in the 70s and
would be extinct in the next decade of American cinema being overrun
and dumbed down by Jerry Bruckenheimer. (8/10)",126,1978
47,9.333333333333334,6.7,"Peter Sellers' final performance as Inspector Jacques Clouseau is also
one of the best.Looking for a way to restore the Godfather's faith in him, a mobster
(Robert Wbber), sets out to eliminate the greatest enemy of the French
underworld: Clouseau, whose dumb luck has allowed him to accidentally
bust crime again and again! Through a strange turn of events and a case
of mistaken identity, the mobster thinks he has succeeded in killing
Clousea.The Pink Panther was originally a diamond in the first film in this
series, but at this point the name has become synonymous with Clouseau.
The presumed dead Inspector teams up with the villain's ex-girlfriend
(Dianne Cannon) and seeks out to solve his own murder and get his
""revenge."" There are now glaring inconsistencies in the continuity of
the series. Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who tried to take
over the world and was disintegrated in the previous film is now not
only alive and well but is reinstated to a position of responsibility
in the police force.But the Pink Panther series isn't about continuity, anyway. It's about
humor. And Sellers and crew serve it up in generous quantities. While
some routines are recycled from previous films, there are a few new
bits that make the movie worthwhile.There are two especially hilarious scenes. One is a trip through the
insane asylum during which Clouseau has a run-in with a jealous
""Hercule Poirot"" (you'll see). It's subtle, clever, and very funny. The
second is a sequence in which Clouseau finds out his manservant Kato
(Burt Kwouk), believing Clouseau to be dead, has turned the detective's
apartment into an Oriental brothel.Then there's wacky disguises, Clouseau's ridiculous accent (crazier
here than ever), and the comic ""action"" scenes involving shoot-outs and
car chases. Kato is given a bigger sidekick role than usual here, and
Sellers' final moment as Clouseau is perfect: walking off into the
moonlit night, arm-in-arm with a beautiful woman, explaining what made
him decide to become a policeman in the first place. This film was
truly the end of an era.",99,1978

49,12.5,5.8,"Just saw it at the Dublin Film Festival and, to be honest, wasn't very
impressed. It was shown in the Irish category so I thought it would be
one of those Irish films that are usually low-budget but personal,
fresh and original. This one was none of that. It would be more in line
with Hugh Grant's romcoms. I mean it's nice to watch with your missus,
plenty of jokes thrown in, but it's more ""one of those films"" than
""must not miss"". I am not sure if it qualifies for a ""Dublin film""
either. You need to be Irish or at least someone with deep love for
Dublin to make a truly ""Dublin film"". Here, the director/writers are
not Irish and hardly been to Ireland before the film. They were just
told (according to Q&A session) that Ireland is a cheaper place to film
in, so they hired an Irish writer, changed the background to Dublin,
and voilà - got an Irish film. Kind of cynical. So it's more ""filmed in
Dublin"". Although the location crew did make a decent job of trying to
avoid the usual clichés. So at least, you'll get some nice shots of the
modern Dublin.",91,2013

unbalanced and the narrative goes all over the place but I suppose that
is the point. Acting is well delivered from all, with Cera playing the
same socially awkward, insecure guy as usual (but what's wrong with
that, he's the right actor for the role)In short: The story is predictable but that's to be expected. The
dialogue between the two leads is interesting and enjoyable. Music
works excellently throughout, fitting of each scene. Colour is used
well. Cinematography is fine (the scene where the two meet is clichéd

51,14.0,6.3,"Gods and Generals (despite the ravages of many critics) is a very good film.
The acting, writing, cinematography are all of top quality. Billy Crystal
once said, ""We know where we would be without the critics, but where would
they be without us?"" This film is historically accurate, deeply moving, and
with outstanding acting by all concerned. Stephen Lang's performance of
Stonewall Jackson should be remembered at Oscar time. Some critics condemn
it as being sympathetic with the Southern cause. Jeff Daniels and others
give their side in eloquent dialogue for their feelings on the conflict. I
suppose Gone With the Wind would be criticized the same if released today.
Since the story revolves around Stonewall Jackson it will obviously give his
point of view on the subject also. The religious overtones given by the
characters of both sides conformed with the religious feelings of the times
that is lacking today and as such it gives the critics something else to
condemn. And the moving scene with human emotions between Jackson and the
little Corbin girl brings the human touch to the character. What is wrong
with the critics....they must have slept through most the film. They say it
is pro-slavery. There are at least three fine speeches by Martha, Jim Lewis
and Lawrence Chamberlain bringing out the wrongness of that issue. Even
Jackson says that slavery should be abandoned. Such is a great movie trashed
by the critics and they miss the whole reason for this masterpiece. I give
it ten stars. See it, and decide for yourself about this film. Every minute
of it's close to four hours is worth it. Yep. Yep. And

three films have a good deal of charm and the cast has genuine
chemistry. 'D3' is just really enjoyable stuff. Emilio Estevez isn't around much
(still billed first in the credits, though) and he is missed despite
the original film's central relationship between him and the kids being
repeated here with a new coach. But there's enough here that's new to
the series (if not to cinema in general) to make this worthwhile once
the weak opening is out of the way.David Newman's score is genuinely good, making the hockey games rousing

53,11.0,6.6,"Another of my guilty pleasures is AIRPORT, the 1970 all-star cast drama
based on the best selling novel by Arthur Hailey. This soapy potboiler
follows multiple stories throughout a busy metropolitan airport.
Subplots that appeared in the book naturally had to be watered down or
removed entirely, but that was to be expected in telling a story of
such size back in the late 60's. However, after 35 years, I still find
this film a lot of fun to watch (even though it really should be
experienced in a theater). Burt Lancaster is all stone-faced authority
as Mel Bakersfield, the airport manager who neglects his wife (Dana
Wynter) while lusting after his passenger relations agent (Jean
Seberg). Dean Martin almost gives an actual performance as Vernon
Demarest, the smooth-talking pilot who also neglects his wife (Barbara
Hale) while having an affair with a stewardess (lovely Jacqueline
Bisset)whom he has impregnated. George Kennedy began his long
association with the character of Joe Patroni here(he would play the
role in three subsequent sequels). Van Heflin is extremely effective as
D.O. Guerrero, the sad and twisted man who plans to blow up an
airliner. Helen Hayes won an Oscar playing Ada Quonsett, a little old
lady who stows away on the plane, but that Oscar should have gone to
Maureen Stapleton, who is just devastating as Guerrero's wife, who is
totally dismayed about her husband's plan and is tragically
heartbreaking during one brief scene near the end of the film. For
those who like their adventure films spiced with some somewhat corny,
soap suds, put your brain in check and have your fill with AIRPORT.",137,1970

good movie, but could have been better if made into a mini-series and
more of the stories in the plot could have been developed more fully. I
realize this isn't always possible, but in the case of this movie, so
many important plot twists were left out it was kind of hard to
recognize the story. I think the casting was pretty good and this is a

59,4.5,6.3,"Spoilers Ahead:If you go into this movie expecting Anthropoid, you will be greatly
disappointed. Be warned, it is a very small quiet movie about a German
couple whose beloved son is killed at the start of the movie. Gleeson,
and, above all, Emma Thompson's gifts as actors carry the movie. The
best scene is where Anna receives the fateful telegram. Thompson's best
scene, she really impressed me here. Her movies tend to be out of the
genres that I watch (Romance), she is a skilled actress. The couple's
devastation is largely wordless; their lives are shattered. Otto is the
one who decides to strike back against the government that killed his
son. Anna, at first, is quite shocked but she warms to the plan. They
begin leaving cards of denunciation all around their area; soon, the
Gestapo is charting the cards' location and the noose begins closing.
What I like about is how understated and against your typical script
the movie is. First, the couple has an unhappy marriage; there are
quiet moments of recrimination, some bitter words, and, they largely
keep their distance from each other. In contrast to In The Bedroom, as
the movie plays, their rebellion pulls them back together again. They
both know the end of this story, as we do as well. Second, the life
shattering grief is so well done: a carved wooden bust of their son's
face, Anna holds it close to her silently weeping. Second: the violence and torture are all off screen. When Otto is
captured, we see his head running with blood. Unlike Anthropoid, there
is no gruesome on screen violence. I gave Anthropoid a 9, I adore the
movie. This director made all the opposite choices about how he wanted
to render the tragedy. The movie is like a noose tightening about their
necks. This sense of foreboding haunts both of them: near misses, close
calls, narrow escapes but, we the viewers, know what is coming. There
are a few scenes of a Jewish elderly lady, who is being hidden by other
kind people, but, she is a reflection of the main story, her luck runs
out. When they come, she makes the wise brave decision. You will see
the dreadful power of the SS: when the Gestapo man tries to tell them
they arrested the wrong man, watch what happens. This pressure is
captured in my favorite scene, the SS proffer Gestapo boy a shot glass,
as they standing over bleeding Otto. When they finish drinking, they
throw the glasses into Otto's head full force. The Gestapo man has
guilt for not saving Anna, he hesitates, watch the baleful glares he
receives from the SS. The glares say,""You are next if you don't do
likewise."" Yes, the detractors are correct, it is a relatively slow study of how
grief makes these ordinary German working people become the most
unlikely of rebels. I gave it a seven for the writing and the excellent
performances of Thompson and Gleeson. I liked Gleeson's Otto but I was
much more impressed with Thompson's Anna. She speaks very little, she
has to use her expressive eyes and body language. SPOILER: I love when
they are facing the phony show trial, also not shown, and she grasps
Otto's hand. Otto says,""You know what is going to happen don't you?""
Anna squeezes his hand,""It doesn't matter."" She puts such love in her
eyes, Otto loses much of his apprehension. This is the motif: Their
love for their dead son was expressed by actions that destroyed them.
They gave their lives trying to save other peoples' sons. I admired the
movie for the message: Everyone can make a difference; they suffered
the same fate as more violent rebels like Flame and Citron. Yet, their
rebellion was just as brave. If you asked me the lesson of Alone In
Berlin, I would say: ""We are all alone, within our societies, but we
can fight for Right in the way to which we were best gifted by God."" We all must die, they showed the world how to die well. They gave their
beloved dead son the best gift you could ever give another. They saved
others by laying down their lives. I really liked this movie, yes, it
is slow, but has a great beauty about it: Leave Some Cards Behind You.

Well, I believe that early on in my life, I learned about
some-
thing called ""Poetic License""....and, in fact, this film

basically, a poem.
The movie is BASED on a letter that Beethoven actually DID write, to his

woman really was. And, this is simply a beautiful interpretation of
someone's dream of who she COULD'VE been.This was regarded as an AWFUL thing to do, by many Beethoven

open-mindedness - was an exquisite blend of glorious music,
and SUPREME acting.Once again, Mr. Oldman gave a performance like no other

64,4.0,6.0,"Comedian Dax Shepard has been acting on screen for years without making
it big. He is perhaps best known as Kristen Bell's husband and being
part of the main cast in drama series Parenthood"" which doesn't
actually say a whole lot either. But he is one of those actors who is willing to write, produce and even
direct his own stuff if satisfying offers don't come his way. And
CHIPS"" must be one of these pet projects, because he fills all four
jobs mentioned above, sharing the screen with co-star Michael Peña. There are actually bunch of other cool faces around in smaller roles,
including  of course  Kristen Bell. But it's mostly about Shepard and
Peña offering a buddy action comedy, so if you feel like you could like
them, it's half a win for the movie already. (Sadly, there's smaller number of famous friends on screen than in
Shepard's previous projects, 2010's Brother's Justice"" and 2012's Hit
and Run"". I guess Bradley Cooper and Tom Arnold felt that they have
done enough for him and let him sink or swim alone now.)Shepard is convincing in the sensitive/wise doofus role that he has
chosen to himself, although his acting range seems limited in general. So he has surrounded himself with some rock solid players, starting
with Peña who has the coveted ability to make every movie a bit more
better just by appearing there. In this regard, he's like a young- ish
Latin version of Morgan Freeman, or something. What is more important here: Peña can effortlessly do action, drama and
comedy and there's need for all three here, Shepard couldn't hold the
fort alone. And speaking of solid, we also have Vincent D'Onofrio who
is every inch as imposing and magnetic as we have come to expect from
this veteran thespian.Based on the classic TV series of the same name (1977-83), it's about
the adventures of two California Highway Patrol cops. But it's not the
eighties anymore, so we get currently widespread type of raunchy
mainstream comedy with some action. If you want to measure the general style of the story and also the
nastiness of the dialogue, you should check out the Red Band trailer,
for example. It is not able to effectively share the quite enjoyable
buddy comedy vibe CHIPS"" has during most of its running time, but you
do get an idea if you would like to see some more of it.The result is probably most enjoyable for the little teenage boy in all
of us, with plenty of cursing, light violence and sex- or body- related
jokes. If you can't catch their wave, you will probably be a little
tired when the end comes. I actually enjoyed most of this raunchy silliness although I felt that
the ending felt a bit rushed and half-hearted.It's easy to imagine that the success of 21 Jump Street"" movies made
pitching the project and gathering the money for CHIPS"" easier for
Shepard & Co. The projects are quite similar: old and loved TV series turned into
modern American comedy, two likable guys in the middle of it all,

true that epic themes make the greatest novels and films.  Here is a movie
that explores heroism, duty, patriotism, hope, fear and the futility of
war--all grand themes--explored in the confined, and collapsing, spaces of a
German u-boat.I saw this film when I was a freshman in college during a weekend that I
later dubbed my ""depressing movie festival."" (The Wall and Apocalypse Now
were the other weekend ""entries."")  Of these films, it was Das Boot that
haunted me--when I laid down at night, I saw Jurgen Proctow's pained blue
eyes.  When I woke in the morning, I felt as if I were escaping through the
hatch of the submarine.  I could not shake the images, and now some fifteen
years later, I still remember how completely meaningless the movie made
everything seem, and the nihilistic message stayed with me for a long, long
time.  How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level.  To
say this film is ""powerful"" seems so weak a description.Part of the ""power"" of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in
the direction.  So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly
fall into melodrama, over-acting, and overblown images.  Too much.  These
often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact
the viewer on anything more than a surface level.  Here, it is the small
moments which fill the screen.  Everywhere, all around is War, but for these
men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital ""W"".  It is
reality, not a grand concept.  The director lets the story shock and horrify
the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. 
Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes
to the very real impact of the film.Story is a 10, direction is a 10, acting is a 10 and the cinematography is a

managed to entertain throughout, making it worth seeing. However, where it fails is originality. The Battle Royale formula has
been done time and time again, and here we get the straightest form of
it, with zero deviation from the norm and zero unique perspective.
Where a movie like Circle tries to infuse some kind of basic
examinations of social themes, here there is no higher level to the
killings. And for this, the movie never once surprises with a thought
or an event. The characters are just shells of people; the bad guys are
caricatures of evil, the protagonists of good. There is never ambiguity
of character, in a movie where so much moral ambiguity should be
present due to the situation. So from minute one you know exactly who
will be a villain and who will be a hero, and the end game is obvious
from the start. It's a waiting game for the movie to arrive where you
know it is going, which makes it very unsatisfying once the action is
over.",0,2016

72,6.5,5.8,"'WILSON': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A comedy-drama, based on the 2010 graphic novel (of the same name) by
Daniel Clowes (who also wrote the screenplay). The film was directed by
Craig Johnson, who also helmed the 2014 indie hit 'THE SKELETON TWINS',
and it stars Woody Harrelson (in the title role). The movie tells the
story of a lonely, neurotic and extremely honest middle-aged man, named
Wilson, who goes looking for his teenage daughter, after just
discovering he had one. Laura Dern, Judy Greer and Isabella Amara also
costar in the movie. It's received a limited indie theatrical release
at the Box Office, and it's gotten mostly mediocre reviews from
critics. I also found the film to be far from perfect, but it's also at
least somewhat entertaining and insightful.Wilson (Harrelson) is a lonely middle-aged man, who's lived alone most
of his life. He's neurotic, and he's also uncomfortably open, and
honest, with almost everyone he meets; which causes most people to
distance themselves from him. Wilson was briefly married, to another
mentally unstable, and now drug addicted, woman named Pippi (Dern).
Pippi and Wilson conceived a child together, years earlier, but Wilson
was told the baby was aborted. When he finds out the child was born,
and she's now living with adoptive parents nearby, he feels the
obsessive need to meet her (Amara).I've never read the graphic novel that the film is based on, but I did
enjoy the quirky 2001 cult classic 'GHOST WORLD'; which Clowes also
wrote the screenplay to (and the comic book it was based on). I do
really like the Wilson character though, and I can really relate to him
in many ways (but definitely not in every way). I think Harrelson does
an outstanding job portraying him too, and the movie is quite involving
because of it. It's a little too unbalanced though, to highly recommend
it; it's just way too dark at times, in comparison to it's otherwise
upbeat nature.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:

unwatchable so I appreciate that they got the tone just right. The
child speaks to her from the womb but it never gets completely goofy.
The violence she commits is brutal and bloody and it doesn't attempt to
trivialize or justify their deaths.Despite that, there is entertainment to be had as the more she kills

on its face but soon realised the writing, acting and direction was all

and Clark Freeman make an unlikely mother-son couple but they sold
their roles and even made me emotional at times.The budget is indeed tiny, but it didn't take anything away from the
solid creepiness. Build-up was executed well, and the story moved
nicely from almost comedy to genuine scares. Even at the end this
little horror surprise stood its ground and avoided the usual sour
taste that most films in its genre leave behind.",89,2016
77,9.6,5.9,"What a beautifully shot film!! Excellent cinematography, it almost out
shone the stars!After reading copious amounts of Ben Hall literature in my youth this
is the best historically accurate telling without adding the usual
'Hollywood' style fluff to pad it out and make a more 'interesting'
movie to the detriment of the real tale. It shouldn't, and didn't need
it. Well done Mathew and crew!Jack Martin bought to life the best portrayal of Ben Hall yet, as did
the rest of the gang and support cast. Even though Jamie Coffa's John
Gilbert, with his 'boyish laugh', was a bit over the top and sometimes
annoying, I reckon the real Gilbert probably was too.The costuming and set detail is one of the best I've seen to recreate
an accurate picture of the period. That's something that's usually goes
astray. Even right down to the accurate detail of the weaponry used
which would have maybe even impressed the late bushranger historian
Edgar Penzig. A hard man to please.The great music score only added the majesty of the scenery and the use
of traditional music off the period, always a must, added to the
authenticity. The song Ben Hall as the end piece was beautifully
haunting. The stunning work of Ross Morgan's portraits during the
credits must also get a mention.The gun battles were excellently and excitingly shot while the last
scenes of Ben's demise were very moving to say the least. Those bastard

78,13.5,6.1,"Though the plot may be familiar (mistrustful pair teamed together to go on a
dangerous assignment), the premise of having two snipers as the protagonists
is interesting. The film builds on this by offering an insight into the
psychological effects of this kind of warfare, but ultimately this
degenerates into a yarn. One with a particularly limp ending at
that.Berenger is convincing in his portrayal of a hardened, veteran sniper,
completely impassive in what he does. Zane, however, doesn't really pull off
his role as an Olympic medal winning shooter who has to face his first live
kill. The pairing never truly gels, which is a shame as it's their
relationship that's important over the actual plot.The film looks great, largely set deep in the Panamanian jungle. There are

kid.
I just finished watching for the first time in 16 years, with mixed
opinions. First, the story is good. The dialogue is decent (swearing in a
Disney kids movie? Right on!). The cinematography is ok. The directing is
pretty good. The acting is okay. The music is HORRIBLE. I've noticed, not
only with this picture, but almost every Disney movie from the late 60s on
into the mid 80s, if you turn the music off, it's actually more enjoyable
to
watch. Being a music theory major in college, I have come to really
appreciate good scoring for movies. There are several scenes where the
music
is entirely inappropriate (such as after the crash, when they're rounding
up
all the equipment and animals and the music is straight from Yee Haw).
Still, after all these years, it was good to watch it again. So if you can
cringe your way through the sappy music, you're good to go with this edgy
Disney movie.",97,1980
80,6.8,6.5,"""I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat"" is an animated short film from 2011, so this
one had its 5th anniversary last year and it is a bit of back to the
roots as here we have a new modern take by writer and director Matthew
O'Callaghan on the eternal story of Sylvester trying to catch Tweety.
Of course, Granny is around as well as if Tweety would not make things
complicated enough already for the kitty. It is pretty short, runs for
3.5 minutes only, so half the length roughly as these cartoons did back
in the day. Mel Blonc was long dead already when they made this, but he
still leaves a lasting impression and his song is probably the only
somewhat decent aspect of this little movie. Oh yeah, June Foray as
Granny is on board too, very fitting character for her as she is about
to turn 100 in a few months. Anyway, the comedy was not good in here at
all, the animation did not really impress me either and I cannot agree
with the Annie Awards appreciation for this one. It's not new or
creative or innovative, but maybe it can get a few people interested
again in the cartoons from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, then it is okay
it was made. Besides that, I give it a thumbs-down though and don't
recommend the watch, maybe because even back then Sylvester and Tweety
were never among my favorites compared to the many many other WB
characters or Disney too.",0,2011

82,10.333333333333334,5.6,"In recent years, there really hasn't been many truly great action
flicks to warrant fans of the genre to go to the theaters. Sure, there
has been a few entries in classic action series like Rambo and Indiana
Jones hat met with varied success, but not much in the line of fresh
new flicks has been produced (Except the awesome Crank). Thus we come
to a film that really garnered next to no hype and slipped quietly into
theaters, 12 Rounds. Is it the movie action fans have been yearning
for? Danny Fisher, played by WWE superstar John Cena, is a New Orleans
detective faced with a problem: an old terrorist named Miles he
arrested a year back has broken out of jail and has taken Fisher's
girl. Now the only way to get her back is to complete 12 rounds of a
""game"" that Miles created to finally get revenge on the cop that ruined
his life. It's an unlikely scenario to be sure, but hey, this is an
action flick, so it's just preposterous enough to make for an
interesting plot. The thing I don't understand though is the fact that
in the trailer for 12 Rounds, it is said to be directed by the same
director who did Die Hard 2, and produced by the Speed producer. Why is
this odd? Well, it is obvious right from the start that 12 Rounds is a
blatant rip-off of Speed right down to some scenes being near
carbon-copies. Well, at least they ripped off the cream of the action
genre crop I guess.One of the major compliments I feel I have to give to the filmmakers
comes in that no noticeable CGI was used anywhere in the movie. CGI has
been overused way too much as of late, so to see an action movie with
good ol' fashioned stunts and explosions is great. What's better than
no CGI is how all the action is done incredibly well. Between great car
chases, huge explosions, and nicely choreographed fights, it's a feast
for the eyes. Of course, all this awesomeness couldn't just stay
awesome thanks heavily to the awful camera-work. Similar to Quantum of
Solace's quick cuts and shaky camera during action sequences, 12 Rounds
makes it difficult at times to tell what the hell is going on. I don't
see what is wrong with traditional camera-work where viewers can
actually enjoy the high-quality special effects since they can be seen
in all their glory, but I digress.Honestly, there really isn't much to say about this one. If you are an
action fan that has already seen every Stallone and Schwarzenegger
movie under the sun, then 12 Rounds is sure to entertain on a rainy
afternoon. Granted, it doesn't bring much to the table in terms of new
concepts or anything like that, but it's entertaining, and that all
that really matters, right? Again, it's a complete and utter rip-off of
Speed, but it's a damn fine rip-off, and I would be willing to call
this Speed 2 more than that pathetic piece of crap film with the cruise
ship. After jumping to conclusions when I saw John Cena as the star and
it being a WWE Production, I was genuinely surprised by the
entertainment value found within, and I think that if viewers go in
with the right mindset, they too will have a great time.",108,2009

84,4.666666666666667,5.8,"I've been reviewing films off and on for about five years. And if there
is one thing I've learned about criticism is that the vast,
unchallenged mean between absolutely great movies and downright
terrible ones hides a lot of non-committal fence sitting. I'm guilty of
it myself; in today's age of instant self-gratification, it's easy to
cobble together a knee-jerk opinion based on someone else's ideas.
Problem is those ideas, whether valid or not, sometimes creates a
subterfuge of undeserved hype or undeserved vitriol depending on the
circumstance. They feed a cycle of wafer-thin subjectivity masquerading
as authoritative proof of something's worth. This is why, for example a
movie like Equilibrium (2002) can be seen as something more than a
splashy Matrix (1999) rip-off while movies like Mystery Team (2009) are
swept under the rug.So it is with Table 19, a movie no one will likely see because the
critical consensus is so bad that it's created its own negative
feedback loop. Table 19 takes place over the course of several hours of
a wedding reception at a rustic hotel lodge. As the happy couple
celebrates their new marriage amid friends and family, a small group of
strangers sit at the back table, forcing uncomfortable banter and
gracelessly ignoring the reason for their position in the back. Among
them are the argumentative Kepps (Kudlow and Robinson), the dotty Ms.
Jo (Squibb), gawky teen Renzo (Revolori), distant cousin Walter
(Merchant) and Eloise (Kendrick) the disgraced ex-Maid of Honor who was
dumped by the Best Man (Russell).To say Table 19 is ""ridiculous and a mess,"" is a bit of an
understatement. As critics rightly point out, the pacing is stop and
go, the editing is slapdash and the high-concept simply doesn't have
the wherewithal to make it through a feature-length movie. Once the
initial awkward niceties are flushed under the force of the first big
narrative reveal, the film descends into a checklist of soapy
plot-points and lazy character short hands. Much like 8 Heads in a
Duffel Bag (a similarly imperfect ensemble farce), Table 19 klutzily
mixes its farcical elements with broad, sweeping story setups and has
them slosh about until the runtime wears out. On top of it all, the
tone shifts wildly depending on who you're following at the time.Thing is, I actually liked 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag, and I liked Table
19 too for much the same reason. The characters, as broad as they may
be at times never ceased to entertain; Stephen Merchant's portrayal as
a familial pariah Franken-walking through the banquet hall is worth the
admission price alone. As are Renzo's far too honest conversations with
his mother (Martindale in a superb unseen role) which mostly consist of
him rolling his eyes while she pushes him to ""get laid already."" Behind
the Kepps' increasingly hostile quibbling and Grandma Jo's insistence
that she'll be remembered (just you wait), lays a unified feeling of
melancholy.That feeling of melancholy along with some solid comedic setups and
payoffs permeate through the film's cosmetic faults. Every time you're
distracted by an awkward cut or taken aback by some of the more hammy
moments, the film quickly lulls you back with its quixotic charm.Helping to dry up this mess and put it back into a nice looking bucket
is the relentless Anna Kendrick who by now has turned the neurotic
jilted girl archetype into a symbol of quasi-empowerment. While she
wins no brownie points for that here, there's something near noble
about the way she throws herself into the fray. She easily elevates an
already stellar cast and sells the hell out of the movies main conceit.Much like the twangy banjo version of Pachabel's Canon in D that plays
over the film's title sequence, Table 19 is a unique version of a very
old cultural tradition. It's certainly not the best version of what it
could be but with more than a handful of charming performances, this
delightful little farce deserves a little better than the wedding
inspired japes it's been getting from critics. Perhaps it's a case of
ugly duckling syndrome on my part, but I'm going to go ahead and say ""I
Do"" to this one.",87,2017

United Kingdom about the men who serve on air sea rescue duty. No
glamor here, just professional men doing a job, rescuing air crews down

old Royal Air Force rescue station give a ring of authenticity.Four men are on a rubber dinghy in the North Sea after being shot down

for the V-2 rockets with which the British public shortly became
acquainted with.A rescue sea craft commanded by Anthony Steel is sent to find them and
pick them up. Not so easy with a prevailing mist over the North Sea.
The dinghy is also in fact drifting east towards the occupied
Netherlands. The best scenes in the film are on the dinghy. I'm reminded a bit of
Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat which was an ocean liner compared to what
our RAF airmen are occupying. Best acting honors go to Dirk Bogarde as
the Flight Sergeant who is trying to keep the famous British stiff
upper lip, but is losing out fast to the numbness and cold. It's bad

during the centennial observances of events over the four-year period.
Quite a few films were released either about the war, or which had the
war in the background or as preludes to western films, which were very
popular at the time. This film fits within that genre - both as a
""civil war"" film, which is also a bit of a ""western"", considering the
cattle-rustling angle.This movie is (loosly) based upon an actual event. In September of
1964, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was besieged by Grant's forces in
entrenchments which stretched along the eastern side of Richmond, then
south across the James river, then along the southern border of
Petersburg, Virginia. A confederate scout noticed a large heard of
cattle (approaching 4000 head) located at Coggins Point on the James
River, not far from Grant's headquarters. In the army parlance of the
days before refrigeration or canning to preserve meat, this was
referred to by the commissary services as ""beef on the hoof"".Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton organized a raid which swung wide
around the Union lines, traveled through Union-held territory to the
site, overcame the small guard, and herded 2,468 cattle back into the
Confederate lines where it became a welcome addition to the scanty
rations the Confederate troops normally received. The Confederate
losses were quite small - 10 killed, 47 wounded, and 4 missing,
according to Hampton's official after-action report.The raid went down in history as either ""Hampton's Cattle Raid"", or
simply ""The Great Beefsteak Raid"".Of course, the lead character ""Alverez Kelly"" from the movie has no

I've also worked on a Villisca-related project, co-writing, directing

don't care for the picture but I wouldn't, regardless of whether or not
I myself had made one. It's lodged very uncomfortably in a very small
space: true crime meets paranormal activity meets teen slasher flick.
Finding the intersection of those circles is going to be dicey work
indeed and, having attempted something like it, we may have to admit
that it cannot be done at all.The picture isn't all bad - some elements are exceedingly well-done -
but the more important point, to me, is that the case has not attracted
and given rise to the sort of high-achieving work we who are familiar
with it believe could be produced.What's the problem? I wish I knew. I've often described the case as an
itch between the shoulder blades, the itch that takes up residence in
that one insanely inaccessible spot. You feel you'll go mad if you
can't somehow deal with it. So you write a book, you write a song, you
make a movie. They're all undertaken with the best of intentions, and
they all fall short (Roy Marshall's book, ""Villisca,"" comes the closest
to fullness, combining a law officer's obsession over evidence with a
folksy charm that lifts the endeavor onto a higher plane, one

life. She was ahead of her time in being a very independent-minded
career woman and developed a reputation for being difficult to work
with. She had a decades-long marriage which ended in divorce, but
produced one child, a daughter. In her later years, she has remained
active in trying to shape her legacy, which is clearly seen in her 2017
comedy-drama ""The Last Word"" (R, 1:48). Advertising executive Harriet
Lauler has had quite a career  and an interesting life. She was ahead
of her time in being a very independent-minded career woman and
developed a reputation for being difficult to work with. She had a
decades-long marriage which ended in divorce, but produced one child, a
daughter. In her later years, she has become active in trying to shape
her legacy, which is what the 2017 comedy-drama ""The Last Word"" is all
about. Now, art-imitating-life parallels aside, playing Harriet serves
to remind us how busy MacLaine has remained, on screens big and small,
even as her 70s drifted into her 80s  and what a singular talent she
remains.""Control is very important to Harriet,"" one character observes. That's
an understatement  and an incomplete one too. Not only has Harriet
Lauler (Shirley MacLaine) always exerted control over as many parts of
her life as possible, she was always been very disagreeable as she did
so. Years ago, she angrily quit the ad agency that she helped to found
because she didn't like how one of her clients conducted a focus group.
She once told her gynecologist(!), ""When I want your opinion, I'll give
it to you."" Her parish priest even admits, ""I hated her. So much.""
These days, Harriet's retired. She lives alone in her big house and
exerts her brand of rude control by chastising her gardener for
trimming her hedges from top to bottom, instead of from bottom to top,
as she has instructed him, ""many times"" he admits with a sigh. Then,
when she reads someone's obituary in her local newspaper, she finds
something else to control.Harriet visits the paper's offices and asks the editor, Ronald Odom
(Tom Everett Scott), to introduce her to the obituary writer, Anne
Sherman (Amanda Seyfried). Sitting behind Ronald's desk, Harriet gives
Anne the assignment to write her obituary now, so she can be sure
she'll be satisfied with what will be published about her in the
newspaper after she is gone. Ronald tells Anne that Harriet had been a
great friend to the paper when she did ads for Ronald's father and
implies that she might remember the paper in her will. ""Make her
happy,"" is Ronald's simple instruction to Anne, who reluctantly gets to
work. The problem is that there just isn't much to say about Harriet
beyond her past career accomplishments  and Anne can't find a single
person to say anything nice about her  even from the list of names
that she received from Harriet herself. Naturally, Harriet is
dissatisfied with Anne's first draft  and tells her so.Harriet has read a number of obituaries and determined that there are
four things that make a good obituary: a loving family, the respect of
co-workers, touching the life of someone who needs a helping hand and
a wild card, something unique in the life of the deceased that provides
the proverbial icing on the cake. Harriet knows that Anne won't write
anything about Harriet that is not truthful, so she gets Anne to help
her ""shape a legacy"". Without giving away how all of this shakes out,
I'll just say that this journey puts Harriet and Anne in touch with
Harriet's ex-husband (Phillip Baker Hall), Harriet's estranged daughter
(Anne Heche), a former co-worker (Joel Murray), an at-risk youth
(AnnJewel Lee Dixon) and a charming disc jockey (Thomas Sadoski). And
as the two women work together on Harriet's unusual project, she does
some unwelcome, but well-intentioned meddling in Anne's personal life
as well.""The Last Word"" is a relatively original and very well-done genre film.
Sure, it's formulaic, but movies use formulas for a reason. The real
question is whether the film tells its story effectively and this one
definitely does. The script from Stuart Ross Fink (writing his first
feature) creates a fresh take on the trope of examining a life
not-so-well-lived and gives us interesting characters. The excellent
actors bring out the nuances in those characters and director Mark
Pellington (""Arlington Road"", ""The Mothman Prophecies"") gives the film
a great balance of comedy, drama, life lessons and just plain fun. The
film's ending may be predictable, but getting there is a very rewarding
experience. Movie Fans (especially fans of Ms. MacLaine) will likely be
thankful that, with other projects in the works, this film won't be the
last word in Shirley MacLaine's stellar career. It also makes us look
forward to much more to come from the talented Seyfried, the spunky
newcomer Dixon and rookie writer Fink, with this impressive debut. This
great mix of well-established talent with others just starting out
makes for one enjoyable film. ""A-""",108,2017
99,10.0,6.2,"It is this reviewer's humble opinion that British children's
literature, with its whimsical nature and picturesque settings, is the
best of its kind. It is also this reviewer's opinion that British
filmmaking best capitalises on these elements, making for full-length
features that are every bit as captivating as their source material.Set against the backdrop of the 1930s English Lake District (shot on
location and realised here in breathtaking aerial views), Swallows and
Amazons sees an innocent childhood sailing adventure become embroiled
in a sinister conflict of interest between two mysterious parties.
Though it preceded Enid Blyton's Famous Five stories it is strikingly
similar in tone, and reinforces the notion that childhood detective
fiction has been consistently appealing to us from Arthur Ransome's
classic novel through to the television adventures of Scooby Doo.Held up by a veteran supporting cast including Harry Enfield and Kelly
McDonald, the young Walker children are all an enthusiastic delight,
chiefly responsible for rendering this particular adaptation so
cheerily playful for the majority of its running time. Even when the
atmosphere shifts and the film must briefly cease to reminisce on the
carefree pleasures of our youths, the focus adapts accordingly to
challenge the audience's perspective on responsibility; as Rafe Spall's
cryptic Jim Turner tells an accountable John Walker, this is not
(always) a game. While the topic of childhood privileges is one which the film has no
obligation to comment on directly - the source material predating the
advent of smart electronics by a great length of time - there are
subtle nods to taking the great outdoors for granted which director
Philippa Lowthorpe delivers as contemplative gestures, rather than
heavy-handed sermons. Swallows and Amazons is precisely the film that
family audiences need in 2016; a reminder that a summer spent outdoors,
rather than five inches from a screen, is the most memorable of all.",97,2016

keeps you guessing.But what a letdown the ending was! It was like the director chickened
out, and went for the boy-gets-girl, American apple pie conclusion,
instead of creating a Gothic masterpiece. I would have sooner left some
of the plot threads unresolved than to have inflicted on me such a
silly and B-grade alternative, that ultimately left a bad taste in my

106,8.0,4.0,"OK, so here we go. ""The Last Face"" premiered during Cannes last year
and it got bashed by critics and even booed at. When I heard about that
I couldn't really believe it. I mean, a film directed by Sean Penn
starring Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem being that bad? It got me
curious to watch it. Because I needed to know if it was getting fair
reviews or not. It turned out to be a long wait, because It took a year
for it to finally come out in other countries. I went in with an open
mind. Ready to give it a deserving chance like every movie does. Well,
now after seeing it I understand where the problems lied. Although, I
must say right off the bat that it's not completely terrible... But it
does get messy.What I didn't like was that it got exaggerated and tried to force the
emotion rather then earning it. The romance was predictable and
typical. It goes through all the expected beats of ""Will they be
together or won't they?"" The movie uses narration and I thought it was
unnecessary. It would have worked better without filling the audience
in on the plot so often. I think people can figure it out perfectly
well on their own, because it just added to the melodrama. Which was
annoying at times with them over sympathizing the story and dragging
out moments. It was good whenever it just calmed down and showed some
realism. The premise itself is fine. Doctors going to Africa to help
people in need. I understood the overall message of mankind's goodwill.
The hospital/doctor scenes had some tension to them and they felt very
realistic. There's also a lot of gruesome and horrific imagery of
people's misfortune in Africa which was affecting. Those were the parts
that stuck with me. The characters were able to convince me in many
scenes, but unfortunately not the entire way through. It's sad, because
Bardem and Theron looks to have put so much effort into this.Like I said, the story of them being doctors and traveling in Africa to
help people was fine. It was the romantic story that dragged on and
felt clichéd. They should have toned it down and made the entire movie
more realistic and down to earth. I was able to see glimmers of what
could have been really good touching moments. Instead we get too much
melodrama with musical soundtrack telling you exactly how to feel
instead of the story itself making you feel something. Although there
was some music I liked in it: The local African songs and the Piano
tracks towards the end. There are scenes that are good. Scenes that
feel like real life stories with heart to them. The thing is that we
get so few of them spread across the movie. I was never able to truly
appreciate those scenes so well because the following part would often
drag it down again.Without spoiling anything, the final moments were finally able to get
some emotion across. The ending was my favorite part. It made me
finally care for what was going. It was a little too late. But hey, at
least it was something. The movie leaves you reflecting on life a
little bit. But not nearly as much as I'm sure the filmmakers wanted.
It does, however have its moments that work. And for that I will give
it points. The movie is not nearly as awful as some people are making
it out to be. It's just average. If you are looking for something to
pass the time with, then this will work fine. Just don't expect much.

two of the most talented and charismatic of female actresses in
Hollywood.""The Assignment"" didn't fail to impress. Surely, the storyline was a
bit offbeat, but that quickly seeped in and you get with the story and

Rodriguez as a man in the beginning of the movie, but it was done so
nicely that it actually looked quite real. Color me impressed.Of course it is a bit redundant to mention that ""The Assignment"" had a

113,11.0,4.4,"Looking at the cover of ""Off Piste"", you're expecting a pure survival
movie full of action and chases in a French snowy landscape. That's not
the case. It's rather a psychological drama in which processing a
traumatic experience is the central theme. First we meet Stanley
Winters (Henry Douthwaite) who during a military raid on a local pub,
where I.R.A. members were discussing something, accidentally shot the
young son of one of these members. And then there's Niamh O'Brien (Lara
Lemon) who witnessed the death of her younger brother and father that
evening as a young girl. Both are struggling with the past. Stanley
stows away his military combat uniform after this incident and moves to
the French Alps where he'll live with his blind mother (Yvonne O'Grady)
in a remote mountain cabin. There he tries to find inner peace.As Niamh discovers the real truth about the death of her father and
brother, she leaves Ireland confidently and travels to the French
mountain village. The further progress of the story seems to be
evident. You can only guess what motives Niamh has to find those
responsible. Is it to avenge her loss? A revenge because her life ended
up in a series of depressions? Or is it because she wants to deal with
the past and finally be able to leave it all behind? That the person
who took care of her afterwards still has a dossier lying around about
Winters, is an indication about the unlikely and the sometimes
nonsensical events.I liked the psychological aspect and thought it was interesting enough.
Stanley struggling with his inner demons and using a female
psychiatrist (who displays more uncertainties than her patient) to
channel his recovery. Even Stanley's mother tries to get her son back
on the right path so that he rediscovers the meaning of life. That's
why she acts like a mother hen, the moment Niamh arrives. As a true
matchmaker she tries to hook them up. She isn't aware of the dreadful
link that connects the two.What's the flaw in this film you wonder? The absurdity of the two
idiotic Irish guys, traveling headlong to the French Alps. Ethan (Jared
Fortune) , because he believes that he sees himself as the fiancée of
Niamh and he finds it hard to bear that she's looking for another man.
And then there's Logan (Paul McGuinness). He's just in it because he
has probably nothing else to do. They arrive at the French village like
two genuine Irish hooligans. Ethan confronts Niamh with the fact that
she first had to consult with him. A bit later he clears off like a
beaten dog after she made it perfectly clear to him what their
relationship is about. The resulting response is so excessive that the
credibility of the whole film is brought down. If these two skirts
hunters have experienced many rejections in their homeland, I fear the
female part of the population was decimated in number. I've always said
that foam-free, warm beer is fatal for human brain cells.So despite the beautiful renditions of Henry Douthwaite and Yvonne
O'Grady, ""Off Piste"" reasonably far-fetched. I understand that without
the intervention of Etahn and Logan the complete movie would be kind of
banal with just scenes of two traumatized souls. But as I said before,
the motivation for their intervention is totally whacked. Even the
ultimate action from Stanley is in terms of coincidence grossly
exaggerated. Regrettable. Because eventually I found the underlying
issue extremely interesting.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",91,2016
114,14.5,7.5,"This had been a holy grail film for me for many years, mostly from
reading Jonathan Rosenbaum's descriptions of it....sounded like a truly
sui generis film, a soldiers-stranded-on-island and reverting to
barbarism story told entirely with quite artificial-looking sets and
unsubtitled dialogue, with the director narrating...a completely
noncommercial film from a frustrated, bitter middle-aged director tired
of fighting the studio bigwigs, determined to make a truly personal
film whatever the cost.I finally located a pretty decent VHS copy a few months ago and watched
it last night, and I must say it equalled or even exceeded by
expectations -- this really is a film experience like nothing else out
there. The photography and sound, even on a somewhat soft and fuzzy
VHS, are just stunning -- the sound design in particular is worthy of
Lynch, and really the film as a whole is one of the weirdest American
features to be released before Eraserhead. Sternberg's narration
interacts in all kinds of ways with the action on screen, sometimes
anticipating events, sometimes contradicting what we see, sometimes
questioning...the hermetic world created on the sound-stage is
obviously unreal, and yet the lush beauty of the photography and sets
creates a unique otherworld as powerful as anything in the
massive-budgeted 'scope spectacles that would be Hollywood's
bread-and-butter for the next decade. It's as if Sternberg knew where
American film was headed, and told us he could do something much more
interesting at a fraction the price.And if all of this makes the film sound like an arid exercise in
technique and style -- fear not -- the ending, with the island's sole
woman reflecting back on the several men who met their deaths as the
result of their fighting over her, is powerfully emotional and
resonant.I'm not sure my comments are at all meaningful, this is a hard film to
wrap my head around...suffice it to say I recommend it as strongly as

Stephy has a nerdy friend who helps her record her demos, and he wants

town; they meet and he woos her with his charms and fortunes. Ecstatic, Stephy pack her bags and gets ready to leave behind smalltown
America for her newlyfound Hollywood fame. The main appeal of this film is the *extremely* unusual filmography.
Everything is filmed as if to make it appear that this is a dream, an

it's weird and surrealist. ***SPOILERS BELOW***I loved this film until 3/4 through. Pretty standard plot, standard
characters, but when i'm ready for the change of scenery, when Stephy

NO. The famous actor character is killed off, and Stephy loses with him
all hope of completing her character arc. I must assume that this was planned from the beginning, but this move

116,13.5,8.2,"The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film.
While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect
comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and
leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman
in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by
James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see
the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two
decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the
role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end
his cinematic legacy with.The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants
are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall
wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving
cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is
now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic
suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities.
Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who
he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much
more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the
Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is
probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER,
Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves,
the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version
of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it
should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a
fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a
film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely
heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This
is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the
source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or
Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies
the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very
well. The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance
here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his
career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like
this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has
been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're
mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience
feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards,
completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to
this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is
someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is
from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she
is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the
brutality.Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as
heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a
special film with this that should be talked about for years to come.
Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that
just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect
adaptation.",137,2017

and i have to admit i was dreading watching it because i thought it
would be sh*t, but i stand corrected it's totally funny i couldn't stop
laughing. The story is a married man called Bob seduces the babysitters
Ria and Sue in his car when parked out on the moors resulting in a
hilarious sex scene. The three continue their relationship of casual
sex and good times even though they know the truth will eventually be
known.As i said comedy is a big part of this film which is mainly from the
common accents and swearing from practically the whole cast (especially
Kevin, Sue's racist, drunkard dad). Other comedy moments are the old
nosey neighbour (Hosepipe Harry) who spends the whole film watering his
garden and the dance scene where Bob and the two girls are dancing to a
song called ""We're having a gang bang!"" which is funny just for Rita's
dancing (best moment in the film!) although a friend of Bob's wife (Fat
F*ckin' Mavis) sees them and tells her leading to a full scale argument
with the girls families and the married couple, which has more swearing
in the 5 minute scene then a whole series of the Osbournes.This is a great British film and anyone with a sense of humour will
enjoy it!",93,1987
118,11.5,6.6,"The film transported everyone back to October 20, 1944 where we seemed
to be part of the great Philippine 'I Shall Return' landing scene It
was on that Leyte shore where General MacArthur reaped his fame Above all, Gregory Peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great
general It is the stride, the set of the shoulders, the intensity
It's what both men have had in common: intensity, total absorption,
devotion With MacArthur it was for the military With Peck it was for
the challenge of acting An Academy Award winner for ""To Kill a
Mockinbird"", an Oscar nominee for ""Keys to the Kingdom"", ""The
Yearling"", ""Gentleman's Agreement"", and ""Twelve O'Clock High""he has
played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading
journalist; from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney; from
biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower He has brought to them
all his own unique insight, his character, his sincerity, warmth and
love, and especially, his humor There is a scene where 'MacArthur' stands on deck with the 'President
of the Philippines.' We can hear the dialogue: ""General, I hope the
water isn't too deep,"" says the 'President,' ""because my people will
find out I can't swim."" Then come Peck's sonorous voice: ""And my people
are going to find that I can't walk on water!"" As ""MacArthur,"" Peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in
the film industry Through him we felt MacArthur's emotions: we knew
his anger, his happiness and we understood the relationship with his
whole family",130,1977

best way to view Knucklebones is as a comedy of errors. Casting aside the predictable ""B"" grade credentials of this film, its

stick to it, is the main reason its such a mess. This flick constantly oscillates between vaguely formulated,
uninspiring ideas. Its as if the whole thing tries far too hard, to be
interesting and original. It would have been better off, I feel,
basking in its ""B"" grade glory and just sticking with a simpler slasher

125,13.75,7.4,"Beauty and the Beast is about a deposed slave-owning aristocrat who
imprisons a farm girl. She undergoes Stockholm Syndrome, identifying
with her captor, then proceeds to betray her village's uprising and
reinstates the slave-owning prince to power by offering her hand in
marriage.Furthermore, Belle's contempt for the provincial farming community and
their lack of refinement stems from vague memories she has of a more
cultured upbringing in Paris. When she later is shown a vision of her
childhood house and remarks ""it's so small,"" this was a moment where
she could put it all together. The lack of refinement in the rural areas was due to brutal
exploitation which forced unmarried women to beg in the streets. It is
likely that the community's surplus resources were taken by aristocrats
like the Beast, and used to fund his opulent palace. Thus, depriving
the farming community of leisure time and resources for education and
arts, which would have made them more sophisticated, meeting Belle's
approval.It is also possible that Gaston's intense desire to marry, which caused
his nefarious plot, may be linked to levée en masse, a policy that
required conscription for all unmarried French men between 18 and 25.
So his patriarchal demands were a direct result of state policy to
benefit the aristocracy by providing soldiers to sacrifice their lives
in land disputes between inbred blue blood cousins.Then, this exploitation provided a concentration of wealth and power in
the city, which created the market for her father to pursue creative
employment rather than farm work. This also forced them into slums,
where squalor and poor public health systems lead to the spread of
plague, which is met with cold indifference by the doctor, indicating
lack of public health care as a source of Belle's childhood trauma. All of this exploitation and upward wealth transfer made its way back
to the remote plantation of the Beast.When confronted with this inescapable logic, what does she do? She
decides to take the easy way out and enjoy the life of luxury, waited
hand and foot by Beast's slaves, who feed her, clothe her, sing and
dance for her. A life she always felt entitled to, on part of her
feeling of superiority towards her provincial neighbors.The moral of the story is, marry for money, and ignore the suffering of
the poor. A terrible message for children.",129,2017

Jacqueline Bisset, sees the imminent danger in nightmares. These dream
sequences that gradually unveil the shocking truth are extremely well
filmed
and the music enhances the emotional impact even further. This one is a
real
chiller with some very frightening moments and a very surprising end. Its
many disturbing images will haunt you for quite some time. It proves that
elegant filmmaking becomes the horror genre very well. I'd love to see The

127,3.0,7.0,"Loved this -- probably one of the funniest Will Hay films I've seen. I
far prefer the pictures he made with Charles Hawtrey to the 'classic'
teaming with Moore/Marriott, and an excellent supporting cast here
includes Peter Ustinov and Frank Pettingell (of ""Gaslight"" fame).I always find Hay funnier when he is being a pompous but resourceful
twit rather than simply an arrogant incompetent, and here his
schoolmaster character is put up against the Nazis and manages (with
assistance) to rise to the occasion... aided by the fact that his
opponents half the time are even bigger buffoons than he is. A sharp
script relies heavily on verbal humour, with two outstanding scenes
that riff on the absurdities of the English language. The invasion plan
sequence in which Hay improvises strategy wildly in a cascade of puns
while attempting to pick a German general's pocket deserves to be a
classic of the genre (take them from the flanks in Lancs to keep the
Paras all tied up in Notts... but don't get caught with your Panzers
down in the Severn Tunnel).There is also a clever yet natural-seeming series of gags making use of
an asbestos suit, some of which you can see (and enjoy) coming in
advance, some of which I didn't! The final reels of the film didn't
work quite so well for me, chiefly because I couldn't help but be aware
that with all those antics the plane wouldn't have lasted for a minute
and had some trouble suspending my disbelief in the name of comedy --
it's always funnier when it's actually physically plausible, however
far-fetched. (The ingenious tactic by which Hay contrives to prevent
his friend Professor Hoffmann from drinking a glass of poison by
triggering his ""Heil Hitler"" reflex precisely at the requisite moment,
for example.) Up to that point I would have rated the film at a
definite 8/10; I still rate it a solid seven.The contrast between English and American propaganda films was never
more marked; see also ""Night Train to Munich"", ""Pimpernel Smith"" and
even ""The Lady Vanishes"" for Englishmen working against the Nazis who
simply don't take themselves all that seriously.",79,1942

the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about
his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow all turn in
first rate performances in their respective roles; Ms. Phillips has the
slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a made-for-TV movie
(twenty-five years ago), by supplying the ""sex interest"" in an otherwise
sexless film. The real star, however, is the ""California Kid""; a 1934
Ford

that'll leave the viewer panting, gasping and holding the edge of the seat
with breathless anticipation.The action scenes are spectacular, (although some of the dialog is a bit

129,5.5,7.5,"""My Cousin Vinny,"" along with the megahit ""Goodfellas,"" put Pesci on the
map. Of course, he's been in the Scorcese's previous hit ""Raging Bull,"" but
didn't get a hell of a lot of recognition at the time. Joe Pesci's
character of Vincent LaGuardia Gambini is a landmark character in comedy
history. When his New Yauker street smarts collide with Southern
hospitality--brilliant fish-out-of-water humor ensues! Of course, Pesci should've be given all the credit. Marisa Tomei, who
RIGHTFULLY won the Supporting Oscar for her excellent performance (please
don't believe that urban myth about Jack Palance calling out the wrong
name!!), is hilarious as Pesci's fiance with a foul mouth, a smart a**, the
heaviest Brooklyn accent and an incredible expertise in automobiles. This
was also the movie that made Marisa a star, and a performance I commend to
this day.What can I say? This movie has some of the most priceless bits of comedy.
One, of course, involves Pesci's pronunciation of the word ""youth"" which
sounds like ""yute."" One underrated bit is the one where Pesci first meets
his cousin's friend (Mitchell Whitfield) in the jail cell. His cousin
(Ralph Macchio) is asleep and Pesci suddenly pays the friend a visit. He
doesn't know Pesci is the lawyer, and assumes he's some guy who...wants to
make him his b**ch. The comic dialogue in that scene is so perfectly
executed and I feel it's one of the funniest in the movie. I'm not going to
give away any more of the film's slick, intelligent humor--You have to see
it for yourself!!!If you're in the mood for a smart, well-written, well-acted comedy that will
have you on the floor--look no further! ""My Cousin Vinny"" doesn't
disappoint in any of those aspects. This is a truly memorable piece of
comedy, and though it was released in 1992, I'm sure comedy lovers will pay
homage to this movie in the present day.My score: 8 (out of 10)",120,1992
130,12.5,6.3,"On the whole, this is a very good movie all round. The four main cast
members are superb, and the story is heavily character-driven, with no
ridiculous stunts and special effects present to drown the characters
out at any stage. The lean score and graceful cinematography allow the story to be told
at an ideal pace, and aren't used to lift the intensity as one would
expect with this genre because the story is good enough to take care of
this on its own. I never felt as if things were dragging or being
rushed, and things were largely unpredictable aside from the ending,
which was satisfying nonetheless.For a good vs bad theme, the story favors neither side over the other
in terms of skill and resources. So often the bad guys are made to look
like fools but this isn't the case here, which I found to be quite
refreshing. The teen romance side of things is handled better than
almost any other examples I've seen. There aren't any cringe-worthy
moments at all.In all, Mean Dreams was much better than I expected, and well worth the
time I spent watching it. If you're after a low budget thriller which
is well made, character-driven, and intelligently written, you could
settle for much worse than this one.",0,2016

they couldn't get back out. So with that, I was on my seat edge as our

fall. Without a spoiler alert, she does virtually everything in this
film you could to get killed or maimed and the writer/director finds
ways for her to fail yet survive.There's a lot of grit here, from hard parties to transactional
activities between employer and employee, and then client and counsel.

impact when first released in 1965. Meyer had taken the world by storm
with ""The Immoral Mr. Teas"" (1959), the film most often credited with
kicking off the nudie cutie craze. And he would become a household name
with the success of ""Vixen!"" (1968). But the films he made between
those two landmarks, though some of them are among his best work,
didn't attract much attention. But then John Waters, in his 1981
autobiography ""Shock Value"" wrote : ""'Faster, Pussycat! Kill!
Kill!'...is, beyond a doubt, the best movie ever made. It is possibly
better than any film that will be made in the future."" Waters dubbed
Meyer ""the Eisentein of sex films"" because his use of skillful editing
to get maximum impact out of scenes of sex and violence is reminiscent
of the methods by which the Russian director managed to powerfully
convey his political messages. Waters' championing of ""Faster,
Pussycat!"", in particular, led to it becoming a favourite on college
campus's across America.If Meyer is ""the Eisenstein of sex films"" then ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill!
Kill!"" is the ""Citizen Kane"" of trash films. I don't use the term
disparagingly. For me a trash film is a film which appeals on a
visceral rather than purely emotional level. In trash films realism is
bad style. We must always know that we are watching a movie and enjoy
it as a fantasy formed from our own base drives - from those
uncivilised aspects of our nature that we must repress to live a
civilised existence. Hence the term ""trash"" for the substance of these
films is those aspects of ourselves which must be discarded. The
violence in the trash film appeals to the knot in our stomach from
every time we've had to bite back on our anger. It's prurient sexuality
appeals to the lusts generated by everyday existence for which we may
have insufficient outlet. We don't sympathise with the characters in a
film like this, but we can identify with their actions because they
take place in an obvious fantasy world. But the trash film has another
appeal - the exhilaration that comes from the transgression of the
bounds of good taste. And its sense of humour is the kind which elicits
a belly-laugh. The anarchic spirit of the trash film has no less value
than the more rarefied pleasures and intellectual stimulation of the
art film.What makes ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" great is the way that it
takes the sex and violence of the trash film and distills them into
something more iconic than explicit. Unlike most of Meyer's films,
there is no frontal nudity or sex scenes. The violence is powerful, but
not extended or shown in gory detail. Yet Tura Satana in her tight
black jeans, half-exposed breasts practically bursting free as she eyes
up a man like a side of beef or takes him out with karate chop to the
neck, distills any amount of sex and violence into a single
unforgettable mythic figure. Similarly the vastly underrated Stuart
Lancaster is the very personification of sleazy misogyny. Add to this
the brilliant build-up of the opening monologue, Meyer's masterful
editing and Jack Moran's eminently quotable and often hilariously funny
camp dialogue and you have a trash film masterpiece that just gets
better and better the more times you watch it.",83,1965
135,19.0,3.8,"I really enjoyed this movie. While clearly made on a shoestring budget
it has a higher production value feel, shown in the filming, score &
overall sophistication. This may not be the horror movie for you if
you're looking for cheap thrills, graphic gore and simple answers, and
it's maybe one part horror to two parts psychological drama. It shines
best in the awkwardness of the relationships, delivered as excellent &
convincing performances by the actors, and makes great use of the 'lost
in the past' qualities of Amish life. It does leave some questions
unanswered but I think this is intentional, and secondary anyway to the
deeper internal conflicts between good and evil.",92,2015

stars - better than a 7 but not quite an 8, but got the 8 anyway)Going into this with no A-list actors, I wasn't expecting much but must
say, although it was a slow progressing movie (86 mins was perfect), I
still enjoyed it.The acting was actually quite good, the cinematography and location
setting was excellent as was the score. The director did a great job
putting this all together and making you feel you were right there
feeling the anxiety of the actors and the situation. There were some
parts that needed improvement, such as the opening scene with the guy
getting dragged out of the trunk - would have liked some more
background on that part, as well as more of an ending.This was no Sicario by any means, nor did it have the actors to support
it, but overall for a movie that was a little slow (and I'm not one to
sit through long dragged out movies), this one kept me anxious and
following the storyline with anticipation. The ending was also a little convoluted... who where the group of
people that shot them, and where the Border Patrol higher-ups in on
this scheme, as the report of the amount they retrieved was much less
than the actual initial find.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend Transpecos
as a Netflix & Chill type movie night. Cheers!",86,2016
137,3.0,5.7,"A good film fight depends on how the audience is experiencing it. The
majority of the fights from the Rocky series work as we want to see
Balboa win the boxing match that he's worked hard training for. The
fights from Fight Club are engaging because the film establishes that
this works as way to ease some of the tension that Edward Norton had
developed within his mundane life. Looking at a bad example, the main
battle from Batman V Superman is poor as the movie did not establish
enough of a connection with it's audience and failed to give us a good
reason for our heroes to fight. So when a movie like todays is building up to a big fight, then it has
to establish some relatable characters and justify the need to brawl.
Given that this is school based, the best example is an eighties comedy
called Three O'clock High. That one was about students getting ready
for a fight after class. It was funny and smart with how it understood
how a lot of students would react under the fear and the naive attitude
of adults. Now we have two teachers meeting after school in Fist Fight. It's the last day of high school, which is also prank day. What
operates is the high school from hell as teachers and staff are victim
to pranks that are so elaborate and insane that real teenagers might
see as too much work. English teacher Andy Campbell (played by Charlie
Day) is worried that he'll get cut as principal Richard Tyler (played
by Dean Norris) is more worried about keeping the budget low. Campbell
is also worried about his soon to be born second child and daughter who
is dealing with bullying of her own. All Campbell wants is to get
through this day without much trouble.Campbell's day is thrown into chaos by history teacher Ron Strickland
(played by Ice Cube) who is not having any lip from the students. When
a prank involving a television disrupts the class, Strickland goes
crazy with a hatchet chopping a desk in half. When the principal
demands answers, Campbell reveals that it was all Strickland, causing
the history teacher to lose his job. In response, Strickland tells
Campbell that their going to fight after school. Campbell does
everything he can to get out of it, even talking to coach Crawford
(played by Tracy Morgan) and guidance counselor Holly (played by
Jillian Bell) for advice. Of course, the fight is on.What's interesting is that the movie tries to convoy the message about
underfunded schools. It's a good message if Fist Fight wasn't so
hypocritical of itself. The main problem is that everyone in this movie
is an awful human being. I don't mean all the main characters, but
everyone! Aside that every student seems to be a serial killer, both
Charlie Day and Ice Cube are both unsympathetic and too unlikable to
want to follow for an entire movie. You know your in for a bad movie
when the running time is only and hour and a half, yet it feels like
three.What's worse is that until the fight happens in the end, your stuck
with these people for a long time. They try hard to throw every joke
they can from student pranks an F bomb or a meth joke, but very little
of them did anything for me. I mentioned before in my review for
Sausage Party that you have to offer more then shock jokes and foul
language. Fist Fight falls in that same category, but is far worse for
being a failure as a comedy and trying to say something about the
American school system.I'll give this two bloody school gym mat out of ten. Despite some
committed performances and a fight that does have some good moments, I
really cannot recommend Fist Fight. Take your milk money and go rent
Three O'clock High instead. It's the same, but funnier and smarter.
This is one fight that won't end with any winner.",91,2017
138,4.5,6.8,"Wow. Talk about a train wreck. Of course I'm speaking in reference to the
life of Tracy, the main character, not the movie itself. I give props to
the cast and crew, they all got mad skillz. Now for a more intellectual
look toward the dystopic view of adolescence and the loss of
innocence.Now that I've thoroughly confused old and young alike, here's the meat and
bones of why I think you should see this movie. The movie captures the
creation of the emotional rift between an adolescent girl and her mother.
While the rift is eventually healed, the impact on the viewer is anything
but easily forgotten about. The movie is shocking, don't assume that it
won't shock you; these kids do more (insert ANY shocking noun here, i.e.
sex, drugs, etc.) in a day than an average college student, at least a
college student like me, would SEE, much less do, in an enitire semester. Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Tracy, gives a (dare I say it about someone so
young?) Oscar-worthy performance in her portrayal of an emotionally troubled
juvenile. She captures the mood swings, the dark brooding, the joy of being
that age perfectly. If there was ever a reason for being scared of having a
child, much less a daughter, having a daughter like Evan Rachel Wood's
character would be it.Nikki Reed, the co-writer of the script, deserves notation for her breakout
performance. Her acting was very good, considering that she has never had
any experience in the field ever. Rather than detract from her performance,
her inexperience in selling her character to the audience only added to the
dark, manipulative side of her character. If she studies the art and craft
of acting, she will be a presence in Hollywood for years to
come.Holly Hunter gives another stellar performance. Her character's balance, or
lack thereof, between the enforcer of parental-rules and her desire to be
involved in her daughter's life perfectly captures the connundrum of every
parent. The climax of the film, featuring Hunter and Wood, reminds the
viewer of the intensity that raw emotion can create when you put two amazing
actresses together and set the pressure-cooker on Nuclear
Meltdown.Thirteen is a must-see if you are entering middle school, or if you have a
daughter entering middle school. Better yet, go see it with your daughter;
you will both be talking about it for a long time. I give it a

140,10.666666666666666,7.8,"Cookie cutter suspense/thriller/horror flick that isn't very
suspenseful or thrilling or scary. The only real change from the norm
with this movie is that it features a black man as the lead actor, and
early on in the movie it touches on some of the problems of interracial
dating from a black man's perspective. I found some humor in the way
that the white family (and later their white friends) interacted with
the lead character...going out of their way at times to either talk
about how they voted for Obama or loved Tiger Woods...basically doing
and saying the things that white people say to black people in an
attempt to prove they aren't racist. The movie was fairly well acted despite not having exceptionally strong
material to work with. I thought Daniel Kaluuya turned in a really
strong performance and he really saved the movie, imo. I don't recall
seeing him in anything else prior to this, but he gave an excellent
performance and I hope this serves as a spring board to bigger/better
roles. Seems very talented. My biggest problem with this movie is that I don't know what it was
trying to be. It kind of hit a little bit with the satire and humor
elements, but all in all, the movie just doesn't really have an
identity. The ""mystery"" behind everything was not well concealed and
the twists and turns you'd expect from a movie like this just never
developed. I had this movie pretty well figured out before the halfway
mark, which made for a less enjoyable second half of the movie. I'm
pretty amazed by all the rave reviews it's getting. It is a bit groundbreaking in it's own right strictly for the
cultural/social/racial aspect - as that has been largely neglected in
movies, especially this genre - but once you get passed that and just
look at the movie for what it is, I can't really give this movie
anything more than a middling grade. Not the worst movie I've ever seen
by any means, but also not really worth the price of admission either.

141,9.25,6.0,"The famous Great Wall was built to keep out the evil hordes: people
with a lot of problems, drug dealers, murderers rapists, and (I assume)
some good people. Wait a minute, wrong wall. Regardless, The Great Wall embraces a new direction currently seen in
filmmaking. Many movies, like Transformers 4, have featured Chinese
locations prominently with the hope of getting into Chinese theaters.
The rules to get into Chinese theaters are long and complex and the
rules as to how much money an American studio can make from those
theaters is even more complex. So, US-Chinese co- productions like The
Great Wall could become the rule rather than the exception.Consequently, the story behind how a movie like The Great Wall gets
produced, is way more interesting than the movie itself. The Great Wall
is movie where things happen not out of natural plot development or
character motivations, things happen because the script says they
happen.The best example of this lack of plot development is the revelation
that the creatures made it to the other side of the wall. How they
accomplish this daunting feat is neither explained nor shown to the
audience. Suddenly, a guard tells Matt Damon that it's happened and
that's that. Perhaps the creatures paid a toll?Speaking of which, the creatures and main villain of this movie are
simply put ugly green poorly rendered computer dogs. Not creepy ugly
like the Predator or Alien. Just ugly ugly. Additionally, they express
no motivation or intelligence for their machinations beyond the need to
get food for their queen. That's the limit of their complexity, this
from the main antagonists throughout the movie.I guess I could go into Willem Dafoe's role in the movie, but then I'd
quickly be doing more work on his character than the script did.
Further, Matt Damon's character has a friend (played by Pedro Pascal)
that travels with him throughout the story whose contribution is nearly
non-existent.In fact, one could streamline this script and tell the same story with
just Matt Damon's character and a selection of random guards. One could
argue that all the extra story lines and characters are red herrings.
However, that would imply that these elements at one time seem
important. They never do. The movie is nothing more than generic
throwaway monsters versus shallow throwaway heroes.Sadly enough, some good ideas are here. For instance, to signal how
they'll attack the creatures the soldier use drumbeats to unify their
action quickly. This is not only a nifty military technique, but, more
importantly, provides a good driving bass to the action and,
unfortunately, is criminally underused here. The use of color on the
Chinese soldiers is frequently beautiful. However, the way they attack
the amassing hordes from the wall swiftly ranges from very cool to very
stupid.Presumably, they could create a decent video game from this movie,
which brings us full circle to the techniques movie makers embrace to
make money.I watched trailers for this movie and although I didn't expect great
art, I did think it could be dumb fun. Well, I was half right.",103,2016

actually
true - particularly in relation to the crises just before the actual
moonwalk. But frankly, I don't care, because ""The Dish"" as a movie is a
splendid experience.Being heavily promoted as ""from the makers of 'The Castle' "" may get a few
extra punters in the door - particularly here in Australia where the
exploits of the Working Dog team are rightly well known and loved; but
those
expecting ""The Castle 2"" will be in for a surprise.But a pleasant one. This film is much more ambitious, much larger in
scope.
As is to be expected, the writing here is very sharp - a likeable group
of
characters are defined very well very quickly, the simple plot flows
smoothly, and there is a constant stream of funny (and some downright
hilarious) moments. Much of the humour is distinctly Aussie, and much of
it
arises from the culture clash between the locals and the visiting
Americans.
Yet despite this, the film does not stoop to the level of ""Ocker cliché""
which plagues several other Australian films. There is a core of simple
humanity here which makes it very engaging. It is for this reason also
that
I think the film will play very well in other countries.The cast is also very impressive, from the habitually sound Sam Neill, who
projects an immense dignity, and Patrick Warburton as the pressured NASA
official sent to oversee the operation, right down to the Mayor's son,
reeling off technical details of the spacecraft to his bemused dad. It is
a
credit to the cast, and to Rob Sitch as a director that I was rarely aware
that I was watching a film, I was simply drawn into the
experience.Those, like me, who wanted to be an Astronaut when they were little, and
maintained an interest in the space program, will enjoy seeing the famous
footage again in a new light. Those looking for a comedy will find many
laughs herein. Those curious to understand the nature of being Australian
will find some clues. And those just looking for a film to make them feel
good could do much much worse. In short, ""The Dish"" is one of those rare
movies which will appeal to pretty much everyone. I can't really think of
any serious criticisms, and left the cinema feeling... well, ""nice"". I
have
no doubt it will play well in Australia, but I also hope it does well
overseas too, in the US and elsewhere. I'd recommend it to everyone I
know,

just so incredibly dumb and tedious!I could have turned it off, but I kind of have a thing where I want to
see where everything goes and how things end. So, with one eye on my
phone and another on the screen, I continued to watch. I have to admit that there is a point where it gets better, but the
better part of it is short-lived. I won't say too much in order to not
spoil it for others, but the acting was pretty okay, and the actors
were nice to look at. There was a lot of what I thought was unnecessary
sex (and no, I'm not a prude) but since the cast consisted of
good-looking people, it fit, although you could tell it was unnecessary
filler for lack of a strong enough story and good lines.About 3/4s of the way through however, it began unraveling, and what
could have been an okay movie turned back into the very dumb movie I
had originally thought it to be.The very weak point of the story is revealed and it shifts into

being pregnant. They're pretty thorough. Not only that, she appeared to
be a good 5+ months pregnant when the mission started - absolutely no
way in hell no one would have realised (even discounting the vigorous
health checks).2. WTF did they feed the newborn baby? The mother died, and I presume
no one thought to pack baby formula for the astronauts to drink.3. They could have brought the child back when the mission was due to
return. First of all, 2/3 gravity isn't a big enough difference to even
on its own to cause irreparable damage. I'm certain they could have
helped get his body used to a higher gravity by exercising him and
making him wear weights or something. Even without all that, they could
have simply helped his body and his heart adjust to Earth's high
gravity by for example putting him in a freaking water tank, idk. There
are ways.4. He (Gardner) has instantaneous communication with earth, and access
to the internet (and presumably everything it has to offer), he's
apparently a genius, and he was indeed raised among humans - even if
they were only ""scientists"", rather than ""loving parents"" who would
teach him all about life - yet somehow half the time he's acting like a
socially retarded 5-year-old who has never seen even a picture of
horse?! Uh-huh. This whole person-from-a-different-time-or-space-is-

it's an old joke, and this time they failed massively.5. Even though he's now old he could have still done the physical
therapy I mentioned earlier. Better late than never!6. I love how in the beginning of the film they make a point to mention
that Earth's resources are pretty much depleted and all that jazz, but
then 16 years later they can afford to send a rocket to space just to
send a Martian and his father back home. You know how many resources it
takes to build a rocket and fuel it? Even if the rocket was part of a
mission that was already going there (conveniently leaving so soon
after Gardner nearly died), those seats are valuable, and there are no
spares.Alas, that's not even all of it, but those are the biggest, most

Lewis gore film, we get some cool scenes of violence. One of the better

any grief.Next we meet Tess (Ryan Simpkins), a similarly uncommunicative young
lady who initially displays all of Lucy's charm (i.e.: none)  and yet
Tess's troubles are there for a reason: for years, she has suffered
mental instability episodes throughout her life. We learn this from
scenes of her isolation, even in her fairly bustling hometown. This may
make her susceptible to Lucy's undead spirit  With so little happening
throughout the running time, and when much of that time is given to
focussing on Tess's sullen moping, there isn't much sympathy invited.
It is suggested that Tess's condition - a 'dissociative identity
disorder' - makes her susceptible to Lucy's undead presence. Her mother
Jessica, fashionably not that much older than her daughter, is wracked
with the applicable concern, but when her daughter is so cut off, so
apathetic, as far as this drama is concerned, she just becomes a pain
in the neck. With an unresponsive child possessed by a sulky
adolescent, the subtleties of the drama are fatally unengaging.And yet, amid the heart-wrenching soul-searching, Sarah's wishes that
her dead daughter Lucy needs to be 'in a better place' are somewhat
unnerving, especially as the spirit seems unwilling to leave the host
body. These scenes, and others, would have been so much more effective
if more was made of the supernatural element.Ultimately, despite what are presumably the best intentions of the cast
and crew, two women screaming 'Tess!!' every time the young woman
coughs or chokes or looks earnestly into the distance doesn't really

perfect for her role. Luke Wilson's performance was probably why I gave
it a 7 . He good but not as good as the others. I liked the music and
the location went with the story. The editing seemed to flow I've
watched some independent movies were it seemed choppy or timing between

163,11.75,5.4,"Zoë Lund stars in dual roles, her first being a wannabe star, Mary
Jane, a woman who ran out on her husband and son for a life as an
actress..her dream is snuffed out(pun intended)when she has the
misfortune of showing up at the massive art deco home of failed
director, Christopher Neville(Eric Bogosion), whose decorum has a
strange emphasis on flowers. Neville, reacting to Mary Jane's insulting
in a moment of furious anger, strangles her when she ridicules his
recent firing from a big budget Hollywood movie, after becoming upset
that he has a camera hidden behind a mirror to film them having sex.
Keefe Waterman(Brad Rijn)is the third party in this situation, Mary
Jean's husband, who had come to New York City to take her home, even if
it was against her will. Leaving MJ's dead cleaned body in Keefe's
station wagon on Coney Island, Neville has just gotten away with the
perfect murder. Even worse, Keefe is arrested for MJ's murder when
there were witnesses seeing the disgruntled husband forcing her into
the station wagon to go to her apartment to get some things. Neville
decides, after realizing he had recorded the murder on film, to shoot a
biography on MJ's life, with plans to implicate Keefe by getting him
out on bail and in the movie! Kevin O'Conner is Detective Phillip
Delroy, the cop on MJ's case, who is included as an adviser on the
film! It's a way for Neville(a clever, calculating, cold-blooded
bastard)to seduce Delroy by having him part of the ""Hollywood process""
and soon another will become enamored in the title role, a feminist
named Andrea(Zoë Lund's second role)Keefe discovers at Salvation Army.
Andrea loses her own identity as she immerses herself in the role of
MJ, having a hard time overcoming the allure of being part of this
movie. When we see Neville strangle a blackmailer with film(that tears
into the victim's throat), we know he's not playing for keeps. When
Keefe ruins the snuff footage, Neville has plans to stage the scene
again, this time Andrea's life is in danger.Another one of those great Larry Cohen oddities, I think he had Marilyn
Monroe in mind as inspiration for the roles of Andrea and Mary Jean.
It's interesting, I was thinking about actors/actresses who spend a
lifetime portraying other people, and having a hard time determining
where the character ends and real person begins. I think that is what
really spoke to me as I was watching SPECIAL EFFECTS. I think the draw
of Hollywood is what Cohen uses most in his satiric(albeit a dark
one)script for the movie. Kudos to Zoë Lund for portraying two distinct
personalities, Mary Jean, selfish and self-absorbed, yearning for
success, and willing to bed Neville in order to do so, & Andrea, a
vocal, blunt, honest woman who sees through the director's bullcrap,
often calling him out for the phony that he is(as she puts it, he's
always working a routine, never authentic in anything he does), but not
denying the thrill of being in his film. I think Cohen establishes in
the opening dialogue that Neville was destined to commit murder,
describing Zapruder as his most favorite director because he caught a
real murder on film. Cohen makes sure to incorporate the title within
his script as Neville is notorious for blowing a budget primarily on
special effects, obviously wanting to make his pictures as authentic as
film will allow. Unusual synth score and, as typical for a Cohen
production, good use of New York locations. I personally found SPECIAL
EFFECTS a fascinating film(not average at all, although the ending
where Neville finally gets his comeuppance, is kind of a cop out)with
layers, and was entranced by Zoë Lund..there's just something about her
that holds me in a trance, I'm not sure what it is about her. The final
scene, where Andrea makes a decision to ""adopt a new personality"", is
quite intriguing, I think..resisting Keefe's desire for her to be Mary
Jean, instead of who she really is, there's a subtext regarding
""playing the role"" which I found compelling.",106,1984

locale a swampy delta, probably near New Orleans. Even the inhabited
buildings look abandoned. This is an ideal place to make a horror film

your day job. They obviously see the world as all black and white.
Which is likely why they can never seem to grasp their head's around
the concept's of movies such as this.I could barely recognize Katie Cassidy in this movie. Not just because
of her makeover for her character she played, but generally did a
really good job playing it. Normally I get annoyed by her acting but
she did a fine job here. The rest of the supporting cast did well also.
It's probably a good thing they didn't have Sasha Grey in more than 1
scene. I admire that she's trying to become an actress coming from
being a porn star, but she's definitely not the strongest actress out
there.The movie starts off slow, but is just intriguing enough to maintain
your curiosity and easy you into the crazy/intensity that comes later
on. Not sure why it' only classifies this as a thriller. It should
easily considered Sci-fi as well. Especially when it steps into the
topic of unlocking people's full potential, resulting in levitation,
telekinesis, etc... The last 20 minutes or so definitely have my full
and undivided attention.I don't want to give too much away so if you have an open mind and are
a fan of anything Sci-Fi or graphic novel based, I suggest you give it
a try and it might just surprise you. If you you only see things in
black and white and can never wrap your head around certain movies
because they are just simple, real-life drama stories, then why bother.
If you can't like, understand or be open-minded for any movie you
watch. Then your review really is irrelevant. If I take anyone's advise
for a movie I might be interested in, I'd rather listen to the person
that understood what was going on.",88,2014

unlikeable....although the bad guys are the worst of the lot...in the
acting and the looks department...after a while they began to grate on
me and it became an annoyance and a distraction because i just wanted
them off my screen but it takes a while for them to be
dispatched...although when they are offed i found it immensely
gratifying and i was thankful i'd never have to see these terrible
characters ever again. When the opening 'horror' occurs we have just
been treated to a close up shot of the rape victims vagina...now this
character is wearing a skirt that is about 5-6 inches in length and has
no problem with bending fore-ward and showing the entire bowl-a-rama
her front bottom.....this confused me because it didn't help me to
sympathise with her character when she is violently raped...yes i found
it sickening and brutal but i didn't really sympathise with the girl
who readily shows her muff to anyone, regardless to whether they want
to see it or not...so it begged the question why the director chose to
have her knicker-less...to me the scene would have been more shocking
if her character had been easier to relate to....most women don't show
their muff to all and sundry....so to me i found it hard to actually
care about her character..i just wanted the scene over. Once the scene
is over the carnage commences. What carnage their is is well executed

of the scenes just didn't do anything for me...the sex=death scene

dragged her in off a street corner somewhere) and one of the 'good'
guys have sex and die during, it's not convincing and looks cheap and
naff....in fact none of the sex in this movie is believable or
sexy...it just looks like sloppy, nervous encounters between desperate
actors...and willies pop up everywhere...but they're very small...and
the women are not sexy at all and mostly look like crack
whores...except the final 'goth' type girl who seemed to be the best
out of a bad lot. Some of the other characters are badly written and
badly played...for example the drag queen...they seemed to be making
fun out the whole subject and making the least bit of effort into
making it believable. The dialogue, combined with the terrible acting
is sometimes annoying...the use of the 'f' word became grating and most
of the movie is made up of the words f**k, c**t, f*g, b*itch...it
really does become tedious after a while.....and some parts are
downright pathetic...like when the meanest guy find his dead friend's
headless body he asked ""where the f*ck is you're head?"".... This movie
is a good enough attempt but was a huge let-down...some memorable gore

169,8.0,7.2,"I realize that's not saying it's the best ever made, but it certainly marked
me so much as to regard it as my all-time fave. The movie reminisces of Elia Kazan's Dean movies, and ""The Wild One""
starring Marlon Brando. Just as those movies (and much better done, IMHO),
Rumble Fish is about violence as a consequence of uncomprehension;
loneliness; and family relations in a sordid, black and white environment.
Not even this choice is random, as its B&W filming (and somewhat deficient
sound quality) is yet another commentary on life as seen through the eyes of
its characters - and author. Every scene in this movie brings a realization, though some of the
dialogues are indeed a bit naive when seen after its time. And here I could
engage in a debate on ""naiveté"" vs. ""savvy"", and whether an innocent view of
life really means less message depth (or whether a jaded outlook really
guarantees understanding), but I digress. The point is, I'm a 27-year old
man and I still cry every time I see this movie. The first time I saw Rumble Fish, I thought I identified with the
Motorcycle boy and his alienation from the world he was put in. After a few
more times, I realized more and more that I ""was"" Rusty-James - That, to an
extent, EVERY man is a little Rusty-James; trying to live up to a hero
image, and helplessly watching as your ideal slips past your reach and lets
himself be killed, without you ever understanding anything until it's too
late... or is it? Where Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis speak to the hero we WANT to be, Matt
Dillon speaks to the MEN who want to be that hero, and leads the way out. *sigh* The astounding soundtrack, exquisite photography and perfect takes don't
hurt any, either. Buy it, rent it, whatever. See the goddamn movie. It is worth a try (and a

memoirs of a man going blind. If that sounds slightly unusual, it's
because it is. The cast lip sync the actual recorded words spoken by
John Hull and his wife who detailed his descent into the debilitating
world of visual impairment in the 1980s.The memoirs capture the pure physical and psychological turmoil
experienced by John as he experiences this loss of vision, and as he
says he battles to live in reality instead of this nostalgic world that
his brain is forcing upon him. The dreams he experiences and the way he
describes them are beautiful bittersweet torture - as it is his only
way of conjuring new images into his world, yet he wakes every morning
crestfallen, as he remembers he cannot see, and they were just dreams.
One night he dreams he can see his new child that was born after he
lost his sight. The way this scene is directed (by Peter Middleton &
James Spinney) is as magical as it is emotive.John expresses to us that he believes part of his brain is dying as a
portion of it no longer requires power to process images. He says he
feels hungry for stimulation that he just cannot obtain. He also
forgets what his wife looks like, which must be pure agony. The
frustration of being rendered effectively useless as a parent also
weighs heavily on his mind, and some points on the audio tapes you can
almost feel the depression that John must be battling.Dan Renton Skinner does an unbelievable job as the taunted John Hull.

action scene was dominated by real tough heroes like Schwarzenegger,
Stallone, Norris, Seagal and Van Damme. Unfortunately, times have
changed and we don't see many of those anymore. ""Expendables 2"" wasn't
the first time Adkins worked with his role model Van Damme. Adkins
already made some good action movies in the last decade and is best
known as Boyka in the ""Undisputed"" franchise. After the flawed ""Hard
Target 2"" it's nice to see he's back in shape again. ""Savage Dog"" is
very similar to Adkins own ""Ninja: Shadow of a Tear"" which remains one
of his better efforts. An action movie is as good as his villain is and here we have three !
All excellent actors and/or fighters like Marko Zaror (Undisputed III,
Machete Kills, Redeemer). By the way check out ""Redeemer"" if you never
saw it, great martial arts movie ! Than there's Cung Lee (Dragon Eyes).

(think of Kickboxer, Savate, Lionheart) but the last half hour is when
the real action takes place: a lot of shoot-outs, knife fights and the

180,11.0,4.5,"Seven days! A simple phrase that struck terror in our hearts oh so many
years ago. Certainly, you know I'm talking of The Ring, the horror
movie about a death delivering video tape certain to scare you to
death. Samara's tale has fallen on to the backburner for some time, but
like the cursed video, the series has resurfaced to the modern world to
once more have you cowering at your screens. Will Rings live up to the
potential? Robbie K here, once more sharing his opinions on yet another
film. Let's get started. LIKES:  Decent acting  Nice blend into the modern era  Strong story
for a horrorSummary: Okay, this movie is certainly not going to win awards for best
performance, but Rings' cast has some skill in their performances of
college kids plagued by an evil spirit. Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz and
Alex Roe are the leads of this tale, doing a great job of balancing
romance and detective work, finally a power couple who wasn't annoying.
And Johnny Galecki trades one nerd role for another, though this time
his scientific qualities had a little darker twist to the mix. Overall,
the cast gets a pat on the back for establishing some good characters
to hook on to. Yet the major things this reviewer liked involved the
story components of the movie. Rings has jumped into the modern area,
dropping the outdated VHS tapes for modern day MP4 files. It will help
bridge the generation gaps, and add a new element that the other
installments were missing. And the story was much stronger than I
anticipated. Rings has more mystery to it, trying to find the answers
to the elusive mystery of Samara's origins. Where it fits in the grand
scheme of things is a little up in the air, but at least there is some
character development and drama to spice things up. And as for the
ending, it too is a little ambiguous, providing some delightfully dark
closure, but still leaving it open for future installments. Not the
strongest finish, but also not bad. DISLIKES:  Scare Factor at A Low  Some plot elements lackluster  Not
the same RingSummary: Rings story may be on target, but the scare factor still
didn't reach the same levels that the first movie was able to achieve.
This installment resorted to jump out scare moments, mainly trying to
make you jump with sudden loud noises and hallucinations appearing from
out of nowhere. Many of these moments weren't well timed, and to be
honest many of the objects just weren't scary. Think of the first film
and how creepy everything was, the unknown always teasing you until
something sprung out of nowhere. All that was very diluted in this
installment. Even though they finally show you how she kills her
victims, the team didn't quite make it as horrifying as I thought it
would be (think ghost rider's soul stare without the flashy fire).
Rings was lacking this element, and had more of a mystery theme to it
than an actual horror. In addition, there were also some plot elements
that didn't shine as much as they wanted. For this reviewer, there is
still some questions they still haven't fully answered that you have to
draw yourself. The bottom line of the dislikes is that Rings didn't
quite hit the same level the first movie had all those years ago. The VERDICT:In conclusion, Ring is not so much a horror movie in this round, but a
mystery film about uncovering the origins of Samara. While the cast is
decent, the story is mostly thought out, and we have some answer, it
still didn't feel like the Ring series we've come to know. If you are
looking for a movie to scare the pants off of you, sorry this isn't the
film to do it. And you can probably guess, but yours truly doesn't
recommend this one for the theater and implores you to wait until it
hits home rental stands. Only people who might enjoy this one in
theater are those who care about the story element of the movie, but I
still think you can wait for home (I mean we have been waiting twelve
years for this one right?). My scores are:Drama/Horror: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0",102,2017

McConaughey (it's not about his fake teeth, weight gain or shaved head,

script is tight, smart, bitter-sweet and funny at times, because it's a
dark comedy. Well, sort of. And while it may not stay true to reality

Leckart and it's about some modern history that most of us just take
for granted. It's all about the rise of the Compaq computer company as
well as the death of IBM in the PC markethardly the stuff to excite
everyone. Most folks don't really care about the history of
computersthey just want their iPhones and PCs to work. But if you are
like me, a bit of a geek as well as a retired history teacher, then
seeing this film is a must.The film begins in 1981. Three friends are all working for a computer
industry giant at the time, Texas Instruments. The three would love to
start their own company but they aren't even sure what that company
would sell! They'd talked about opening a Mexican restaurant but
finally settled on going into the personal computer business. Little
did they know that the world would drastically change based on this
choice.Up until this time, the IBM Corporation had near sole possession of the
personal computer industry. While a few tiny companies sold computers
for home use, all the computers used by companies were IBM mainframe,
mini and microcomputers. So, the notion of this new company, Compaq,
fighting to get into the microcomputer market must have seemed
ludicrous. But somehow, these guys succeededeven if their first
'portable' computer weighed as much and was larger than a sewing
machine! How they then managed to eventually beat IBM is amazing and
it's just something you'll have to learn when you see this engaging
documentary.OkayI am a geeky history lover. But you, too, may well enjoy this film
if you give it a chanceparticularly if you are old enough to remember
these old days of computing when many folks just thought the home PC
would be a fad! The film is well made, always interesting but also
works well because most of the people involved in creating Compaq were
available to be interviewed and seemed to genuinely like talking about
these times.",77,2016
187,3.0,6.1,"Rachel Tunnard has created a delightful, cosy and funny film.A very authentic film with an exceptional script and perfectly placed
actors. The four women (Jodie Whitaker, Lorraine Ashbourne, Eileen
Davis, Rachael Deering) are wonderfully alive. Ben Goldstein is
excellent as the calming love (dis)interest who is ""definitely not
gay"". The cast also features the always exceptional Alice Lowe, and an
impressive Ozzy Myers as the adorably mischievous boy who looks the
part with his new gun bag and penis badge to offset his sheriff's star.The film is understatedly rich. This provides much of its magic. It
doesn't seem to be at all confused nor reach beyond its limits and
scope. There is a plethora of detail, character and warmth. The sickly,
drab and empty factory produced romance of modern American and English
cinema (Love Actually) is a polar opposite to this rich, natural and
awkward love story.There is a lot of love in this film. It causes the pain, aimlessness
and feeling of abandonment and loss, but provides the support, colour
and hope.Rachel Tunnard has delivered a perfect portrait of some facets of human
love.",96,2016

in prison, they will try to break out their old friend Briggs. The
sequel to the 2014 We Still Kill The Old Way is here and it was pretty
good not better than the original but still very entertaining but let's
get threw more details shall we? First of all the gang is back except
James Cosmo, the action is actually pretty nice and the overall story
is pretty entertaining to watch also the film took ideas from Oceans
Eleven and Escape Plan since a large part takes place inside a prison
and the rest of it it's about stealing. Now as far as flaws go unlike
the first one this one lacks the charm and pretty much the crazy action
and it takes a bit to start because for about 20 to 30 minutes it's
indeed very slow, now the new villain although is better than the E2
villain from the first film he gets thrown in a very weird way and he
kinda lacks character development but he is much better than the first
one. Overall this is not a masterpiece for sure but fans of 80's and

Dooley when age is clearly catching up to Jerry Lee. Jerry is forced to
partner up with Sgt. Welles(Tucci) and her dog to track down somebody
that is gunning for revenge, and putting Dooley's life in danger. The
good news is this sequel is nowhere near as bad as part three. The bad
news? It's still highly unnecessary. I'll give this movie credit where
it's due. It passed the time admirably and painlessly, something I
wasn't expecting. It still has the lazy toilet humor and it's quite
dated with an 80's feel. I love the 80's, so this type of cheese is
right up my alley. I couldn't help but chuckle at the Rocky style gags
of getting Jerry Lee & Dooley back in shape. That being said, I
couldn't shake off this feeling that this movie was phoning it in! And
to be honest, it was! There is much more action in this one than the
third. Belushi was out of shape, but not to an embarrassing degree like
he was in the third, so he's able to handle himself in mediocre
fashion, in the action scenes. At this stage? Mediocre is a compliment.
He's still way out of his element, running after baddies. I like
Belushi, but it's obvious he's nowhere near his best. He phones it in
half the time and kinda mugs his way through. He cracks some jokes,
some funny, some aren't. I kinda wish he showed a little more agony
about his dead wife. Christine Tucci is rather bland, but fits the
bill. She doesn't embarrass herself and kept me watching. Her romance
with Belushi wasn't very believable. Wade Williams is OK as the
villain. His storyline had a lot of potential, but it resorted to
clichés and took the safe route. It wasn't congruent to the tone of the

198,12.4,7.2,"I'm starting to think that I may be one of the only people who saw this film
when it was originally theatrically released! Years after that, as a
freshman in college, I was managing a video store when a woman came in
looking for the recently released `Silence of the Lambs.' She said she knew
William Petersen from childhood and told me that he was in THE first
Hannibal the Cannibal movie. Having not read the novel or seen the movie for
a while, I never related the two before that. But I specifically remembered
`Manhunter' for its creepy killer, spectacular use of Iron Butterfly, and
the strange & frightening notion (for then) of FBI profiling. These three
details alone speak volumes for the film's acting, style and writing. The
irony of forcing oneself to share the same maniacal thoughts as a killer in
order to catch them is the stuff of nightmares. Since reconnecting with
`Manhunter' back then, I've remained a constant fan of the
film.But the film suffers today in several ways. First off, any comparison to
`Silence of the Lambs' is going to come up short. `Silence' is simply a
better film  a classic of the highest caliber that will continue to sustain
itself with the passage of time. Those already acquainted with Jonathan
Demme's world will probably have a hard time accepting `Manhunter.' But
audiences should judge the film on its own merits, and recognize that unlike
`Red Dragon' it was not designed to resemble an established world of a
classic movie  which is both a curse and an advantage for both films. I
recently saw `Red Dragon,' by the way, and loved it. Walking out, I found
myself asking whether I liked it better than `Manhunter.' These comparisons
can get very silly because not only am I basing my impressions on a book,
but also a previously filmed version and a closely related `sequel.' Best
method: let each stand alone, THEN decide if either was successful. Both
films succeed for similar and different reasons. The approach of `Manhunter' is much more cold and observational than `Red
Dragon.' This style (often concerned with widely symmetrical composition),
like Kubrick's, can greatly benefit the story if used properly. I really
liked it here. The neatness and sterility of the 80s décor also works
perfectly in this format, providing a nice contrast to the horrors sometimes
contained within its walls. As for the music, it has not aged well. The synthesized stuff in the first
hour is effective at times (especially when it's just a single, sustained
note a la John Carpenter, or those bits that sound like `Blade Runner'), and
the inclusion of In-a-Gadda-da-Vida is inspired, but the electronic balladry
during Dolarhyde's romance is simply awful and detract from the scenes.
Obviously, the danger of using such modern music is that it can become
outdated and cheesy very quick. Is it just me, or does this especially seem
true of 80s music? Given Michael Mann's career, he clearly wouldn't agree. I
guess one never knows. The Tangerine Dream score for `Risky Business' or
Phillip Glass' for `Thin Blue Line,' for example, still hold up remarkably
well from this period. The performances, however, are still wonderful. Petersen (whom I've heard
didn't like the job he did) reaches just the right blend of seeming haunted,
detached, morose, and as Dolarhyde describes him, purposeful. Dennis Farina,
himself a former Chicago cop, exudes realistic authority as Jack Crawford.
Tom Noonan obtains a disturbing childlike innocence and deliberation in his
terror. And Brian Coxpoor guy, will always be compared to Anthony Hopkins.
It's unfair because he gives us a Lecter that is different, to be sure, but
intelligent in a way that, to me, is more realistic, intriguing and
ultimately frightening. Hopkins' Hannibal is so supremely horrible that he's
practically supernatural at this point, not unlike Dracula or the Wolfman. I
enjoy all of that too, but just on a different level. 8/10",120,1986

and protective leg-crossing. However, it's not testicles that make a
Man, it's responsibility and maturity. And therein lies the core of
this tale; balls, it turns out, are not balls.Barry Munday is a dim bulb, breast-obsessed horndog searching for
gratification at every possible turn. One drunken night he impregnates
a mousy, bitter woman... and completely forgets until the (celibate?)
woman's lawyer delivers a paternity demand. In the interim, an angry
father has de-testiclized him with a trumpet. The end of the Munday
lineage?The comedy is quite subtle and placed squarely on the shoulders of the
stellar cast. Supporting standouts are Jean Smart who genuinely shines
and a number of oddballs, including every member (pun intentional) of a
genital mutilation support group. Sadly, Cybil Shepherd and Malcolm
McDowell are nearly non-entities. Chloe Sevigny (the woman's sister)
has a great turn as the family favorite, stripper, female horndog
equivalent to Barry.This film belongs to Patrick Wilson, but particularly Judy Greer. In
other films her edgy sidekick has been one-note abrasive. Here, in a
tour-de-force, she juggles that same edge, bitterness, sexiness without
sex appeal and near naked vulnerability. Her performance is an eye
opener. Judy Greer fans (I was not really one of them) will rejoice.If a laugh riot filled with obvious penis jokes is your bag (pun again
intentional) you will be disappointed. The production designer clutters
the background with quite funny visual clues underscoring the issue at
hand (and again intentional). For example, hanging in the office of
Barry's boss is an antique graphic with large text reading 'Seamen'.Then there's Judy Greer's weird, mysterious, Japanese male neighbor.
Despite Ms. Greer's protestations she's a virgin (before Mr. Munday),
is the neighbor truly the father?Great comedy creates a tapestry of the human condition between the
laughs. ""Barry Munday"" delivers in spades. While not earth-shattering,
the revelations - sibling rivalry, emotional and physical abandonment,
true sadness, ego gratification, family denial at any cost,
irresponsibility - in this comedic (left-handed) spin of ""Taming of the
Shrew"" presents a beautifully crafted arc for the two main, emotionally
damaged characters.With multiple layers, smart writing, fine acting and terrific
direction, ""Barry Munday"" is a wholly satisfying comedy light on the
didactic, heavy on the weird, right on target overall.",95,2010
200,14.0,6.4,"In its only nomination in the Oscar sweepstakes for 1994 Jessica Lange
won for Best Actress in Blue Sky. After watching Blue Sky I can
certainly see why.Blue Sky is set in the years of the Kennedy Administration and it's
plot concerns a dedicated Army Major, Tommy Lee Jones and his family
consisting of wife Jessica Lange and daughters Amy Locane and Anna
Klump. Jones is more than an army officer, he's a nuclear scientist and deeply
concerned about the collateral effects of radiation on the population.
I well remember the time. President Eisenhower in his second term of
office made an unilateral executive decision to stop above ground
nuclear testing, but the Russians continued. I well remember Premier
Khrushchev in a bit of saber rattling, exploded a one hundred megaton
hydrogen bomb.Anyway President Kennedy decided at one point to resume nuclear testing
to get the Russians back to the bargaining table for a nuclear test ban
treaty. That's the background for this story and we all know that the
first thaw in the Cold War was that test ban treaty that was ratified
during the summer of 1963.Anyway Jones is looking to ban it all, writing all kinds of reports
that the army isn't taking too seriously and in fact transfers him from
California to Alabama where he's told in no uncertain terms by his
commander Powers Boothe to cool it. The military wasn't exactly
thrilled with what Kennedy was trying to do.But Jones has some pressing concerns on the domestic front. Jessica
Lange is a lusty woman with needs and her husband isn't doing right by
her. She looks like Marilyn Monroe and really does have all the army
polishing its brass for her. Including Powers Boothe who sends Jones
away so they can play.It all ends in disaster, but Jessica summons up a lot more character
than we would have first given her credit for to right the situation.
It's in those last scenes that Jessica Lange brought home Oscar.Young Chris O'Donnell is in the cast as well as Carrie Snodgrass as the
son and wife of Boothe and O'Donnell the young man about to go to West
Point finds out just what kind of rat his father really is. And Boothe
does very well as the rat.But in the last twenty minutes of the film Jessica's change in
character dominates the film and it's reason enough to check out Blue

201,7.0,6.8,"Well, I praise a lot, particularly the European animations for
preserving the 2D animation. That does not mean they lack behind in 3D
format. The recent film 'The Little Prince' was the perfect example of
a quality 3D animation outside Hollywood. Pars with Disney, Pixar
standards. Technically, as well as the story contents. But the
quantities are very less and also making it a bit expensive. So they
usually prefer producing it in the English language for the
wider/international market, keeping North America particularly in mind.
This is a French English-language film that co-produced by Canada.This is a nice film, that particularly targets little kids and mostly
the girl audience to inspire Ballerina. Cute characters and scenes, but
very familiar story. Shares lots of similarities with 'August Rush',
except the field of interest. I am not an expert or know all about
Ballet, but some of the parts involving them were turned me off. I know
the gravitation force is irrelevant in animation since they're not real
world to comply with science, but maybe I'm being an adult and knowing
that stuff might have influenced me to think that way. It reminds me
I'm really an adult, though this film should be watched as a kid
despite whatever you are. However, nothing affected me from enjoying
it.It sets in the 80s of the 19th century France. At the time when Eiffel
Tower and Statue of Libery were on the construction, a poor orphan girl
named Felicie escapes orphanage with another boy to pursue her dream to
be a ballerina. Then they arrive in Paris, and very soon they find
their separate ways to achieve the goals. Not all smooth sail,
especially for her. So she takes the opportunity that comes her way,
even after knowing it was wrong to do.❝You have something that she can only dream of: passion!❞From there, with all the complications tailing her, how far she could
go to make her dream come true. Which also includes the amount of
dedication put on her undertaking to meet the expectations of her
trainer, rivals and many others. And to show the world the interest is
not simply based on enthusiasm, but willingness to sacrifice anything
for it. Her journey from nothing to the edge of something new to define
her life is the film that briefs for just short of 90 minutes.This is not another 'Billy Elliot'. Animations are usually comedy,
fantasy and musical, but recently the adventures and science fictions
are surging. I don't remember I ever have seen an animated dance flick.
Not the classical dance, not in the modern 3D animation format. The
closest one was a decade old 'Happy Feet'. So that makes it is a unique
product and comes under a must see for all the animation fans. But the
storyline is predictable and many sequences were intentionally dragged
to be cliché. Because it works, particularly if they're aiming for the
younger generation who haven't seen many films in their lives. Only we
the grownups whine.Most of the voice-over artists are well known Americans actors which
boosted the film. The character combinations are good. It brought the
variety, especially slightly to ride off the main theme in a few
occasions. Like the boy's interest in inventing things which were other
major parts of the twist and turns in the narration. It is not a great
animation if it was from Hollywood, but coming from France and the
theme it focused on, the effort must be appreciated. Overall a much
better film than what the average reviews and ratings around the
internet says. It is a ballet film means not those who love it should
watch it, but those target audience should not miss it. That means
generally worth a watch, but not for everyone.7/10",89,2016

was lured in by the promise of the movie cover/poster. Especially
because it did seem rather interesting, sort of a mixture between
something demonic and zombiesque.First of all, it was an uphill struggle to actually sit through the
entire movie, because it was a massively generic storyline, which
offered very little in terms of entertainment value, and even less so
in originality. Furthermore, the storyline was horribly predictable, to
the point of where you just shake your head well ahead of things
actually happening.But for a horror movie, then ""Day of Reckoning"" was scarily devoid of
anything even remotely scary. And it would have served the movie well
if they had opted to go for a proper storyline that could have
bolstered the fact that this was intended to be a horror movie.Furthermore, as a horror movie it is essential to have proper practical
effects and/or CGI. Alas, it can be said in all honesty that this is
something that ""Day of Reckoning"" didn't have. And it was showing
blatantly on the screen, because the CGI was laughable at best, and it
was super poorly animated to the point of being an eyesore.I can't recall any of the acting performances in the movie, so it is
safe to say the cast weren't particularly memorable. I am sure that
they did the best they could given the severe restrictions they had

but John Lee Hancock's film is imbedded with both an energy and pace
that elevates it above the usual bio-fair and with another awards
worthy turn from Michael Keaton as its centrepiece, this enthralling
slice of history is a fabulously entertaining ride tinged in nostalgic
1950's vibes and garnished with a quick- smart script from The Wrestler
screenwriter Robert D. Siegel. Capturing the time, place and allurement of this mankind changing
business model, The Founder does a great job of transporting us back in
time as we ride alongside struggling salesman Ray Kroc, whose eyes are
opened when he comes across the McDonald brothers, whose business model
of ""fast food"" finally gives Ray the chance his so longed for all his
life, to make a buck and then some. Keaton's performance as Kroc is quite the feat. His a genuinely cold
and calculated character but as the film begins we are happy to see him
put in the hard yards as his franchise model of stores takes off but as
the brand grows so does Kroc's ego and Keaton's performance morphs
naturally as it does in fascinating and unexpected ways.Come the films later stages, the real feat of Keaton's turn comes into
the spotlight and what we're left with is a layered character brought
to life by the performer, whether it's in comical situations or
brutally raw moments shared with lawyers, Keaton is on fire here and
while his ably supported by the likes of Nick Offerman and John Carroll
Lynch as the unfortunate McDonald brothers Dick and Mac, The Founder is
founded off the back of Keaton's turn and whilst unlikely that this
film will find itself in to many awards categories, Keaton is looming
as a key player in the upcoming awards season.The Founder is one of those rare biopics that grabs you from the get-go
and doesn't let up. A well shot, scored and acted studio film that tells a story worth
telling (plus one of the best advertisements McDonald's has never paid
for), The Founder offers a fascinating insight into the beginnings of
the McDonald's brand that also gives us an equally fascinating real
life figure and another chance for the career revival of Michael Keaton
to continue on its merry way. 4 milkshake sachets out of 5",0,2016

nothing but more annoyance, and it makes little to no sense. I get that

great soundtrack pulls a story along while somehow effortlessly
blending into the background. The right one can help define a movie; a
terrible one can ruin an otherwise decent film.Traceroute relies heavily on its amazing soundtrack to convey the mood

216,3.5,5.2,"Truth be told, I hated this movie on first viewing many years ago and,
in fact, I only just now purchased the utterly bare-bones Fox DVD for
three reasons: the disc is now out-of-print; I found it very cheaply
(surprisingly) at a local retailer; and, most importantly perhaps, I
was prepared to give it another chance thanks to my ongoing (and very
rewarding) Losey-thon.To say that Joseph Losey was a strange choice to helm this picture
would be a massive understatement. In his previous films, very rarely
(if at all) had he shown that he had any sense of humor, much less the
kind of campy, knowing and irreverent one essential for successful
comic strip adaptations. As it happens, the film was not well-received
and both leads - Monica Vitti (who apparently phoned Michelangelo
Antonioni everyday during the shoot) and Terence Stamp - were unhappy
making it; there are those who even go so far as to consider it not
just Losey's nadir but quite simply one of the worst films ever made!
Well, based on that first TV viewing of it, I probably would have
endorsed such sentiments myself... However, my re-acquaintance with it proved something of a minor
revelation: while still as uneven as I recalled, I couldn't now deny
that there were some delightful elements which, on the whole, made the
film palatable and, at times, even endearing: Evan Jones' script was
occasionally quite witty, Losey's own trademark odd compositions
(usually so overpowering in his melodramas) suited the ""anything goes""
mood of the material, Jack Hildyard's glossy cinematography of
attractive Mediterranean locations, outrageous outfits and groovy
production design was top-notch and Losey's frequent composer Johnny
Dankworth provided an infectious score.And what about that cast? Monica Vitti (who would have guessed that she
could ever be as attractive and sexy as this judging by her work for
Antonioni?), Terence Stamp (gleefully throwing knives, bedding women
and engaging in a charming, impromptu singing duet with Vitti while
driving up a mountaintop and reprising it for the action-packed
finale), Dirk Bogarde (ironically named Gabriel, he was never campier -
or gayer - than as the silver-wigged, self-proclaimed ""villain of the
piece""), Michael Craig (as Vitti's ex-lover and pursuing British
agent), Harry Andrews (as a top British Secret Service official firing
away bullets from his umbrella), Alexander Knox (as a bumbling British
MP forever mispronouncing names and giving out the wrong information),
Clive Revill (for no apparent reason in a dual role: as Bogarde's
right-hand man who keeps the accounts even on the field of battle and
as Vitti's ""father"", an Arabian Sheik!), Rossella Falk (as the lethal
Miss. Fothergill, Bogarde's manly assistant, who keeps a regiment of
mostly aging men in shape through arduous physical exercise), Saro Urzi
(as a lowly, opera-singing henchman of Bogarde's), Tina Aumont (as an
ill-fated conquest/informer of Stamp's) and real-life magician Silvan
(as a duplicitous circus performer).Ultimately, while the plot is too convoluted to follow at times and the
film itself may not be in the same league as Mario Bava's DANGER:
DIABOLIK (1968) or even Roger Vadim's BARBARELLA (1968), it's certainly
an engaging spy spoof and far better than its reputation suggests.",119,1966

three girls that would be room mates in a gorgeous New York apartment.

attract a man with enough money to keep them in a style they were not

flighty Loco. It's clear that the only one with a head on her shoulders

of them end up with guys that are just making a living, and in a

she only thought he was a working class stiff!The film, although light, it's still fun to watch. Lauren Bacall is the
one that fares better in the film, not only does she get the prize
package, but she gives an intelligent account of her elegant and
sophisticated Schatze. Betty Grable doesn't have much to do, and a
bespectacled Marilyn Monroe, does a lot with her character.William Powell makes a great appearance as the older man in Schatze's
life. He still was showing his charm as the Texas man with enough sense

221,10.333333333333334,4.5,"It's hard to know where to begin to review this movie. At first glance it's
harmless enough, but there was a lot about it that annoyed me. So rather
than waste a lot of time analysing the merits (or lack thereof) of this film
I'll be flippant with the following comments:Things this movie taught me:1. Young race car drivers are, apparently, so immature as to think that a
couple of drinks with a pretty girl means that she wants to have their
babies and are willing to get into fisticuffs to protect their (entirely
imagined) relationship.2. If a driver is injured he doesn't need to see a trained physician to
certify him race fit. All he needs to do is hop up and down on a busted
ankle for the gratification of his sado-masochistic, wheelchair-bound
boss.3. If you're a naughty race-car driver you can drive your 200mph, non-street
legal Indycar on public highways and the only consequence of this
life-endangering stunt will be a small fine.4. It is also perfectly acceptable to spin your race car 180 degrees and
drive the wrong way around the race track, endangering other drivers, so
long as you're doing it to save a friend from a horrible (but well deserved)
flaming death.5. Wives, girlfriends and brothers of race drivers (or just about anyone who
knows them) can not only stand in the team control booth in a self-important
manner, but also give orders to the drivers as if they were the team
boss.6. Tyres that come off cars in accidents can fly hundreds of feet into the
air, go over the safety fence, and fall amongst the crowd. But don't worry.
So long as you aren't hit when it lands you are safe. Rubber tyres
apparently don't bounce at all when hitting concrete bleachers.All in all then, this movie is less than impressive. On a scale of 1 to
rancid this film gets a solid 4 and a half lard blocks (most of the lard was
on Burt Reynolds - will he never give up?)Not worth the effort.",116,2001
222,7.5,4.1,"No doubt the reason for a brand of whey protein a power drink are
thanked in the credits to ""The Horde"" is because they helped keep its
multi-functioning star Paul Logan -- who also wrote, produced and did
fight choreography -- shredded and pumped. Logan's big biceps and lean,
mean torso are the main attraction of this turkey, and a few more
shirtless scenes would have been welcome. There's not much else to look
at or appreciate.Logan plays a SEAL who accompanies his fiancé, the world's worst nature
photography teacher at some kind of probably for-profit rip- off
college, on an ""extra-credit"" class camping trip. She has great advice
like ""try different settings"" and ""experiment,"" and inspirational
pitches like ""there's beauty everywhere."" Her remedial students aren't
terribly interested in photography and seem barely able to hold a
camera -- one could be forgiven for thinking the film's title refers to
them instead of the group of inbreds who kill, kidnap and torture them
in the woods, until of course the muscular Logan snaps into action. The
students are all either one thing -- the spoiled rich kid is just a
spoiled rich kid, the horny couple is horny all the time -- or
nondescript. Logan the screenwriter hasn't mastered creating characters
that are remotely lifelike, even his own is one-dimensional. That's
probably why they cast terrible actors -- why waste the money on good
actors when you aren't giving them anything to play?This is a combination trip-to-the-woods horror film and
""Rambo""/""Missing in Action"" style military action film. I guess we are
too far removed from Vietnam for Logan to be re-fighting that war, so
instead he picks off mutants of the horde the way Chuck Norris used to
pick off Viet-Cong. Unfortunately, the mutants are about as
uninteresting and uninspired as the hapless soldiers were, which is a
problem for the horror-film part of the story. Costas Mandylor does a
good job as the horde's opportunistic ring-leader, and Matthew Willig
looks suitably imposing as his main henchman, but isn't given enough to
do. Considering how much build-up there is to the fight between Logan
and Willig, it is really disappointing that it didn't turn out better.
Logan the fight choreographer is fine if not innovative, and Logan the
actor is good at action, but director Jared Cohn doesn't have a knack
for shooting action sequences in a dynamic way, at least not on this
film's obviously limited budget. There is less of a sense of place (it
isn't set anywhere specific) or realism than in ultra-low-budget films
like ""Deadly Prey"" (to which this owes a debt). They are about as deep
in the woods as your average company picnic, yet somehow this mass of
mutants has lived there for decades unnoticed by the people of Topanga,
where this was filmed, or the staff of the Burger King that is probably
10 minutes away from the location shoots.One oddity: Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson, for my money the least interesting
action star of the 1990s, has an entirely pointless cameo. I guess they
couldn't get Norris.",88,2016

expectations at all or thinking it might be decent, and the film turns
out to not only be good, but blows you away by how amazing it ends up
being? That's LION, and if you've been watching films for several years
like me thinking you've seen everything committed to cinema, it's a
fantastic feeling to be proved wrong.Let me explain to you exactly what I experienced while watching LION:
Almost half of the film is in Hindi, which lends incredible
authenticity to the story, not that BS where they have actors in which
English is their second language speak English for the sake of sparing
the American audience from reading subtitles (I'm looking at you,
MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and every other Hollywood movie ever made). In
fact, the entire first act takes place in India, where about 40 minutes
of the film rides on the shoulders of a first time child actor  played
by the wonderful Sunny Pawar  and it's one of the best first acts I've
seen in years. Think of it like the silent first act of Wall-E; it
feels like it can be its own film, yet the filmmakers do a great job
connecting the story once Dev Patel comes on screen.On top of that, the filmmaking is impressive. The script is fantastic,
the cinematography is lush, the soundtrack complements the film really
nicely, and the pacing is on point where it rarely feels like it's
dragging, despite the story taking place over the course of 25 years.
Every actor in here is also terrific in their roles. As stated earlier,
Sunny Pawar makes a compelling lead for the first third of the film. If
Oscars were given to kid actors, he would have a damn good chance at
winning one. For the last two thirds, Dev Patel more than carries the
rest of the film, giving an emotionally naked performance worthy enough
to top his role in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE. Finally, Rooney Mara, Nicole
Kidman, and David Wenham are ace, despite all of them having limited
screen time.In a time where diversity is being talked about more in the film
industry, LION makes a compelling case for having diversity in
storytelling. It's not about a guy meeting his girlfriend's parents for
the first time. It's not about a group of friends going in a cabin in
the woods. It's not even about a guy/girl struggling with the death of
his/her father/mother/son/daughter/dog. No, LION is a personal story
unique to South Asians growing up in India, and it's refreshing and
easily one of the best films the year has to offer. Don't dismiss this
as yet another Oscar bait movie put out by the Weinstein Company  it
probably is one. But the film is much more than that. With a distinct
vision from director Garth Davis, LION offers an enthralling story that
deserves to be seen by everyone.",118,2016

the actors (specially James Franco) might look right into the camera

pranked!"". Well, at least that would have been original and more in
line with what I would expect from Franco, although I would feel like
an idiot. But no. I don't think there must have been any reveal of the

press about it even coming from the studio as writing it off as a loss

ages ago. I thought the concept was a bit crazy, but it did seem like
fun. After reading that Paramount was already writing it down as a loss,
pretty much told me the movie must not be that good. I didn't want to
not take my kids just because of that. Cut to today. We saw the fist showing this morning. I have to say the
movie was a lot of fun. It called back to films from the 80's when I
was a little film-goer. Director Chris Wedge really made a fun film
that has monsters and trucks, it truly lived up to it's title. I feel
like he (the director) was really pulling from films like the
Explorers, Flight of the Navigator, and a bit of Gremlins. Funny,
action packed and not long for the sake of being long like so many
movies today. It told a cute story and let us on our way. About halfway through the movie, I realized why I was enjoying it. It
was not something from another property, no comic book characters, it
wasn't a sequel. It was something to get wrapped up in and enjoy. I just wanted to say that we really enjoyed it and I hope more people
give it a chance. It's not going to solve the world's problems, but
it's certainly going to entertain you. First thing my 11- year-old said

there is a better admission of how fun it was. Very fun!",104,2016

the only thing that kept my interested throughout. Not a new idea by
any means, but the psychological aspect of the movie kept me
entertained. The directing was good. Some shots were pretty cool and
some jump scares were actually clever. Depending on how you look at it,
one of the jump scares was either a rip off or was inspired by a James
Wan jump scare. The movie had the potential to be good and they just
dropped the ball. Some people have mentioned how the shot gun deaths
were one of the reasons it was a ""bad"" movie. These people are over
dramatic. That scene, while head scratching is not going to ruin the

defenses of the Western alliance. It isn't too long after, however, that
the Russians announce that they too have built a similar computer for those
same purposes on their side--Guardian. And when the two machines begin
sharing information at a speed nobody can believe, an attempt is made to
disable them.This unfortunately just raises the machines' ire; and in retaliation, they
launch their weapons at each other's home nations. The result is a chilling
scenario that is potentially becoming all too real these

reasons. One is that its cast wasn't exactly well known. Another reason is
that its ending isn't exactly a happy one. Still a third reason is that
Universal had trouble trying to promote it in the wake of the huge success
of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The latter reason is obvious:
Colossus and Guardian, like HAL in the Kubrick movie, become central
characters here. The difference here is that while HAL malfunctions due to
a programming conflict, Colossus and Guardian remain all too stable,
convinced beyond a doubt that they know how to protect Mankind better than
Man himself. As the computers point out: ""One inevitable rule is that
Mankind is his own worst enemy.""Joseph Sargent's direction is efficient, and the special effects work of

of action and a bit of teenage angst and romance. If you love 80's

232,12.5,5.2,"Vengeance: A Love Story is based on the book Rape: A Love Story by
Joyce Carol Oates, and it makes a difference. Cage plays John Dromoor 
a Niagara Falls hero cop and Purple-Heart-awarded Desert Storm veteran,
who takes a personal interest in a case when a young single mother is
gang-raped. While the story doesn't look quite original and the
vigilante cop theme isn't even an strange role for Cage, this movie is
not just another run-of-the-mill vigilante movie. True, it focuses more
on the vigilante part than the book (probably the reason for the change
in titles), but this is a story about rape all the same, not vengeance.As such, it's darker, slower but also better compared to similar
movies. The story is well put together, though the aftermath and the
effects of the lives of Teena and Bethie could have been a little more
fleshed out, and similarly some of the other main characters, notably
the judge and Don Johnson's lawyer character. The acting is good. Cage is good, his usual, but slower, a bit more
withdrawn. Don Johnson's performance as an unscrupulous lawyer oozes
slime (good role-casting) and Talitha Bateman puts on a good
performance as the daughter. Sadly, the final third falls quite flat,
and I blame mostly the title. If you make a movie about vengeance, than
put a bit more effort in it. While more realistic than Cage's usual
wise- cracking one-liners, the movie builds up to a momentum that never
really arrives, as he coldly and efficiently disposes of the perps. But
overall, this is a decent movie, just don't expect a blood soaked,
bullet-riddled vigilante movie.",99,2017

horror I was sceptic. I mean, he's a mean killing machine and I don't
see him in a horror or it must be as the bad guy and that isn't the
fact. Of course Dolph isn't that young anymore so using his muscles
wasn't going to be the case.But with Klebe in it who I met at a convention I gave it a try. And
once the flick was over I was happy that I saw it. I admit, some are
right, the script isn't top notch and you have seen it all before but
due the fact that there is enough action from the beginning until the
end makes it worth seeing. But not only that, the effects used are
really above mediocre so it's on the edge of gore. The title says it all, just don't kill it and after the first 10
minutes you will know why. Just a no- brainer that I guess old school

laid out neatly for our viewing pleasure. It shone a spotlight on a
part of history with which I wasn't familiar. And, most importantly, it
made me want to learn more about Katherine Goble Johnson, Mary Jackson,
and Dorothy Vaughan. What a shame the screenwriters felt they had to
preach at me about racism rather than just tell the true story of these
amazing and talented women. They weren't amazing and talented ""in
spite"" of being black or ""in spite"" of being women, they were just
amazing and talented in their own right. One day, perhaps, Hollywood
will get a clue and give audiences credit for having a brain.Much of the atmosphere of racism in the movie did not ring true for me.
In many cases it didn't even make sense, so I looked into it. The first
question I had for the internet was ""Did Katherine Goble have to run
half a mile to use a bathroom on the NASA complex?"" The answer is no.
For more info on the conditions and life of Katherine Johnson check out
the interview with her here: https://youtu.be/r8gJqKyIGhE. In
particular check out 11:49 where she says she ""didn't feel
segregation"". Everyone was working. The job was important and they
weren't going to jeopardize the mission with foolish racist antics. She
was part of a team. I would've liked to have heard so much more about
Katherine and her mind and work, less about the social issues of the
1960s! I understand screenwriters have to condense a large amount of
information into a couple of hours but the ham-handed and, let's be
honest, false representation of racism at NASA and the treatment of
these women was a repeated and unwelcome intrusion into what should
have been a very interesting and educational movie about such
remarkable women. For example: I strongly suspect Katherine Goble
never, ever would have been so unprofessional as to scream at her boss
and co-workers like she does in what Hollywood probably sees as a
""cathartic"" scene. It was completely out of character and a distraction
from what should have been the real story, that of Katherine's
accomplishments. Goble was a conscientious and intelligent woman who
would've never done such a thing which, to my way of thinking, says a
lot more about her than this silly, manufactured scene. But I don't want to run the risk of being just as ham-handed in my
review and I'll leave my criticism at that. I'll only add, don't let
the prospect of being bludgeoned by an anti-racism message keep you
from going to see Hidden Figures.",127,2016

thinking foreigners must think Americans are bullying idiots if they
have movies like this and our current politics to go by.This is a ""Why Did I Bother"" film. First thought is who choose to take a civilian on a covert mission?
Would they have had to kill anyway because of what he's seen and heard
while down there? Otherwise it's not likely to be found if no one saw
it go down in the first place and if they had, they would have salvaged
it before America came in to save the day.Also, their is two likable character in the movie of four people and of
course they both die just because of film directors budget cuts or a

from any guilt. Look this witch has every reason to feel guilt for all
her bad decision, starting with lying to a civilian and using them. All
I could think in the end was good, I hope she suffers and die slowly.I guess you can see by my review, I did not like this film and it
wasn't the actors. The actors did fine with what they were working
with. No, there was just not enough debt of importance written into the
situation to make it worth dying for. So you're thinking, just go back

have lied to them about how great his submarine is to get there money,
like the Captain in JAWS and the Captain in ANACONDA and they get on it
and find out it's a lemon and proceed with the story. But this is a
very honest man, he explains several time how his ship is old and has
to be treated so gently they couldn't even wear their boots in it.It would have given her a reason to be make bad judgment calls, as it

It's an interesting love story, based on real events. David Oyelowo
plays Prince Seretse Khama, a young African man studying law in London.
Rosamund Pike plays Ruth Williams, an intelligent, fun-loving civil
servant. They fall in love, and we know that their marriage will be a
difficult one, because of prejudice both in England and in Africa.What we don't know is that their marriage has implications far beyond
each of them. In 1947, South Africa was gearing up for its apartheid
program. Bechuanaland was a British protectorate, and Seretse Khama was
its rightful prince. However, South Africa borders Bechuanaland, and
the South African government refused to tolerate a mixed race couple in
a neighboring protectorate. That meant that not only did Seretse and Ruth face prejudice from the
people around them, but they were pawns in an international standoff in
which Great Britain was willing to sacrifice them to appease South
Africa. What happened next became the plot of the movie.David Oyelowo is a superb actor. So is Rosamund Pike. Ms. Pike has 42
movie credits, but I believe the only other film in which I saw her was
Pride and Prejudice (2005), in which she portrayed Jane Bennet. I
reviewed that movie for IMDb, and wrote that her performance was
""luminous.""Director Asante is skillful, and the acting and cinematography are
wonderful. We saw the movie at the excellent Little Theatre in
Rochester, NY. It won't work quite as well on the small screen, because

special effects ridiculous and extremely cheap. The actors are

reacting to the theme of the movie and not being objective about the
film itself. I rented the flick, without knowing anything about the
film or who directed it. I knew of the story of course, but the cast
was good, and it looked interesting so I rented it. My opinion was cast
blindly and honestly. I only looked up the film later to see the
details.The movie plays exactly like a made-for-TV movie. It follows the
formula to a tee. Peter Berg has done a lot of TV work so it makes
sense. Virtually the whole movie was done with hand-held cameras which ensures
a jittery constantly moving picture with the exception of the countless
aerial shots of Boston. That's really lazy.. The music is a perfect
blueprint for the music that is played on TV documentary to
unnecessarily boost drama. Again Berg has done a lot of documentaries,
so again it makes sense. There is one preachy scene with Wahlberg on the tailgate of a truck
that actually made me roll my eyes.. I thought really? Can it be more
contrived? John Goodman's character didn't really have anything to do.. J.K. Simmons character is aloof and mostly uninterested and has one of
the more ridiculous scenes in the movie. Michelle Monaghan really didn't have a part either. The performances were good, and I love these actors. But there is some
big talent wasted on parts that anyone could have played and we
wouldn't have noticed.The movie pays tribute to law enforcement, but until the end, they are
made to look pretty incompetent and at times, witless. I couldn't

this one.I like comedies but finding a good one lately has been a challenge.
Been disappointed many times with trailers that seem promising only to
find out that those scenes are the best the entire movie has to offer.
There have also recently been a bunch of comedies relying on the

critical success only to crash and burn upon release. This one is a
rare exception. Congratulations to the team for getting it just right!
James' Laird was a delicate balance. Annoying yet sweet, sometimes
offensive but without being repulsive. Bryan's Ned fits the stereotype

245,6.0,7.2,"To this day, Martin Scorsese remains my all-time favourite director, a
man whose approach to cinema completely differs to others in Hollywood,
his appreciation towards cinema as an art form is his finest quality in
what makes him arguably the greatest film director around. With
'Silence' promoted as Scorsese's 20-year passion project, it was a film
I couldn't resist seeing, the legend back behind the camera focusing on
a subject not fully studied in cinema, a subject that's mostly
misunderstood.I want to start with my conclusion and go from there. 'Silence' won't
be everybody's film, the same way other ambitious films like 'The
Revenant' or 'The Tree of Life' weren't, however despite my respect to
Scorsese's mastery and level of detail, in my own honest opinion I
believe this film fell short due to the lack of insight into it's main
theme and thus instead transformed into a slow and somewhat dreary tale
that arguably didn't need it's near 3-hour running time to tell its
tale.Now don't get me wrong, in regards to the film's craft it is a
masterpiece, the cinematography is raw and epic, the direction from
Scorsese is phenomenal and the set design is gorgeous. Accompanying
this are a series of fine performances, most notably from Andrew
Garfield who should receive monumental praise for his role, I haven't
seen such a visceral performance in years, the raw emotion is uncanny.
But unfortunately the technicalities and craft can't cover up the flaws
that lie in the running time and the tediously slow plot that didn't
want to end.If there's anything I can leave you with from this review to help you
decide as to whether it's a worthy watch or not, let me just say this:
'Silence' isn't a piece of entertainment, it's instead an experience;
and whilst a technically masterful one at that, many audience members
may find themselves slowly drifting off to sleep - as my neighbour in
the cinema did. It isn't really a case of liking it or disliking it,
it's more a case of the adventure, and despite my partial
disappointment with it, the adventure was more than worthy enough for
the viewing. Scorsese is still an exquisite auteur, flaws or not.",161,2016

247,19.0,5.2,"As a die-hard horror fan, a fan of Demonic Possession films, and a fan
of great acting, I immediately wrote off this movie as being another
Hollywood cash grab. Blumhouse is the worst thing to happen to horror
since Rob Zombie started making movies, so seeing as this is another
bullet to add to their arsenal in murdering the horror genre, I was
weary about watching it. Couple that with the film not having any
marketing up until a few weeks before it was released, and all of the
signs pointed to a very half-a$$ed film to join the ranks of all of the
other failed horror films of the last 10 years. After watching it,
however, I am very glad to have been proved wrong. Incarnate ended up
being original, entertaining, and the acting was really top notch,
especially that of the three leads.The problem I have with Possession films is that they rarely deviate
from the formula; girl is possessed. Family calls priest. Priest needs
okay from Vatican. Priest battles demon. One of more people die. The
end. That has been the premise of every possession film of the last few
years. Surprisingly, this movie goes completely left field, not
adhering to any of the clichés that make the genre so deathly stagnant.
The demon is now a ""spirit parasite"", the girl is replaced by a boy,
there is no Catholic priest in sight, and the people who die actually
deserve it this time. The movie does so many things right that it is
really easy to overlook the things is gets wrong, and everything from
the special effects to the script is written with an actual
appreciation of what makes these movies entertaining in the first
place. Sure, some parts are cheesy and straight out of the horror
handbook, but when they are handled this well, does anyone really care?
It's much better than the abominations we have gotten in the past, like
The Last Exorcism or The Vatican Tapes.Overall, if you like Possession films, good acting, and movies that are
not made for children and teenagers, give this film a shot. You just
might like what you see. I was thoroughly impressed by this, and

recapture that Hangover like tone, Blades of Glory directors Josh
Gordon and Will Speck fail to ignite the spirit of Xmas with this
comedy caper that brings the festive vibe, but fails to bring the
laughs.Like receiving a lump of coal in your Xmas stocking, Party offers up an
interesting proposition but delivers nothing but disappointment, as a
talented cast are laboured with material that should've been left in
Santa's screen writing workshop as the appealing idea of a wild office

totally unappealing story of a struggling company trying to win a big
contract, with added bi-polar pimps, sister/brother in-fighting and
misuses of the office 3-D printer instead taking over.It's like you're constantly waiting for the true laughs to kick in as a
rather labour intensive lead up to the party hitting full swing seems

taken away on a consistent basis to revert back to one of the films
countless other side stories, it's almost as if Gordon and Speck didn't
trust their core concept enough and in the end failed to even unlock
any of its potential to be a festive themed riot.Making matters worse for the film's tired scripting and plotting is a
collection of equally tired performances from a well renowned cast.Lead by the ever the same Jason Bateman (looking and acting like he
couldn't care less), Party wastes the comedic talents of T.J Miller
(who seems better suited to cameo like turns rather than high screen
time), Jennifer Anniston, Rob Cordry and worst of all Kate McKinnon
while Olivia Munn just feels out of place in the whole wild night. The
cast clearly had chances to improvise a large portion of the films
dialogue and situations but barely any of the films payoffs actually
work and at the end of the day most of the material here is below the
performers talents.Looking to strike that cord between festive joy and raunchy comedy
gold, Office Christmas Party ends up failing to find a winning balance
in either denominator and with a collection of recycled jokes and
confused stars, this is the worst kind of party where no one seems to
be having fun other than the ones that organised the whole shebang.½ a Kia out of 5",105,2016
252,5.0,6.4,"Live By Night tells the story of gangster Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck) as
he rises, falls then rises again through the criminal underworlds of
Boston and Miami. Chronicling his life throughout the prohibition era
in America, Joe becomes involved in the most nefarious of situations.
He survives a bank heist gone wrong in which a police officers winds up
dead, he survives a long stint in prison caused by the betrayal of his
femme fatale Emma (Sienne Miller), he goes through so much in the film
that you start to wonder less about what is going to happen than as to
why it is happening. This is a film that feels incomplete, rushed and
all together shallow. Ben Affleck, who has given us some pretty
incredible films up until now, shows his weaknesses as a screenwriter
but continues to give us more than enough to chew when it comes to his
direction.While I did want more out of this film, there is no denying that
Affleck can most certainly stage some breathtaking action sequences. He
knows when to get close, he knows what to show and when to show it.
Live By Night is no exception to that standard in regards to how
everything is shown. Some major highlights of the film include a
vicious car chase through a country back road, copious amounts of
bloody shootouts and brutal fights throughout yet we feel disengaged by
what is going on. We don't know enough about anyone in the film outside
of Joe to be connected to them, let alone feel bad when someone dies.
To be quite honest, the film is 128 minutes and has about 100
characters in it...none of which you end up caring about. This comes
down on the shoulders of Affleck as a screenwriter. In many ways, the
film plays out like a highlight reel to a HBO mini-series such as
Boardwalk Empire. It never really lets us simmer in slow burn human
drama and instead gives us an action packed gangster film that is more
on the level of Gangster Squad than White Heat. If there is one thing that I've grown to expect going into a Ben
Affleck film, it is that I'm bound to be blown away by the cast if all
else fails. While the performances in this film are good, some of them
even excellent, it really doesn't translate well when you just don't
care about them. Ironically, in a film that is geared towards male
characters and dominated by such, the women in this film give
tremendous performances. Sienna Miller and Zoe Saldana stand out as two
performances that were truly powerhouse even if their screen time
collectively added up to maybe twenty minutes all together.Then there is Chris Messina, who was a bit hard to judge here,
considering he is playing a character from the 1930s underworld, but it
was extremely hard to take him seriously during times when you wanted
nothing more than to be able to take him seriously. At first, I figured
he was the comic relief but then I was left waiting for him to drop the
act and be serious for a moment. While I know Messina is a phenomenal
actor, I just could not take him seriously in this role. Unfortunately,
I thought he was too over the top. No matter what my thoughts on
Messina were, he still did not compare to how I felt about Ben
Affleck's performance as Joe.While I am a big fan of Ben Affleck, I was severely let down by his
performance in this film. I've read about the differences between the
film and the novel regarding the age and honestly, I don't really care
about that. The film is the film and the book is the book. That isn't
my issue here. My issue is how wooden Affleck went to portray Joe.
There was nothing new, nothing deep about this character which is
pretty disappointing considering both The Town and Gone Baby Gone had
tremendous lead characters that made us care about what happens to
them. Unfortunately, this isn't the case here. This film does very
little to make us care about any character, let alone our lead. Many
will argue that watching a criminal empire get built is fascinating no
matter how many times we see it, and I agree with that. But when you
have someone as uninteresting as Joe Coughlin, something that is
supposed to be fun to watch turns into a chore. That is probably the
most frustrating thing about this film.Overall, Live by Night is a throwback to classical gangster films that
serves as Ben Affleck's worst directorial effort. With that being said,
the film still features some truly thrilling action sequences that are
bound to satisfy many even if the film is a bloated mess that should
have been larger than what is or nothing at all.",129,2016

reeling from a family tragedy who moves into a remote mansion in
upstate New York with her husband and young son to restore it. She
uncovers a hidden room in the house that does not appear on the floor
plans, and begins experiencing increasingly disorienting visions of the
home's original owners.I have to admit that I was fairly excited by the trailers for this
film; it promised nothing groundbreaking, but appeared by all accounts
to be an at least entertaining Gothic throwbackand I'd assume the
script would lead one to a similar assumption, but the film
unfortunately is something of a self-sabotaging effort. It starts out briskly and glides through the typical haunted house
farefamily arrives at old mansion, wife notices strange things
immediately off the bat; she may be unstable, or the husband may be
oblivious; the child is in imminent danger. These tropes are thrown at
the audience in succession throughout the first act of the film; enter
the second half, and the film seems to turn on its head. The plot
regarding the history of the secret room and the apparent spirits in
the house is sidelined, and suddenly the film becomes an anemic
psychological study of a broken woman. The intrigueor at least what
little there was of itfor all purposes disappears. The last forty minutes of the film especially are marked by awkward,
amateurish editing choices that break any sense of flow, and a frankly
ho-hum performance from Beckinsale. This isn't to say she's a bad
actress, but she certainly seems bored here. The husband character is
essentially useless in the film, and Lucas Till comes in as a
sexualized handyman in the last thirty minutes, far too late to
introduce a character that is apparently supposed to have some
significance to the plot. By the end of the film, I was wondering where
the narrative was attempting to take methrough the journey of a
traumatized woman? Through a family that's falling apart? Through a
haunted house? I still don't quite know, as the film fails to commit to
any of the above in a genuine way. The last scene ties things together
in a neat package, but there is no sense of relief or catharsis.Overall, ""The Disappointments Room"" was a letdown (yes, I'm going to
avoid the pun). In spite of the wonky editing, bad pacing, and general
lack of narrative direction, the worst part of it all was that I
honestly feel there is a good film somewhere in here; not an innovative
one, or even a great one, but at least a good one one that is capable
of delivering a straightforward Gothic horror story without imploding
on itself. One of the few things the film gets right is the atmosphere,
and its most noteworthy scene comes at the end in the form of a
disturbing Victorian-era flashback. Aside from that, ""The
Disappointments Room"" is a lost opportunity. 4/10.",85,2016
256,6.0,7.0,"Christine, one of the best films I've seen this year, might appear at
first to be about a feminist issue - set in 1974 at a small TV station
in Sarasota, Florida, a woman named Christine Lubbock (Rebecca Hall)
has to contend with her male co-workers and male boss, and where they
get preferential treatment (at least seemingly, ultimately) despite
being told by her own boss she's the smartest on there - but it's
strongest as a depiction of mental illness. This is the subject that
actually makes for more compelling subject matter, though it is harsher
to see depicted; I cringe watching this film, it's uncomfortable to
watch, and despite/because of this it's a brilliant depiction of a
bi-polar person and the interior struggle of her life.There are two fronts this film is successful. The first is the
technical aspect. This looks, feels, acted, sounds like a movie from
the period in the 70's (you know, back when American cinema was king as
far as getting deeper into character and mood and technique and showing
a reality moviegoers hadn't been exposed to much before outside of
foreign cinema) with Campos and his DP using zoom lenses and shots that
linger maybe just a little too long, and audio that sometimes (no,
often times) can put us into the state of mind of the character: when
Christine is laser-focused, nothing else can detract from her. When she
is wary, she may hear the sounds outside that make her a little
distracted (there's one scene between Christine and George, played by
Michael C Hall, in a car that made me see/hear this). Not to mention
the clothes, the music (so much bad 70's pop on the precipice of
disco), and how people talked to one another.The other thing that makes it authentic is how Christine and everyone
talks, The dialog here is all about showing the realism of the TV
station, and finding the nuance and what surrounds this woman who is
very smart. It could be said she has a touch of Asperger's along with
the bi-polar, if one wanted to go into a diagnosing-on-the-couch
approach. But that takes away from what Campos and Rebecca Hall
accomplish with this character. One may be reminded of Nightcrawler
from two years ago, also about an ambitious being in the world of news
(also, one should say, with a mental or personality disorder of some
kind, and access to a police radio for the latest scoop), only while
Gyllenhall in that film was a pure sociopath and no lack of
communicating what he thinks/feels/sees, Christine's problems are an
inability to come out with something all the time.To be sure she's surrounded by the kind of news culture that has only
multiplied exponentially over the past four decades; ""If it bleeds, it
leads,"" Christine's boss says, to which Christine reminds him that's a
BS catch-phrase. No matter: the pressure is on to get things that
people want to see, that brings ratings, and the same ""human interest""
stories about locals with Strawberry farms or chicken coops won't cut
it. But what drew me in to this film was how potent the point of view
was for Christine in this world. It's hinted at (or flat out spoken)
that she had some previous anxiety/personality/bi-polar disorder issues
back in Boston where she used to work, and now being in Sarasota isn't
being much of an improvement. So among this news team, where she tries
to find her own path and is up against resistance (some understandable,
some not), and with friends (Maria Dizza as Jean is as good a
supporting performance as from Michael C Hall, and he's really great
here), she makes her own problems but never in a way that makes her
unsympathetic.Christine is closer if anything to Taxi Driver as far as a story of
someone on the edge of an existence, and it's all the more painful
because of what Christine is able and ready to do, her talents and
intuition and in her way mix of innocence and cynicism (though mostly
disbelief) at the world around her, which includes her own pot-smoking
hippie mother. Hall taps into the ball of contradictions in this
character, and I was often on the edge of my seat like this was the
most intense thriller in years.And it's in fact all based on a true story; I had known a couple of the
broad strokes of the story, the climax in particular, and I almost wish
I hadn't. I won't mention what happens to the sometimes awkward, full
articulate but ""not easy to approach"" (as George says to her at one
point) Christine by the end of her story, but even knowing it the
filmmakers and Hall draw us in so inexorably to her interior and
exterior struggles through such precise and heartbreaking storytelling
that I can't shake the feeling this will be with me for a while.",119,2016

because in the film he plays an actor and he's digging the role? IDK.
Not sure I care. But every now and then under his breath he speaks
normally so in some way it's hysterical. The writing is witty and often
times laugh out loud and for a Syfy movie that's saying something.
Special effects are the usual TV sort and nothing special but in my
opinion thus far and mid-way through, the script and the acting save
this movie. Better than most I've seen from this channel. If you can

leads are women, it's about women, and its director is a woman (Sophia
Takal)... it must, by default, be spectacular.Well, sorry to say, it most definitely is not!Not a single review here to-date touches on the fact that this film
borrows  LIFTS  heavily (and poorly) from Ingmar Bergman's 'Persona'. Nor do any of this film's fawning fans notice how it is over-dabbling
with the currently overused device of Multiple Personality Disorder
(now known as D.I.D.).This is an appallingly bad film. There are enough hints dropped to suggest these girls ARE split
personalities of the one character, however... there is also either an
abundant LACK of evidence to confirm it, or CONTRADICTORY evidence to
refute it.Make up your friggen mind!Seriously, nothing makes sufficient sense here. And because this film
is going out of its way to raise questions, but does it so illogically,
I will not waste my time rifling thru the trash to unveil the hidden
truths. This film does not deserve that sort of rigour. That sort of
introspection.Always Shine also bears no capacity for concealing its feminist agenda.
Shame on you for being so blatant. There also exists no intelligence in
this script to neither do that sublimely nor tell a coherent story.At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself what the point was?
What was really worth telling here? And why tell it in such an
intentionally obscure way? Could it be because they thought that being
obscure meant being smart? Clever? Original?Then we have the typical indie ending. A useless long shot of nothing
(this time, our lead walking up a hill in a forest); then the moment of
long staring; then... the notorious abrupt cut to black.Praising the acting, which is indeed excellent, makes up for none of
the poor choices made repeatedly in both the writing and the directing.

261,8.0,7.3,"I didn't like this movie as much as I expected to. Sorry. The movie
centers around Troy Maxon (Denzel Washington), a father to two boys of
different mothers, a husband to Rose (played wonderfully by Viola
Davis) for the past 18 years, an ex-con, a garbage man, and above all,
an ordinary black man in the 1950's. No doubt it was a powerful script that most likely created an
incredible play but it was not meant for the screen. It was obvious
that it was a play, in the way they spoke and entered a room and
carried themselves in a scene. I, of course, have not seen the play so
I cannot speak with 100% certainty but I feel like the script wasn't
adapted for the screen at all. It's not like it needed any major
changes, just a few here and there to improve clarity. The passage of
time confused me throughout. A scene would end and it would be the next
day, then a minute passes and it abruptly jumps to six months later
with no indication. This could be a statement on how his life passed
quickly and routinely, but it felt like a swing and a miss for me. Viola Davis was wonderful. She deserves every award coming her way. I
could sing songs of praise about how magnificent she was. 10/10 for
her. Beautiful.Denzel Washington was certainly egging for an Oscar as he did what he
did, but that's not degrading his performance. He did do good, but it
was a bit distracting when he stole the show and didn't really let the
other actors bounce off each other and him as much. It was all about
him. Even though I constantly found myself criticizing this movie, I did
like it. It had a magnitude that I cannot explain, otherwise I would've
given it a much lower rating. I recommend this if you are willing to. I
will warn you, it is tough to sit through a movie with no one to root
for. Washington's character is not a good person and very unlikable,
you don't really want to cheer him on.",139,2016

things get really interesting, but then things kind of still reach the
same destination you kind of see coming early on. Beta male.It's a shame because the Act II idea was really good, but instead of
seeing it through or down a rabbit hole I feel like they ran out of gas
and went with a lazy ending. Part of the problem is that the main
character's direction flipflops a couple times without any Segue.I noticed the films only about an hour and a half. I think with a few
more drafts and 20 more minutes this couple have been a real shocker
but if anything the ending is reminiscent of a tales of the crypt short
story. Now that story would have worked better if the main character
hadn't done a 180 in Act II.All in all I gotta say skip it on this one. There's better captor role
reversal type films. Actually if you're looking for a good captive movie I recommend
""Chained (2012)"" which stars Vincent D'Onofrio who as you know is in

and it's starting to show - Steven's now at the ripe old age of 64.
Retirement age, and ironically enough in his latest DTV movie End of a
Gun he plays a retired DEA agent - perhaps he's finally accepting his
old age?Anyway, if you're looking at this you should probably know what to
expect by Seagal's DTV movies by now. And this movie does exactly that
- Seagal wanders himself into trouble with some dangerous criminals,
taking no prisoners as he mumbles his way through his lines and flies
his fists around to give the bad guys a beating.Once again, this is another Seagal movie set in Europe, with Paris the
setting this time. He seems to have a bit of an obsession with it,
although there is noticeably less focus on ogling the local women than
there is in his other intercontinental efforts.The main highlight for me was probably the performance of Jade Ewen -
she gave a solid performance in her role as the sneaky but sexy
accomplice of Seagal. She's most famous in Britain as the Eurovision
entry a number of years ago and a brief spell with the
Sugababes...money must be really tight if she's having to flirt with a
pension-age Steven Seagal on screen.Other than that, it's what you've come to expect. The villain is pretty
forgettable and generic (and there's another ""villain"" who the makers
seem to forget about by the end of the film?). A couple of bits where
Seagal is dubbed, but it's very minor. Keoni Waxman directs, making
this his umpteenth collaboration with Seagal - but his projects with
Seagal are usually pretty passable DTV efforts, and the trend doesn't
change here. The running time is a fairly slim 86 minutes, which I
prefer for these kinds of films - all killer, no filler. Make the rides

quite a few genres at once and does so somewhat successfully. The movie
is about the struggle of being taken to hell by a grim reaper type
character which is explained within the movie. Each character is being
judged due to their sins of the past which unfold in a flashback type
way. The story itself is played out quite well albeit completely full
of holes. The supernatural aspect seems to come and go and never really
solidifies itself. The acting is average, no complaints or applause.
When they do head down the gore route, it is poured on well without
being the focal point of the film. I found it interesting enough to

Loach cooperation. It is not a thriller, there are no twists, no peaks
of emotions. It shows the naked reality of our everyday lives with its
great pains and humor at the same time. But, the ""banality"" of these
great pains is the strength of the movie, it shows how every encounter
with the system is the time we face the reality of the system and look
for someone who will give a hand us to survive it. Of course, this is
mostly valid for the working class. The film softly depicts that it is
not a socialist propaganda, because when truly shown the reality itself
unveils as a socialist propaganda. But the film is not another documentaristic presentation of the
everyday life of a worker, as it also shows how to cope with all these
we experience. It is the formation of a solidarity with others like us,
the woman in the queue, the Chinese in the factory, the black in the
warehouse, the clerk at the office... We are already connected, even
with those in other continents. Once we see someone shouting with his
writing on the wall, we should shout with him with our voice. If one of

add to each other. Many murder cases but it seems like a random events
that don't build something or contribute to the characters development.
many useless events are added or at least not used to affect the story
or the characters. The romance is so cheap and the main character fall
in love in just 5 minutes and wanted to propose in a week later. The characters are so shallow. They failed in showing deep
psychological side for the characters despite introducing a Dr. in
criminal psychology as a main character. There are no logic in
introducing the characters. the back stories of side characters are
totally neglected. The main character is always act like a superman
with super skills so he is a thief, a sniper, a hacker and many more. In the end of the a movies out of the blue they try to shove a message
in our mind that the execution is bad act . without any proper
justifications the characters just change their minds. just a sudden

colors, and do them without breaking a sweat. Such is true with ""The River
Wild"", a predictable, but entertaining river rapids adventure/hostage drama.
Streep incorporates her role with strength, humor, and even a bit of
vulnerability. Backed by the menacing Kevin Bacon and the refined David
Strathairn (the ultimate everyman...that's a compliment), Streep holds her
own in a genre that one doesn't necessarily think of when her name comes to
mind. One tremendous scene involves Streep reminding her captor (Bacon) of
the dangers of the upcoming waterfall/rapids system known as ""The
Gauntlet""...Streep whispers determination and threats, promises of anger and
doom, directly into Bacon's ears with a quite rage, only to be turned to an
edge-of-tears monologue when her family comes to mind. Bravo to Curtis
Hanson's pre-""L.A. Confidential"" film (1997's SHOULD HAVE for Director and

the fact that Seagal got to hit people in each version. I mean many of
us watched Seagal to see him perform his unique brand of martial arts

allot of sound effects. Gone are the days of seeing Seagal actually
fighting. OK, so he's put on some weight. Well, allot of weight and
every shot of him was carefully crafted to make sure we didn't see how
huge he has become. But, like everything else in this film, it didn't
work and his bulk was obvious and embarrassing. Now I haven't kept

famous figures that deify their subjects and disregard faults in fear
of tainting the idol they have so perfectly sculpted. In Jackie,
however, Pablo Larrain subverts genre expectations in favor of a
haunting psychological portrait of a woman caught in a terrifying piece
of history. Famous images of Jacqueline Kennedy in her pink Chanel suit
have lingered in the public's collective memory for years, but here,
Larrain allows viewers to experience the week following JFK's
assassination from the perspective of the woman who held his dying body
in her arms. It's shot in an episodic, frantic format that replicates
the psychological turmoil of post-traumatic stress as the line between
past and present blurs. One ghostly scene in particular - soundtracked
by Mica Levi's eerie score - follows Jackie as she wanders the White
House in isolation, exploring various rooms and eventually falling
asleep alone as a widow for the first time. The film's central
performance by Natalie Portman will no doubt gain great attention for
its dedication to every last nuance of Jackie Kennedy's mannerisms and
voice, but the real success rests in Portman's relentless and layered
conveyance of emotion throughout the film. She does not allow the
iconic figure to become a one-dimensional reflection of the public's
memory, but allows viewers to witness the conflicted feelings of
nostalgia, grief, isolation, and tenacity that Kennedy experienced. The
film successful solidifies the lingering of Kennedy's melancholic face
as a fleeting vision set across the 60s horizon, luminous and bruised
at once, but enduring through history.",100,2016

during dialogue there was a noticeable delay between one character
speaking and the next which ruined the flow (what there was of it) of

lack of acting ability, lack of direction (which was also noticeable),
or that the characters were not part of the scene and stood out like
wooden fence posts.According to IMDb the budget for this movie is estimated at £1 million.
It is very hard to see where that amount of money could possibly have
been spent. A few scenes were obviously shot in a makeshift office
somewhere and did not relay the story relating to them.The story is also very weak and seems to be rushed from one element to
another without consideration of making the viewer part of it.Overall one to miss. I have seen student films, and films shot on much

modern times one of his most beloved parts, that of The Scarlet
Pimpernel. This time he's Horatio 'Pimpernel' Smith, archaeologists by
day and rescuer of some of the finest intellectual minds in Germany who
are marked for death by Adolph Hitler.In The Scarlet Pimpernel Howard is a Georgian fop as his cover for the
dashing, unknown, and elusive pimpernel. Substitute fop for tweedy as
he's now an Oxford archeology professor and his cover is a beaut. One of the Nazi Aryan racial vanities was that way back in the day
there was an Aryan civilization. Being the archaeologist he is,
Howard's cover is that he's in Germany on a dig, looking for evidence
of that selfsame civilization. He even brings along several students as
part of the cover.In one scene Howard is wounded when he's disguised as a scarecrow and a
Nazi guard shoots at it to make a point. That does lead to him being
found out by his students, one of them being David Tomlinson, later the
father in Mary Poppins. To a man, they all decide to stay and help him
with his work.Howard's a bachelor here so he doesn't have wife Merle Oberon and her
family dirty laundry to compromise him as he did in The Scarlet
Pimpernel. Here he's dealing with Mary Morris who is collaborating with
the Nazis to keep her musician father, Peter Gawthorne alive.Taking the place of Howard's relentless foe Chauvelin as played by
Raymond Massey is Francis L. Sullivan as General Von Graum of the
Gestapo. Sullivan is a favorite character actor of mine and a joy to
watch in any film he does whether a good guy or the baddest of bad guys

and the outside world as a strange sad little man. He is a widower, and a
single parent. All he has is his daughter and his work to keep him going.But he is also single minded in his pursuit of his knowledge and his
craft.
He gathers his data, forms his postulate and relentlessly pursues his goal
regardless of the establishments thinking on the matter. When he realizes
that he or people that he has met and starts to care for may be injured or
killed if does not act on his theory, he has the moral fortitude to act to
save their lives and prevent tragedy. Unorthodox, yes. Odds against him?
Yes. Do you admire him? YES!!! Dr. Honey versus British Government and
British Airways is prophetic. (e.g. The British Comet disasters of the
early

Thiokol battling NASA over the Challenger launch) James Stewart, a pilot

ingredients for a promising movie: sex, greed, betrayal, lonely/sad
people, users/abusers, and, of course, homicide, all revolving around a
central character who is as manipulative as he is physically alluring--
an homme fatale, as it were. Unfortunately, though it comes close a few
times to fulfilling that promise, ""King Cobra"" ultimately fails to do
so.At the heart of the story is Sean Paul Lockhart (Garrett Clayton), who,
after telling his mother he's going to a film making workshop, leaves
his home in San Diego to go make a solo video for Cobra under the name
Brent Corrigan. Cobra's owner (Christian Slater), re-named Stephen in
the movie, is obviously smitten but grudgingly respects Brent's wishes
to sleep in the sparsely furnished guest room rather than join the
pornographer in his big, luxurious bed. The Internet is quickly smitten
by Cobra's very young discovery, too. Realizing he's got a potential
gold mine, Stephen offers Brent more money to make hardcore videos, and
a star is born.Among Brent's growing fan base are L.A. rent boy Harlow (Keegan Allen)
and his domineering boyfriend/pimp Joe (James Franco). Inspired by
Corrigan's success, Joe starts producing videos starring Harlow. The
move makes them enough money for Joe to put the down payment on a
coveted Dodge Viper (their video company is even called Viper Boyz) for
his star, but not the kind of cash they want or, as it's later
revealed, need. What would really put them on the map--making them
millions!-- is a video featuring Harlow and Brent Corrigan. Fortunately
for them, Corrigan is just as greedy, and after an acrimonious split
from Cobra Video, gay porn's latest ""It"" boy is soon spinning into
Harlow and Joe's orbit. But it's Harlow and Joe who spin out of
control.""King Cobra"" has several effective moments, most belonging to Slater
and Allen. As the owner of Cobra Video, Slater's Stephen is is more sad
than sleazy. He reveals that he turned to making gay porn after living
so many years in the closet, and yet he still hasn't come out to his
family. (His sister--played by an unnecessarily cast Molly
Ringwald--still tries to set him up with women.) When Stephen finally
badgers Brent into having sex with him he's in heaven, but is clearly
heartbroken when Brent rebuffs his attempts to cuddle afterwards.
Allen's eager-to-please Harlow is equally sad, his relationship with
Joe--not to mention his involvement in the sex trade--only deepening
the psychic wounds caused by child sexual abuse, not healing them.And then there's James Franco. That Franco is in this movie is not much of a surprise: Franco worked
with director Justin Kelly before (""I Am Michael""), and ""King Cobra""
caters to Franco's dual fascinations with homosexuality and
pornography. (It's only a matter of time before Franco just gives in to
temptation and asks the Falcon Studio Group to put him in one of its
videos.) Unfortunately for Kelly, he didn't get Oscar Nominated James
Franco. Instead, he got Slumming Soap Opera Guest Star James Franco.
Whatever potential ""King Cobra"" had at being taken seriously is dashed
the moment Franco's on screen, the actor apparently thinking Kelly was
making a porn parody. To be fair, it's not always clear whether Kelly
was trying to make a gay-themed equivalent of ""Foxcatcher"" or a satire
a la ""To Die For,"" but Franco's over-the-top performance is completely
wrong in either case.After Brent reveals he made a few of his early videos before his 18th
birthday, a porn producer for a bigger company tells the performer to
lay low for a while, mentioning that Traci Lords was able to bounce
back from a similar scandal. The Lords reference is fitting for Brent.
Like Lords, Brent Corrigan is a divisive figure in the porn world,
viewed as either a kid who made some bad choices or a scheming little
b--ch. As played by Clayton (much cuter than the real Corrigan, IMO),
he's a little bit of both, leaning more towards portraying him as a
quick learner who's not quite as clever as he thinks he is.Likewise, ""King Cobra"" is not as clever as it thinks it is. Like a lot
of movies set in the world of porn (""Rated X,"" ""Lovelace""), it shows
some skin but it doesn't have enough meat to satisfy its lurid story.
Franco, however, provides plenty of ham.",91,2016

likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying
for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be
mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the
four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the
mouse.Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the
goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and
Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must
find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen
one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking
over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef.
Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying
man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson, as the demigod
Maui. It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in
this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his
talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this
piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O
in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer,
Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the
old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and
important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the
nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've
been listening to the soundtrack ever since. The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films
like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt.
The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel
the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The
animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters
find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated
with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far
behind. Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice
acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer
Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she
really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud
that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either.
This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to
find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the
future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a
man. Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female
lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great
time for adults. Moana is a great film.",107,2016

ingredients which a suspense/thriller movie demands. Story was OK,
acting was OK, dialogues were OK according to the scene neither more
nor less, cinematography was also good. I think it was a perfect movie
i don't know why people have given below 5 rating with bad comments.
For me if you have to watch a suspense/ thriller and horror movie then
there are some rules to apply before watching. first you make an
environment for the movie, you have no other work to do between the
movie, you don't talk between the movie, you don't even miss a single
dialogue, your lights should turn off so that your focus should be
completely on the movie. So i think those who have given it less than 5
rating did not apply those rules otherwise the rating of this movie
should have been not less than 6.",91,2016
286,8.5,5.7,"Warren Beatty, who I consider to be a true Hollywood legend and quite
an icon, has always impressed me with his body of work. I have always
admired him as an actor and maybe even more so as a writer/director. As
many of you know, he has not directed a film since 1998's Bulworth and
not acted in a film since Town and Country in 2001. Over the years
there was always some talk about Beatty perhaps making a comeback film
and emerge from the shadows and quietness of what at the time seemed to
be almost like a retirement from the movie business for him. It had
been speculated for years that he was planning on doing a film about
Howard Hughes, and not only till a few years ago was the project
actually green-lighted and news was that they had a cast and that
Beatty would not only be starring in the film, but also having written
the screenplay and was going to serve as director. This was very
promising news to a fan like me because unfortunately I had never been
able to see one of his films on the big screen, so I was hoping this
one would be my first. The first trailer for the film emerged during
the Summertime when you had your big budget films on display and while
the trailer looked a little different than what Beatty has done before,
I still felt that it looked like a film with promise and I was bound
and determined to see it on the big screen when it arrived. Now as I am
writing this, I have just come from a screening for his new film, Rules
Don't Apply, and I must say that I was anticipating a light screwball
comedy that would be more fun than anything else, but what I got was a
film that will definitely be in my top 10 list by the end of the year
and was another film that far exceeded all my expectations and turned
out to be one of the year's best. The film's trailer truly did not do
it justice and unfortunately a lot of the mainstream film critics are
giving it average to mostly lukewarm ratings, which if I have to be
honest, I don't truly understand and perhaps they saw a different film
than I did. The other unfortunate thing is that Rules Don't Apply, is
flopping at the box office and is going to lose the studio a lot of
money much like Town and Country did back in 2001, which is why I
initially thought that Beatty had retired from movies. Do not let any
of this deter you whatsoever from seeing this great film though. I
simply say this more as unfortunate news and to further add to the
argument that what is popular and does well at the box office these
days has no accounting for any artistic merit and what are sometimes
fantastic films will unfortunately flop and not connect, or appeal to
today's audiences. I think that alone is one of the key elements why
this film is not doing well, simply because a millennial audience, who
in a lot of ways controls what is big and what does well at the box
office would simply not be able to connect with this film on any level.
Many of those viewers would not know who Howard Hughes is, or really
care for that matter and for a lot of them they unfortunately have
probably never heard of Warren Beatty, or seen any of his films either.
Also a period piece film that is far more intelligent than what the
trailer would seem, would simply not appeal and go far beyond this
audience's limited and sometimes unfortunately dull attention span.
Luckily for anyone else who loves a good film, you are in for a real
treat here. Beatty is back in full force delivering a brilliant
performance that at times includes elements of a comedic nature, but
also in a way he slyly pokes fun at Hughes and even his own past
reputation as a playboy who was promiscuous and not altogether with
what was going on. Beatty's Hughes is a man who clearly has done some
very admirable things for his shareholders and business people, but as
a man his values and what he stands for are not very reputable and also
in some ways it could be argued that he may have early dementia, or
something that is causing him to act and behave very strangely. The
Howard Hughes story is interesting enough on it's own, but also as a
bonus we are given a story just as interesting about two young people
who are trying to make it in Hollywood, and how in a sense their
personal beliefs, values and everything they stand for is ruined not
only because of the Hollywood system, but also because of people like
Hughes himself. The film has many laughs, but in an interesting
contrast it also has darker elements that all balance out and work
beautifully for the film. The film is far beyond entertaining and it
also adds a fair bit of food for thought about one's actions and the
role models and goals that we have and the things that can
unfortunately cloud, or pollute them. This is the best ensemble cast
performance I have seen this year and everybody is absolutely
fantastic. Also the attention to details, costumes, makeup, music and
the script and direction by Beatty is all top notch and among the
year's best. I hope this does signal a comeback for Beatty because here
he proves he still has so much talent to offer and I hope this will not
be his last film, but many more will follow. One of the year's absolute
best and a very misunderstood film.",127,2016
287,8.5,7.6,"After seeing this movie, and then seeing the other reviews for it
online, I felt the need to write my opinion in order to share why some
did not like it and why I feel it could have been far better under
different direction.First of all, I generally like Marvel's films. They manage to put out
new stories virtually every year and incorporate new characters into
their ensemble. They've also mastered the art of masking each film as
original and fresh, and for the most part it's just a fun time at the
cinema. But the problem is that eventually, while you will always be
able to pick new heroes from the massive wealth Marvel has created
through comics, the formula, the acting, the uninspired scripts and
classic gimmicks will become stagnant and even begin to bore the
audience. I wanted to like Doctor Strange, and I, too, was convinced by the
trailers that it would be captivating and interesting and thought-
provoking. But twenty minutes into the movie and I could already tell
how this was probably going to go.The acting was to be expected given the cast they chose, but nothing
stood out. Benedict Cumberbatch played a convincing Doctor Strange, but
his character was completely static - I felt no indication that he had
changed in the slightest by the end of the film (which is what the
filmmakers were lazily trying to portray), and I couldn't even figure
out why he suddenly wanted to fight the enemy in the first place. The
rest of the characters were poorly fleshed out, and I found myself
caring little for any of them, a phenomenon that did not occur when I
watched ""Iron Man"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". The jokes and
wise-cracks felt especially childish this time around, and even out of
place in the face of sincerely substantial ideas such as alternate
dimensions and the fabric of time and space. Additionally, the pace
simply felt rushed and awkward, and like I said before, I just couldn't
find myself caring for any of the one- dimensional, superficial
characters.The plot was formulaic, which is typical and expected of Marvel; hero
suddenly has powers, hero is confronted by conflict larger than
himself, hero acts selflessly to save the day and the girl, hero
returns and the film ends with some good old fashioned comic relief
(Wang laughing, in this case). Normally I could enjoy this, but
combined with the tepid acting, shallow characters and strange pacing,
the whole plot and film just felt... tired. Even with the great visuals
(which were truly impressive and to the benefit of the movie), I simply
didn't enjoy it. I wanted more, a more interesting script that had at
least a couple memorable or provocative lines rather than none, a
stronger character arc, a better and more menacing villain (spoilers
aside, the final confrontation was COMPLETELY underwhelming and mildly
ridiculous), and, all-in-all, a more enticing movie. I really think ""Doctor Strange"" could have been a lot better of a film,
but I feel like the filmmakers were just flat-out lazy this time
around. While I do recognize the cash-cow that is Marvel, I just hope
this isn't the beginning of the end for their good movies, movies with
at least a little bit of substance. They still plan to cram over a
dozen heroes into Infinity War, and if as little heart and care is put
into it as was put into this one, it could be a very bad, shallow,
exhausted film.3.5/10 for great visuals and a relatively coherent plot.",115,2016
288,4.5,7.5,"Reading other peoples' comments makes me a minority I believe, but
there was just something that didn't win me over with Moonlight. Don't
get me wrong, my favorite movie genre is drama and I really appreciate
deep and artistically made coming-of-age dramas too, but I could barely
contain my restlessness in these two hours. There was so little
dialogue (and even if it was there, it didn't bear any importance) that
it was difficult for me to get to know the characters, let alone like
them or care for them. Although the plot may be relatable to some
people, it just wasn't original. It felt like one cliché was followed
by another. Maybe the main problem is that I couldn't wait to watch it, I read so
many brilliant reviews and eight Oscar nominations built up my
expectations. Well, Moonlight in my opinion was a disappointment and
even though I wanted to like it, it just didn't happen. I will still
give the movie a 3 because it is not a disaster, the acting is decent
and I appreciate the director didn't want to show another story of a
white and privileged man. Movies with this type of message are
important for our society, but I would not recommend watching this
particular one.",111,2016
289,14.8,7.1,"'Allied' has garnered a mixed reaction, on IMDb and with critics in
general. This is completely understandable, and the mixed reaction and
the reasoning for it mirrors my own feelings for the film. 'Allied' is
not a bad film, but from seeing the trailers (which strongly suggested
a film that would be more epic, more moving and more thrilling) to be
honest was expecting a lot more.There is a lot to like about 'Allied'. Visually, it is a gorgeous film.
The cinematography is rich in atmosphere and colour and is quite poetic
too, while the sets, scenery and costumes are evocative and
eye-catching. The music by Alan Silvestri is neither too intrusive or
too low-key, instead stirring when it needs to be and understated again
when needed. There are some thrilling and harrowing moments as well as
some poignant ones in the more intimate scenes, personally thought the
controversial ending was quite emotional but can definitely see why it
won't work for some.Marion Cotillard gives a nuanced and deeply felt turn, nothing short of
sensational. Brad Pitt's performance has been criticised (as well as
defended), to me it was appropriately stoic, despite his character
being nowhere near as meaty as Cotillard's, and he was a worthy partner
for Cotillard, a little cold in places but mostly fiery. The supporting
cast are fine.On the other hand, the script and pacing are uneven. The script is
'Allied's' biggest flaw, lacking plausibility in places, especially in
the mission scenes, having too much padding that's overlong and adds
little to nothing and some of the parts intended to be emotional laid
it on too thick with the treacle and sentimentality. Much more could
have been done with the psychological subtext, which would have made
Pitt's character more interesting and given the story more consistent
suspense and thrills.Pacing does drag badly frequently, primarily due to having superfluous
scenes that lacked momentum and went on too long and also due to Robert
Zemeckis' quite disappointing direction. There are moments, but it is a
case of getting the job done but in a workmanlike and tame fashion, not
the thrills and cleverness one expects from Zemeckis that is present in
the best of his work.In summary, had potential to be epic as a wartime romance, but doesn't
quite make it. Many great things, but a few big things that got in the
way of fulfilling full potential. 6/10 Bethany Cox",124,2016

291,7.0,5.4,"About 70% of this documentary  about a nutjob up in Harlem who kept a
pet tiger and alligator in a 3-room apartment until the tiger tried to
chew his leg off and the cops showed up  is a staged static-camera
recreation of a tiger and an alligator (not the real ones, whose names
were Ming and Al) roaming around a studio-set facsimile of the
apartment . Literally, for something like 40 minutes, all we see is an
alligator wandering past the camera, sniffing something in a corner,
disappearing again, then reappearing. Clearly the filmmakers didn't
have enough material from which to spin an actual documentary, which
also explains the endless artfully-framed shots of Harlem streets and
interiors, which seem to serve no purpose other than to fill up
footage. The rest of the film is long tracking shots of a car driving
around Harlem with the aforementioned nutjob, Antoine Yates, being
chauffeured around to old haunts. I admit, he has a certain antic
charm, but not nearly enough to glue this mess of a film together. When
you realize, through Antoine's comments, that he not only thinks there
was nothing wrong with keeping a pet alligator and tiger in a Harlem

that feature visuals like these, the movie doesn't paint them
positively. Instead, our main character is trapped in a terrifying

rough split almost two decades prior, she reads into every word. The manuscript weaves a story that resonates with her broken state of

reconnect? Or something else entirely? Cue top class acting and a story

299,4.5,6.1,"DARK MATTER is a film that will polarize audiences: for those who seek
understanding of the clashes between science and 'religion' and the
matrix from which tragedy grows the film will appeal, and for the
audiences who demand tidy stories with happy resolutions the film will
not please. Apparently 'based on true events', this story has many
layers that invite discussion and reveals some facts about the American
Academia that many would rather not know. Liu Xing (Ye Liu) comes from a poor family in Beijing, but rises to
hopeful heights due to his exceptional scientific intelligence and is
invited to a prestigious university to study with Cosmology professor
Jacob Reiser (Aidan Quinn), the author of the Reiser String Theory -
the entire universe is tied into a compact single ball of cosmic wax.
Liu Xing encounters initial success not only academically but also as a
fresh young student, barely able to speak English, who is taken under
the wing of the kind matron of Chinese culture, Johanna Silver (Meryl
Streep). Liu Xing develops his own theory that the universe is united
by massive amounts of unseen Dark Matter. When the student's theory
conflicts with Reiser's theory, the negative results begin to affect
each of the characters: Liu Xing sees his dream of earning a PhD in
Cosmology and winning the Nobel Prize for his theory destroyed by the
powers of academia and as he watches his fellow Chinese students
succeed, he is plagued with low self esteem as he attempts to support
his family in Beijing with money earned selling cosmetics door to door.
The downfall of a simple genius destroyed by the inner workings of
academia leads to unimaginable tragedy. Billy Shebar's screenplay tinkers with the story's credibility with a
heavy dose of sentimentality at times, but director Shi-Zheng Chen
keeps the story moving by allowing the audience to witness frequent
glimpses of Liu Xing's humble Beijing home life. The star of the film
is the very talented Ye Liu, but Streep and Quinn carry their rather
minor roles with great dignity and understatement. This is a moving
story, too frequently repeated in our campuses to overlook. There is
much more to this film than first viewings reveal. Grady Harp",88,2007

the finest, ranking up there with The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.

Fanelon, one can't help feeling that she captured the role. My only
criticism is the newswreel type footage used to depict the moving trains.

this movie had humongous hair. Whenever she was on the screen I
couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair. Take about stage
presence! There seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in
this movie also. There was a traffic warden writing out a parking
ticket who somehow didn't notice the owner plunging toward the car
screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was
a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge bulldozer coming at him
until it was 5 feet away. All the hit men in this movie seemed a bit
deaf, no one had to sneak up on them. The one handed 'hero' of this
movie was so whiny and ineffective that it was funny. The bar-fight was
pretty funny. There is a priceless scene where the hero and his
girlfriend just had sex and judging from their expressions, it wasn't
good for either one of them. It made me laugh out loud. This movie is

308,6.5,7.4,"What seems to be the typical ""teen"" movie of young teenagers in high
school ends up being an unusual movie of its kind. I explain: although
it is true that the film is a teen movie (it does not deceive anyone),
it is also true that it is more complex and adult than it appears at
first glance.It is true that the film has the typical clichés of the genre, I will
not lie, but still breaks with the typical dynamics of these films, as
it shows a fragile girl and reveals all her fears. The viewer sees how
Nadine is with her problems and concerns.Mention aside its two protagonists: Haliee Steinfeld. It is the ideal
actress for the character of Nadine, she is the queen of the film and
manages to make her character credible at all times, getting you to
empathize with her and make the film an extraordinary work within the
genre. Without she, the film probably would not have been just as good.
The other character is Woody Harrelson. Seriously, incredible, all the
scenes that come out are great. He does a very good role, and the
peculiar Nadine-professor couple with their conversations are the best.To finish, to say that it is a film that is very worthwhile, and that
reflects in a superb way the stage that we have all passed, that stage
that can be wonderful as well as tragic, that we are misunderstood by
all and believe that nobody Understands, that terrifies us and that we
have all had to face it with fear to finish knowing ourselves: the

mother, she's faced with making some tough decisions regarding the

this film, I don't think it was adapted from the play very well. The
dialogue, direction, style of acting and even some of the special

313,17.5,8.0,"Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a linguist who teaches at a College. One
day, twelve giant spacecrafts appear in random locations across the
world overnight. Louise's skills make her a requirement for the U.S
forces, who recruit her - and mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy
Renner) - to attempt to decode and translate the language that the
creatures inside the spacecrafts are using in order to prevent a global
war. Alien invasion films have, frankly, been done to death. Arrival's
script - penned by Eric Heisserer and adapted from Ted Chiang's short
story ""Story of Your Life"" - is ingenious in that it finds an entirely
new angle to focus the whole thing on. Rather than start a war and
depict the bloodshed and trauma of an alien invasion, Arrival focuses
on the struggle to communicate with the creatures (dubbed ""Heptapods""),
and what the aftermath of this could lead to should it not go to plan.
The whole thing is pieced together like a piece of art - the
performances, dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack, screenplay, editing
and direction all form one elegantly structured whole. It's a simply
astonishing feat of film making.Arrival finds strength in just about everything it is comprised of. It
does this to such an extent, in fact, that it's almost impossible to
break it down into individual pieces. Amy Adams is superb here, giving
a subdued but deeply moving performance. A lot of the film rests on her
shoulders for its twists and turns to stick the landing, but she
carries it without breaking a sweat. Never given any big Oscar-esque
moments, Adams tells Louise's story in her softest moments and through
her body language. It's an astoundingly delicate performance. Renner is
also solid, and accompanies Adams nicely, even if he can't help but
feel woefully overshadowed. Louise as a character is the film's most
exciting element - a woman that uses her knowledge and skills to change
the world in ways it has never been changed before, all of which comes
down to language. When Arrival ends, you will spend hours thinking
about yourself and the language you speak and use every day. The
potential behind this story was astronomical, and it delivers in
spades.Much like in his previous film Sicario, Villeneuve has created a
masterful aesthetic in every way. The film's soundtrack, courtesy of
the terrific Jóhann Jóhannsson, is a sublime array of thumping horn
arrangements and softer pieces. The cinematography (by Bradford Young)
is breathtaking, bringing in references and odes to other sci-fi
classics (notably 2001: A Space Oddysey) but successfully acting as a
perfect match to the tone of each sequence. The flashback sequences
focused on Louise's young daughter look and feel like forgotten
memories, while the moments inside the spacecrafts feel entirely alien.
The production design is stunning, the large pitch black objects
hovering over the cities feel instantly dark and foreboding, and the
brief sights of the creatures we're given reveal something wholly
original. In terms of technicalities and aesthetic, Arrival is a thing
of beauty - a unique, visually resplendent film that you never want to
take your eyes off of.But where Arrival hits perfection, though? The emotion. The power
behind the story, and the direction the story takes in its tremendous
final act. This is what makes Arrival such a phenomenal film. It sets
up a story (an already thought-provoking and well paced one, at that),
and then smoothly transforms into something much bigger than you could
ever have expected it to be. Another stroke of ingeniousness is that
the film doesn't do this in one movement. Rather than drop one
bombshell and change its direction, Arrival slowly sets up a series of
events, then puts them in motion one by one, binding everything neatly
around its central character. Y'know that feeling you get when an
absolutely killer plot twist lands? Arrival will give you that feeling
for the entirety of its final act. It is, of course, entirely possible
to work out where it is headed. I did, as a matter of fact, and it just
made the whole thing feel that little bit more special. You either work
it out and watch as it comes to life before your eyes, or you
cluelessly dedicate your time to its finale and feel mesmerised at each
and every turn. Whichever you experience, it is wonderful.Arrival is a film that feels thrilling in its own unique little way.
When it ends, and you discuss it for hours (which is inevitable),
you'll find yourself not focusing on the aliens. You'll be focusing on
the emotional power of it all, on the human side of the story. I've
deliberately left a lot out of this review, just to avoid spoiling the
direction the film takes in its final act. The power behind the
constant twists and turns is game changing; it proves that science
fiction can be, despite what the name might imply, the most human genre
to make a film about. Arrival has some stunning imagery and effects to
play around with, but instead it focuses on language and conversation.
It focuses on humanity and time and memory, and all that is worth
fighting for on this planet. It is a breathtaking achievement, and one
I already cannot wait to experience countless times again. In a year
riddled with emotionless superhero films and crude comedies, Arrival is
a godsend. Villeneuve has been on the verge of a masterpiece for the
last few years, and he has finally landed it. Arrival is a film for the
ages. Seek it out at all costs, and let it transport you across time
and space only to bring you back down to Earth, evoking a feeling you
may never have experienced before. This, people, this right here is why

stick and unlucky coincidence makes it that he gets taken away further
and further from home as the film goes on. It goes on for 26 minutes
and the thing takes place at Christmas. In the end Santa gives to the
stick man after the Stick Man helped Santa before. A cute little film,
mostly for younger audiences, but grown-ups can also have fun. The cast
includes Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins, Emmy winner Martin Freeman (for
the main character) and Golden Globe nominee Hugh Bonnevill voicing
Santa. Not bad for a television production. I personally thought this

Christmas of the Great War is very moving. Although the truce was not a
generalized event, it did happen in quite a few areas all along the
front line. It was the only moment of sanity in an otherwise gruesome
experience in futility. Twenty years later, these same countries would
be at it again.Karl Marx said that wars are awful events pitting
ordinary people (proletariats) one against another for the benefit of
the wealthy, the powerful, the aristocrats. This aspect is depicted
very well in this movie. I would just like to add a footnote: Alfred

mime), so that was enough to convince me to go and watch it.War on Everyone is a buddy-cop black comedy starring Michael Pena and
Alexander Skarsgard, who play corrupt cops. The main plot is that a
heist occurred and they see the money as theirs.The comedy was mixed with parts that were quite surreal; the best
comparison I can think of is to 1991's Hudson Hawk (a film which to
this day is very divisive). Some of the comedy had me laughing until I
was nearly crying (the scene in Reykjavik was probably the best
example).Some more examples include when they kick in a door to a house, guns
out, they still have the burgers they were eating in their other hands.
They find a man bleeding out with a knife in his gut and his wife sat
there crying. So they carry on eating their burgers.Personally, I really enjoyed this film, but it appealed to my sense of
humour, which I fully accept may not be considered the norm (I enjoy

319,20.5,6.3,"Louis Drax is an accident-prone nine year old. Having endured eight
near-death accidents throughout his life, according to cat years, he
would be on his last and is fully aware that he may never grow up
before his time comes to an end. With this knowledge and history behind
him, he finds himself in a coma after falling off the edge of a cliff,
and the circumstances of which are left a vague mystery to be
uncovered, including the related disappearance of his father. Was it an
accident? Or was it something more? Amidst all this, his doctor becomes
entranced with his mother, despite mysterious warnings to the contrary,
and he finds himself in an unconscious journey of discovery with a
creepy creature.Tonally the movie is all over the place, which can make it feel a
little uneven, but at the same time I felt it kind of worked. The movie
opens with a montage of Louis' life told from a black comedy angle.
Obviously what happens to him isn't exactly nice, but it's played for
laughs. If you don't like black comedy, this opening sequence will turn
you off immediately. This soon gives way to melancholy when the tragedy
unfolds, which is about as much of a stark contrast as you can get.
There's also some freakier moments revolving around the creature, a
typically romantic tone between Pascal and Natalie, and in it's
penultimate moments it shifts more into thriller territory. However, I
never felt this was jarring at all. Every shift in tone suited the
scenes perfectly, and evolved organically from one to the other.It's central driving force is the mystery surrounding the circumstances
of his fall, which inevitably culminates in a twist or two as the
movie's finale approaches. The big twist isn't so much of a twist as it
is a slow evolution over the course of the movie. It's not just
signposted, it's actively developed as we go along and learn more and
more about the characters and their own stories. The way this all comes
to light can be a little hard to swallow, and doesn't take the time to
explain itself, namely telepathy and the ability to talk to the dead.
This is where the more fantastical elements of the movie come to the
forefront, but due to the various shifts in tones, I didn't find this
too much of a leap. It was obviously not attempting to be even remotely
realistic. I just wish they gave some kind of explanation for it rather
than just briskly moving on. There is another minor twist as well
though, and I'll confess that did throw me for a loop, but I won't
spoil that.Aiden Longworth, Jamie Dornan, and Sarah Gadon do really well in their
major roles, without particularly breaking any new ground. Dornan in
particular seems a bit bland in most of his appearances, but I'm not
sure whether that's down to him or what he was given to work with. It
wasn't too much of a distraction either way. However the real stars are
some of the more supporting actors. Oliver Platt and Barbara Hershey
really tear up their limited screen time as Dr. Perez and Louis'
grandmother respectively. And of course Aaron Paul does what he does
best. The chemistry he shares with Longworth goes a long way to
developing their father-son relationship and leads to one of the
movie's most heartbreaking scenes. Again though, I couldn't shake the
feeling that Paul was cast for his ability to cry on demand. I'm not
saying it's a bad thing; I love seeing Aaron Paul cry in movies, as
he's always so genuine with it, but I fear he's getting a little
typecast and may be relying on it too much (not in this movie, just in
general).The big thing that drew me to the movie in the first place though was
the visual quality, and while it's not quite as I expected, I can't say
that I'm disappointed. Almost the entire movie is bathed in a dreamy
glow, both the moments in dream or flashback, and the current events.
It generally gave a very ethereal quality to everything. There was some
differentiation between dreams/flashbacks and real life though and that
was largely thanks to the colour pallet, particularly early on. Louis'
happier moments are awash with golds and reds and other warm colours,
while the more melancholic present day scenes had a cold, blue hue. The
scenes with the creature also seemed to have a subtle hint of green to
them as well.Louis Drax is certain to be another one of those movies I put on the
pile of 'movies I love that everyone else hates', but I don't care.
It's story is intriguing with interesting developments as it goes
along, despite it's missteps and shifts in tone, the character work is
a good attempt even if it doesn't always land the mark, and it's visual
appearance is a feast for the eyes even if it isn't particularly
innovative or creative. I give Louis Drax a very good 8/10, but also
acknowledge it's not a movie that will suit everyone's tastes. I
thoroughly enjoyed it, but I was also open to and prepared for
something a bit off-the-wall.",108,2016

older sister who i couldn't stand), the locations while not
outrageously exciting or exotic, provide just enough to make do.
There's bits of nudity so cant complain there, the odd funny scene and
wtf/awww yeah moment. That said there's some sound issues where the
sound will just go skitzo, luckily this isn't a common occurrence so
can be over looked. I think if this had a big budget it could be truly

321,7.0,6.1,"I really like the Fanning sisters so I'll basically watch anything with
them. I was also curious about this film because its the directional
debut of Ewan McGregor. I went in blind not knowing what the film would
bring but it seemed to have a strong cast, and for the little buzz it
generated it remained something that I really wanted to check out. I
think its a solid debut for McGregor as a filmmaker but can't escape
being too dull at times.The film is based on a novel about a family with a daughter with a
speech impediment. She witnesses a traumatic scene of the infamous monk
setting himself on fire in television. After this childhood incident
Merry (Fanning's character) becomes a radical opponent of war. She
starts out vehemently opposing Lyndon Johnson and the war efforts but
eventually becomes the culprit in a murder after a bomb goes off. Swede
(Ewan McGregor) spends most of the film trying to find his estranged
daughter and find out why she is the way she is.I think the film has strong performances as you would expect from the
cast of this caliber. You immediately see the disenchantment of youth
in Fanning's character and understand how radical she is in her
anti-war stance. Her pained relationship with her mother is stated
quite well, and the uncomfortably in it drives her mother mad. I had no
problems with the character interactions, however the film cannot
escape feeling dull and prolonged. You don't care enough to follow
Swede as he tries to find his daughter, and when you finally find her,
its just very underwhelming.Its hard to care for Fanning's character as she's unlikable from the
get go. The film doesn't offer much else outside of a quest for a
character you'd rather remain lost. The method of storytelling does not
always prosper as it goes through periods of stalling and the payoff
isn't really entertaining. It gets very lost in an antiwar shuffle and
remains shallow despite trying to go deep. I'd say its exciting to see
McGregor get behind the camera but his first adaptation does not have
enough life.6/10",108,2016

however, the cyborgs' boss (John Saxon) decides to have our hero wiped

It takes a while to get going (nothing much happens in the first half

sequels really suck...but this stands alone as a classic. A must-see

326,6.5,6.0,"For the record, I love Thanksgiving and am not a fan of putting up
Christmas trees this early, but I can appreciate a feel-good holiday
film anytime of the year.Unfortunately for director David E. Talbert, this delivered few laughs
and some grunts and sighs. It's to be expected, though, as these sorts
of films make their rounds ad nauseam during the holidays.Almost Christmas brings together a recognizable cast, which includes
Danny Glover, Mo'Nique and Gabrielle Union, that surely makes the
characters more appealing to moviegoers. The premise for this film
surrounds a family reunion during Christmas in Birmingham, Alabama,
months after Walter's (Glover) wife, Grace, dies. The once- functional
family struggles to get along due to implicit and explicit frustrations
among one another.Ain't No Woman Like the One I Got by the Four Tops softly plays in the
background as a very quick opening montage through the years shows how
Walter, Grace and their family loved each other. What struck through
the first half hour was a sense of composure, which some of these
one-time holiday films usually fail to achieve.As the five-day countdown until Christmas began, the comedic writing by
Talbert kicked into gear and shoved more of the serious tones out of
the window. Aunt May (Mo'Nique) is very outspoken and makes her
presence known from the minute she appears. Most of the personal
insults come from her, but not all were cringe-worthy. I even found
myself laughing in-between the more heavy-handed jokes, but it was
almost too obvious in moments that the stage was her's.However, there were far too many cheesy moments and exactly that:
heavy-handed jokes. Yeah, we get it, children love their iPhones and
documenting everything for social media. But do we need to hear them
shout, ""Worldstar!""? Yeah, we also get that Uncle Lonnie (J.B. Smoove)
is making Santa Claus butt jokes, but you don't need to linger on the
fact that they're butt jokes. Make 'em and move forward, except for the
Worldstar joke. Don't ever make that joke again.The movie also introduces Jessie T. Usher for the first time since
Independence Day: Resurgence. Usher plays Evan, Walter's son and a star
college football athlete who has everything, yet is addicted to
painkillers he was prescribed for his once-injured shoulder. The film
uses his drug use to teach a lesson later in the film that was oddly
placed in-between another conflict.Rachel (Union) and her sister, Cheryl (Kimberly Elise), have a bad
relationship to boot which ends up being the best relationship/conflict
throughout the film. The other relationships were  eh, forgettable.
There's a weaker subplot which involves Christian (Romany Malco),
Walter's son-turned-politician, and it feels like it's no more than a
stopgap for the ""Christmas miracle"" of the film. It was added to the
list of generic moments triggered by the film's screenplay.Glover adds little to the film as it moves on other than stopping
arguments and reminding his children and family that they need to love
rather than shout. It's understandable why he's soft-spoken throughout
the entire film after losing his wife, but this showcases that his best
acting days may be behind him.I feel the movie will resonate well with audiences that can truly
relate to the dysfunction of dinners during the holidays. There were
many specific moments where the theater was in raucous laughter and
others that struck heartstrings. There's fun found in a dancing scene,
and Almost Christmas ends as it began: with the Four Tops. Seriously
speaking, it ends on a feel-good note and is tolerable, but it just
doesn't bring enough to the table to break out of its generic shell.",111,2016

their primary market, but I still love this movie!Being a raver at heart, it's fun to watch these troll live in the
ultimate psychedelic fantasy. With non-stop music, dancing, hugs, and
trippy hairdos, these Trolls know how to keep it PLUR! I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but this movie has a nice
variety of songs and keeps them short, fun, and too the point. Never a
moment to get bored. Most of the songs are very cliché, generic, pop
songs, but they are catchy and upbeat, so it's hard to complain.Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake have great chemistry and put a lot
of personality into the characters. I think they nailed it.I feel like the team that made this movie did a great job collaborating
between the writing, acting, and animation to create lots of really
great moments for characters that a truly hilarious. Unlike most
comedies, this one seems to get funnier each time I watch it. I can't
get enough of the fun characters and find myself smiling throughout the
day thinking of the great moments in this film.Creative musical numbers like ""Sounds of Darkness"" perfectly complement
hilarious comedy scenes like the encounter with M. Cloud, and lead me
to believe that the guys who directed this movie have a lot of talent. I'm surprised this film doesn't have a higher rating. I really can't
think of what is not to like, but I'm guessing it's just one of those
things where you either love it or hate it. I can see it becoming
somewhat of a cult classic. I really hope it made enough money that we
will get to see a sequel!",0,2016

checking out the movie's score here, I went out of my way to write my
very first review on IMDb.I've just finished watching ""Sinners & Saints"" and after doing a quick
search for the song playing when the credits were rolling (great song
by the way, if anyone is interested look for ""Johnny Strong - Let You
Go""), I came to IMDb where I usually check and read about movies, and I
must say I'm a bit disappointed with the rating this movie had.To start off, this is no original movie, so don't expect to have your
mind blown out of the way and don't expect to see any breath taking
plot twists. Though this movie doesn't add anything especially new to
the recipe it does a very good job in setting itself apart from other
action movies.I have rarely found myself so captivated by a shoot-out movie. It made
me lose track of reality and I found myself cheering for the main
character and hating the ""villains"", which although it might seem like
a simple enough premise, it is something that very few of the movies
I've seen lately managed to accomplish.I don't want to spoil anything, nor do I want to set any special
expectations, so I will refrain myself from saying anything about the
action scenes or character development.I have really enjoyed watching ""Sinners & Saints"". It said something

330,12.5,7.0,"""Closet Monster"", directed by Stephen Dunn, its beautiful, engaging,
passionate and delightful. A true marvel, and a great experience.The film tells the story of Oscar (wonderfully played by Connor
Jessup), a teenager who deals with many problems in his life, most
notably his parents divorce, which leaves him living with his father,
Peter (played by Aaron Abrams), who is not always kind to Oscar, in
fact, he often makes life for Oscar a notch harder, Oscar is an
innocent guy, but hes not naive, hes kind and respectful, but not
overly so, he's a little bit of an asshole sometimes, but not to the
point where he becomes unlikable, he feels, looks and sounds like a
real person, flawed, but real. Dunn captures the anguish and
awkwardness of a teenager quite well, by the time the film was over I
felt as I have been knowing Oscar for all my life.I don't dare myself to classify this film as a ""gay movie"" because the
film doesn't classify itself as such, it just its what it is, it's
unique. The film tells the viewer to don't look for a place to fit,
look for a place where you can be yourself, whether you have to be with
your family, or with your friends, or even by yourself, its not of
importance.I found myself quite saddened by this film, I shed tears at the moment
Oscar said to his mom ""Am I a bad person?"" as I realized that I myself
have asked that question to myself before, for the same reasons Oscar
did. Oscar is a lonely person, and an anguish one too, but he manages
to find a comfortable place where he can be himself.Definitely recommended, a magnificent film.",90,2015
331,4.0,5.8,"There's an unwritten rule when it comes to bratpack comedies  Don't
expect much wit. Masterminds has none and that's not even the biggest
downside given the combined comic talent in this film.With a lineup comprising of Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson and Jason
Sudeikis, it's hard not to recall bratpack comedies like Hall Pass or
The Hangover. Those films were not very witty either but they were
setup to be outrageously funny and they delivered with laugh-out-loud
gags. On the other hand, Masterminds has been in production hell for a
long time and was supposed to be released over a year ago. While this
doesn't say much about the overall production and budget, it explains
why there are as many as six writers for the screenplay. That's never a
good sign and it shows  jokes are not only a misfire but the repeated
use of toilet humour is a definite indication of lazy writing and poor
taste.It is still interesting to note that this film is based on a real life
robbery. Details of the heist are almost identical including actual
names of the perpetrators, and set in the 90s, this film could have
even worked as a Martin Scorsese crime caper. Instead, Galifianakis is
in the lead as real criminal David Ghantt but resembling Jim Carrey
from Dumb and Dumber. And as expected, his character is as bright as a
flickering lightbulb. Orchestrated by Steve (Wilson as the titular
perp), the plan is to con Ghantt into stealing money from the armored
truck company he works for and have him eliminated in Mexico after the
job. Dubbed the 'Loomis Fargo Bank Robbery' by the FBI, the real
incident turned out to be one of the largest cash hauls in the United
States. What happens in the film is a struggle between staying true to
the facts and letting Galifianakis loose.While most of the film barely serves any real laughs (when not being
cringe worthy awkward), the only reason to recommend Masterminds would
have to be cameos from Sudeikis as a psychotic hit-man and Kate
McKinnon as Ghantt's psychotic fiancé. Both are show stealers and with
the inclusion of Leslie Jones as a tongue-lashing FBI agent, perhaps
the only saving grace in a crime film disguised as a comedy. And
speaking of disguise, this film is second to none in imagining what a
wanted thief must do to evade airport security. Watch and laugh. Or
weep.",95,2016

333,8.25,5.4,"There are a lot of strong opinions on this film in its early reviews. I
just want to give a practical commentary on what I see. This is a great horror flick with some heavy symbolism. It is a story
about a mother and daughter who are terrorized by a monster when their
car gets stuck. A lot of dudes (or women haters) seem to hate it (check
the low reviews and notice the colorful words they have for women). As
a dude myself, I had no problem watching a film from a female
perspective. I rather enjoyed it and found it touching at times. The characters are both flawed. I related with the daughter at times
because I grew up with a flawed father. I acted and reacted a lot of
the ways the daughter in the film did too. So from my perspective,
there was some heavy realism in the backstory. I found the ""boring""
moments to be touching. The practical effects are superb in my opinion. Some will disagree
though. Some of the writing is flawed in regards to character choices. I think
discourse could answer some of the choices, but my fellow horror film
nerds seem to be either accepting or spiteful of cliché character fails
in the genre. I could see past them though for quality story though. So if you don't get angry being put in a woman's perspective and like
horror films, this should be right your alley.",91,2016

I found this film, it seemed like a good watch. Original? Not really,

but Jesus Christ, this movie failed to even reach a certain point of
quality. Alright, so, the goals they had set up for their ""summer of yes"" were
fulfilled in the first half hour! Yes, conflicts ensued, but they were
terribly timed. Film makers are allowed to do as they please, seeing
that film making is a form of art, but in order for that ""art"" to be
good, you do have to follow some rules of your craft. I just didn't see
any of them being executed in this movie. The cinematography and
screenplay were alright, but compared to other young adult films of the
same year, it falls short. To me, the only redeemable thing were the characters. Nora, Lion,
Spice, and Conch (yes, Conch) were fun to watch and seemed like cool
people. Andy, on the other hand got a lot more screen time than he
should have. He was not a nice person, and he was pretty selfish as
well. Bad characteristics don't always make a bad character, but in
this case, that doesn't apply. Moreover, the relationships that formed
in the end were so artificial, and I want to say predictable, but I
honestly didn't think they would dive straight into cliché dreamland,
so I was a bit taken aback. And what kind of teen movie doesn't have a cool soundtrack?2/10",86,2016

the person in the control room shouting 'I want eyes on every asset

337,8.0,6.8,"I first became aware of this film when Winona Ryder mentioned it as one of
her all-time favorite films in an interview with Timothy Leary. I found
that
no video copy of the film was on the market and it was rarely screened. I
knew right away it would have to be a truly great film to be ignored for 40
years by the same American movie-going public who turned Kazan's
ridiculously overrated ""On the Waterfront"" into a multi Oscar winner, gave
George Stevens an Oscar for the awful ""Giant,"" and made their greatest
director (Orson Welles), a commercial failure and an exile.Well I finally saw this thing yesterday, in pristine form and on the huge
screen of the Egyptian theatre in Hollywood, thanks to the American
Cinamateque, and all my suspicions and predictions were comfirmed: it's not
only a masterpiece but one of the most idiosyncratic American films ever
made; better than any pre-East-of-Eden Kazan film and featuring an
astounding performace from Carroll Baker, and a brilliantly bizzare and
understated one from Ralph Meeker. The film's pace is slow and methodical,
frustrating ALL audience expectations and conditioning in the best
Antonioni
style (you can clearly tell Garfein's seen ""L'Avventura"" and ""La Notte"" a
few times), and revealing insights and truths that would be completely
obzcured otherwise. Most of the film is fascinatingly shot on crowded New
York streets in a semi-neo-realist style using long takes and with the
modernist music of Aaron Copland providing an eerie counterpoint to the
visual mood. The cinematography is by Eugen Shuftan, the same guy who shot
Fritz Lang's famous silent film ""Metropolis"" and it's expressionistic to
the
max, providing further contrast and counterpoint, a 'poetic touch' to the
realistic method acting employed in the film.Some people might think that the entire film is absurd and no rape victim
would refuse to say anything about her rape and then fall in love and marry
a crazy mechanic who locks her in an apartment, but they forget one point:
Meeker doesn't know (because he was drunk out of his mind) that he violated
Baker's trust and when Baker mentions that she was the one who kicked him
in
the eye, he realizes his inpropriety, becomes patient, and leaves the door
unlocked. Furthermore, the reason Meeker locks Baker in the room in the
beginning is partly to prevent her from another 'blacked-out' suicide
attempt, because he loves her and doesn't want to lose her. And the
objection of 'rape victims who never report their rape are unrealistic' is
ridiculous on its face; everyone knows from statistics that it is an
unoforunate and all too common occurence, maybe even especially more so
when
the girl raped is beautiful enough to be said to be 'provoking' men. So the
entire film is completely valid on its face and thoroughly realistc. But
what makes it great are the little touches and details, the time taken to
capture the nuances of acting and location that other films don't make the
effort for. One can only hope that Jack Garfein (the director, who was
married to Carroll Baker at the time) makes the further effort of getting
MGM/UA or whoever owns the original negative of this film, to transfer it
to
a good DVD to give people a chance to rediscover one of the great American
films some 40 years after its initial release to commerical failure:

her Soviet boss, Vasyl (Jack Davenport) is also romantically committed
to her and does not take kindly to the dalliance. We also have the
brilliant Burn Gorman playing a NKVD agent who is deliciously ruthless

genre - a fungus spreads out in the world and transforms the humans to
flesh craving numb-heads. We follow some scientists, a girl who has
maybe the potential to cure the world and some soldiers in a world out
of control. Well done are some scenes and settings which depict the
feel of a desolated world very good, also we get some iconic scenes
with the transforming crazies. What else!? Gemma Arterton and Glen
Close can't act bad. But I have to say the last quarter of the movie including the solution
was a little bit too much of a let down to me. For example the scene
where the little girl defends Gemma and a soldier against a horde of
hungry crazy kids is so out of place and bad executed I couldn't help
myself and felt embarrassed for the cast, for the director, for my self
- this scene (I guess you will understand me if you watch/watched the
movie) is laughable, a total mess and it shows harsh the other weak
point of the movie - the abilities of the girl actor are too restricted
and if she got for a longer time into the focus of the play/camera it
shows hard (as the girl grunted against the other kids I didn't know if
I should laugh or cry out for mercy - it is even more bad as some of
that kiddo stuff in Mad Max III). So The Girl with All the Gifts is a
good movie regarding the first three quarters, after that the movie
loses its quality - rapidly. So 28 Days Later is still the supreme master of the
fast-running-whatever-flesh-craving-maniacs-genre. This one is a nice
try, but not more. First 3 quarters get a 7-8 from me, the last quarter

What I mean by that is a movie needs to be rated on the
investment/production value as well as entertainment.Let me explain; Let's take Barber Shop 2 as an example (that has a 5.9
average). It has how many top rated actors (how many DON'T you know?)
as well as a 20 million budget (which went where exactly?). Yet it was
boring, biased, stupid, NOT funny etc...Now take this movie... I didn't recognize any actors, budget was
clearly low as it wasn't even disclosed, yet the story line was great,
acting was good, the scenery was amazing, and I was pleasantly
entertained!If a movie has a high budget with A-list actors and top
directors/producers and is terrible, it deserves a low score. But going into a movie that is a B type movie with no name actors (of

me to write my first review. Mainly because of the disturbing amount of
reviews of people who just don't seem to understand what they've been
watching. Before watching this movie I knew nothing about it, just
found it on the new releases on Netflix.Operation Avalanche is a low-budged retro styled (late sixties) found
footage movie by Matt Johnson. Though it is a mystery-thriller movie,
it also has elements of a documentary and even some comedy. The film
aims to build a realistic, lively background story for the alleged
filming of the fake moon landing footage. It incorporates some of the
moon landing skeptics' (or conspiracy thinkers) most cherished
arguments and theories. Like for instance the link with Stanley
Kubrick. The use of stock footage from his sets of 2001: A Space
Odyssey was one of my favorite moments in the movie. From Wikipedia: 'The NASA scenes were shot on location. To get
permission, Johnson told them he was making a student documentary.
Additional scenes were accomplished through liberal application of
newly-permissive fair use laws.' That's what I call brave. Though I found Johnson's vision wild, yet well established - many have
mocked this movie for basically not understanding it. This is not a
conspiracy movie. This is not simple entertainment. It's a piece of
art, historical poetry - albeit the history of the greatest conspiracy
of all. Furthermore the movie uses all cinematographic tricks to warn
us of those very same tricks. It distorts reality with realistic
looking (historical) footage as a way to educate us on how we could
actually be manipulated by films. Even halve a century later. Some blame the movie for being badly filmed. Or even amateurish. The
handling of the camera is some of the best I've ever seen! That car
chase scene must surely be one of the best in cinematic history. All in
one single shot. The Cinematography by Raab and Apelle is one of the
most noteworthy of everything I've seen in the last years. Showing how
photographic images can be faked  in mere seconds. Showing us
Kubrick's front screen projection technology and its use; just a
background scene in this movie. Outstanding! The sets on which the fake
moon landing footage is made in the movie are great as well. Everyone
knows these classic shots from the original NASA moon landing footage.
Lovely to see these shots recreated within the framework of found
footage thriller. The acting, which is said to be the result of improvisation, of the
directer himself and a small cast of unknown actors is lively. Standout
in the found footage genre I'd say. It doesn't even look like acting,
just like actual historical footage. Conclusion. By far the best and most relevant found footage movie ever
made. Entertaining, educational and exciting  especially for those who
really like the profession and technology of film making. It is also
the best ode to the work of Stanley Kubrick in any film  and mind you,
there are many such examples.",94,2016

everyone's taste. I am not a professional critic but to me this is

and many unexpected moments. I do think it gave up a couple of its
secrets a touch to early, but I don't believe that detracts from the
overall story.There is suspense and action, and some pretty gory outcomes along the
path to the conclusion. And there are at least 3 wtf moments while all
that plays out.Overall, I really enjoyed. I live for action movies, but they don't all
have to be over-the-top massive cgi efforts. This was more grounded
action but for me very enjoyable nonetheless.This movie made me think of Get the Gringo with Mel Gibson from a

as the gang in the press room and the lines they toss back and forth at
each other are priceless. Even better were some of the lines at the
expense of the self important political and law enforcement figures
they cover.I suppose it's the nature of the job that makes newsmen cynical. But
this group takes it to an exponential level. Frank Capra did something
very similar in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. When newly appointed
interim Senator James Stewart arrives in town and they make him out a
buffoon, Stewart goes around punching out all of them he can find. When
he does reach the Capitol Press Room, the whole group of them Thomas
Mitchell, Jack Carson, Charles Lane, etc. bring him up quite short.
That group of correspondents could easily have been in the press room
in The Front Page. I have no doubt that Capra was inspired by
Milestone's work in The Front Page.The casting of the leads is quite a story. Pat O'Brien had played
Walter Burns on stage and someone in the Howard Hughes organization got
their wires crossed and signed him for Hildy Johnson. O'Brien made the
switch effortlessly though. Lewis Milestone originally wanted Louis Wolheim with whom he'd worked
the year before in All Quiet on the Western Front. But then Wolheim
died suddenly right before filming was to start. Adolphe Menjou was
hurriedly substituted and he proved to be an inspired choice.When The Front Page was done on the Broadway stage the roles of Johnson
and Burns were played by Lee Tracy and Osgood Perkins. I could see
either of them in their respective parts. Both got to Hollywood, but
too late to do either part for the screen.The two female roles of note were Johnson's fiancé Peggy and the
streetwalker who had befriended convicted killer George E. Stone who's
execution the reporters are covering. Mae Clarke as the prostitute is
just fine. A tough year for Mae, she jumps through a window here and
gets slugged with a grapefruit later on in Public Enemy.Mary Brian is the fiancé and in an underwritten part, she's dull as
dishwater. Not her fault because the film is about the guys. But seeing
this, no wonder Howard Hawks got the inspired idea to eliminate her,
create THE Ralph Bellamy part and make Hildy Johnson a woman for His
Girl Friday.Of course The Front Page has the look and feel of the era that birthed
it. But the portrait of newspapermen is still fresh and the issues
raised about crooked politicians running on ""law and order"" platforms
is probably even more relevant today than back then.",101,1931
352,10.0,7.5,"This is not a large scale multi-million dollar epic of World War Two.
No thousands of extras, no wide panoramic sweep of battle scenes. This
says more about The Battle of the Bulge than the movie of the same
name. It's just an ordinary black and white M.G.M. production. What it
lacks in size and scope it makes up for in impact.A simple story very
well told, of a squad of GI's of the 101st Airborne Division, thrown
into the maelstrom that was the German offensive in the Ardennes in
December of 1944 against the Allied ground forces. It's hard to believe that this film was not shot on location; but on a
Metro sound stage. And Metro's Culver City was turned into the only
outdoor location for the snow-covered, rubble-strewn town of Bastogne
under siege, which was tenaciously held by the 101st, under the command
of Brig. General Anthony McAuliffe. With the exception of Van Johnson as Pvt. Holly who was high profile on
the Metro lot in his time, and George Murphy as Pvt. Stazak, the rest
of the cast were character-type actors who filled their roles
perfectly. James Whitmore as Sgt. Kinnie is drilling the squad in the
opening scenes. The squad members talk of an enjoyable furlough in Paris which is
suddenly cut short by the German breakthrough in the Ardenne. Ptv.
Stazak hopes of going home are dashed because his authorised documents
have not come through before the squad moves up front. Douglas Fowley
as Pvt. Kippton seems to be the best in the squad at bellyaching.Maybe
it's his dentures that make him a sourpuss. But Fowley's dentures turn
into a class act; clicking away to the old song, ""I Surrender Dear,""
through the courtesy of a German propaganda broadcast heard over the
radio in a Sherman tank. Denise Darcel comes as a welcome relief of
feminine pleasure; not out of place in the town of Bastogne itself. In
an indoor scene, Pvt. Holly's eyeballs go into left-to-right overdrive
as he stares at Denise's buxom rear end descending a flight of stairs.
Then there's Holly again, nursing stolen newly-laid eggs, as valuable
as gold nuggets. He's about to scramble them over a fire when the squad
is told to saddle up and move out. Not for the first time does Johnson
(Pvt. Holly) yell, ""oh no!"" A expression he's used in past movies also.
The broken eggs in his upturned helmet are now a problem. In the end
it's disaster. The German artillery scramble the eggs for Holly.
Problem solved! On a three man patrol, Holly, Hodiak as Janness, Montalban as
Rodriguez, intercept and force a jeep carrying a Major and two
sergeants to stop and identify themselves. The knowledge that Germans
are infiltrating in GI uniforms has made the patrol suspicious so the
Major is asked how the Dodgers made out in 1944. The Major
hesitates,but the Sergeant in the rear seat asks Holly who Betty Grable
is married to. Montalban shouts back, ""Cesar Romero"". The Major says
Romero is out. ""Betty Grable is married to Harry James"". The tense
atmosphere relaxes. The patrol is convinced they're friendly. What is displayed authentically on this studio sound stage is the icy,
bone-chilling atmosphere of the battlefield. The men hunkered down; the
deeper the better, in their foxholes. Throughout nearly all this movie
there is the constant rise and fall in the background of continuous
artillery fire, like a rolling thunder. It never seems to cease.
Sometimes it's close, sometimes distant. That, along with the freezing
fog hanging like a thick whitish-grey blanket in the air, enveloping
everything, gives off an atmosphere of crisis; a feeling of fearful
tension. The men endeavour to dispel the fear with humour. Waiting and
wondering when the enemy will appear ghost-like out of the
mist-shrouded forest. Near the end of the movie, Leon Ames gives a good performance as a Army
Chaplain. Trying to explain the reason for this necessary trip to
Europe, to kill off a murderous political system that has already
killed off millions. Before the end, the tables turn in the Allies
favour. Sergeant Kinnie notices his shadow against the snow. The sun is
breaking through and the mist rises. Allied tactical air power is back
in business again with a vengeance.Veteran director William Wellman was not found wanting when he directed
this movie. He had already proved himself with, ""The Story of GI Joe"",
in 1945. Antiwar film? Any war film well made and convincing can be
antiwar, and you do not need blood all over the silver screen to prove
it. Antiwar or not, World War Two was a ""popular"" war. The reasons
stuck out a mile. The Army Chaplain said so in so many words. The Ardennes offensive caught the Allies unawares, in short, too
cocksure. By late 1944, battered the German forces may have been. But
they still had a few nasty shots in their locker to scare the living
daylights out of the Allied Command. The allies paid the penalty in
lost ground and casualties for General Eisenhower's insistence for a
broad front advance. We thought the Germans had run out of fighting
steam, but old Field Marshal Karl Rudolf Gerd Von Rundstedt thought
different!",118,1949
353,8.0,5.5,"Yes, yes. Actually, I encountered this movie first as a ""comic book based on

impression on me! (Money well-spent from my paper route). Anyway, the part I
like best is where the Atlanteans are making men into beasts by grafting
snouts and horns onto them. Impressive!
I can't work out whether its ""Island of Dr Moreau meets Ulysses"" or
""Pinochhio meets Jason and the Argonauts"". However, all of that doesn't
really matter. Let's just say they don't make em like this no more. Stiff,

354,11.0,7.2,"Sometimes a good movie blows you away from the get-go. This one took
the light of the next day. Carol Reed cleverly disguises his picture
with post war intrigue and ambiguous alliances / conspiracies in the
first half, but this is ultimately at its heart the story of an
impossible romance attempted at an impossible time. While it takes a
good half of the movie to get to the real plot, once it cooks, it
sizzles. The extended chase sequence in the last third of the movie
probably tops the far more famous THE THIRD MAN, though it is a little
less frantic and far more deliberately cat and mouse.All of the cast is excellent, including the fetching and intriguing
blonde wife, the mysterious young bicyclist, and the rotund, scheming
elder German kidnapper. Leads James Mason and Claire Bloom (never
prettier or sexier) have amazing chemistry as the picture develops, and
one really wishes they had gotten together an hour earlier, because
this is the heart of the matter and the meat of the movie.Another major star of this movie is the location photography. The light
and shadows draped on the characters flitting in and out of the jagged
yet beautiful exo-skeletel ruins and debris of the once-glorious,
cosmopolitan city of Berlin are hypnotic and amazing. The
cinematography is remarkable; there is great POV work of the
snow-covered kidnap vehicle stalking Bloom, but even better camera
angles and lighting creativity in the bravura chase in the last 20
minutes (shockingly good given this film's relative anonymity.) This isn't THE THIRD MAN or ODD MAN OUT, but it contains most of the
best elements of each movie, plus a better romance than either of
those. Interesting that Claire Bloom is forced to watch helplessly as
James Mason is shot down at the end of MAN BETWEEN. Only about eight
years later she would share the same fate at a similar location on the
Berlin border in the searing THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. A
heartbreaking must for fans of postwar noir, Mason or Bloom.",100,1953

engrossing, gripping and captivating for most cinema goers these days I
believe. The Light Between Oceans is one such movie! I did not expect
it to be so absorbing when I chose to watch it while having a day off.
I just thought it could be a bit boring as the story is based on a
faraway light house. But at the end I was glued in to my seat
spellbound by its infinite beauty and strength; quite pleasantly
captivated by the terrific acting of Alicia Vikander and Michael
Fassbender. Particularly Alicia truly lives in the character and
wouldn't let your mind roam anywhere else with her gripping acting. She
makes it so real and emotional that you feel that it's you who is
inside her character. I was just thinking how lucky we are that Alicia
came to this world to make us so fulfilled with her spellbinding
acting! One of the best scenes displayed with utmost acting talent was
the scene Tom agreeing to Isabel's plea to adopt the child, keeping the
incident a secret. The facial expressions and the body language of both
Tom and Isabella are so natural and intense in those few minutes, you
could be frozen to your seat! It's torturing your soul actually, but
that's the way a good character should be acted. Fassbender plays the
role equally well too, a character well displayed with his identical
razor sharp eye and intense facial expressions. He needs no extra
effort to play such a complex character as he is born with such
fascinating acting talents. Rachel Weiz does justice to her role well
but I believe her character belongs to a younger actress to match the
story. You get to see great cinematography by Arkapov in such beauty
that captures spellbinding New Zealand landscape at its best. It rhymes
well with the melancholic music by Desplat. Last but not least I had
never watched a movie by Derek Cianfrance before but he simply has done
smart work by directing this ingenious epic. My only disappointment is towards the end of the movie, as the final
scene building loses its momentum. When Tom is in remand the characters
begin to lose cohesiveness a bit but it sinks further deep after he was
sent to the jail. Within the next five or ten minutes Isabel passes
away, Lucy is suddenly grown up and become a mother too. That hastiness
really smashes the beautiful rhythm so well built up throughout the
movie. All in all it's an enthralling and engrossing cinematic experience that
you will never regret watching!!However, I wouldn't be surprised at all if this movie did not get ANY

holes in the storyline and the acting isn't fantastic, especially when
the boyfriend drops down hung from bedsheets out of nowhere and the
reaction from all present is as if to carry on as if nothing happened.

lives. Tim Jones is an accomplished travel writer, and his wife, Natalie, is a

orphans. The Gaffneys soon find themselves in the centre of international
espionage that gives them a glimpse of life outside their comfort
zone.........Keeping Up With The Joneses is one of those comedies that offers
absolutely nothing new to the genre of comedy, and basically borrows
from films that are a lot better than this, and funnily enough, a lot
worse.If this was made in the eighties, it would have starred Steve Martin
and Shelly Long as the atypical suburban couple, and probably Michael
Douglas and Kathleen Turner as the titular couple, and it would have
been an absolute smash, because it would have felt relatively fresh.Jump forward thirty years, and with films like Mr & Mrs. Smith,
Killers, Housesitter, and a never ending plethora of fish out of water
comedies, it feels stale, well worn, and relies on the star power of
the cast.The thing is, Galfiniakas is way out of his comfort zone playing the
Everyman, and Gal Gadot is incredibly wooden in her role. So much in
fact, it's setting the alarm bells ringing for Wonder Woman.So the couple get into scrapes, find a little excitement in their
mundane lives, and just like True Lies, assist in the final 'hilarious'
act when special guest star Patton Oswald makes his appearance as the
end of game bad guy.But it isn't a terrible film, there are a couple of amusing moments,
and Fisher plays the jittery housewife with panache, but you can't see
those two as a couple.If you want a comedy that is safe, and offers nothing new, then you may

plausible that it might be better then the ratings tell I give it a

362,11.2,6.5,"""The Girl on a Train"" is the film adaptation of the best-seller by
Paula Hawkins, transported from the London suburbs to New York's
Hastings-on- Hudson.It's actually rather a sordid story encompassing as it does alcoholism,
murder, marital strife, deceit, sexual frustration, an historical
tragedy and lashings and lashings of violence. Emily Blunt (""Sicario"",
""Edge of Tomorrow"") plays Rachel, a divorcée with an alcohol problem
who escapes into an obsessive fantasy each day as she passes her former
neighbourhood on her commute into the city. Ex-husband Tom (Justin
Theroux, ""Zoolander 2"") lives in her old house with his second wife
Anna (Rebecca ""MI:5"" Ferguson) and new baby Evie. But her real fantasy
rests with cheerleader- style young neighbour Megan (Haley Bennett) who
is actually locked in a frustratingly child-free marriage (frustrating
for him at least) with the controlling and unpredictable Scott (Luke
Evans, ""The Hobbit""). A sixth party in this complex network is Megan's
psychiatrist Dr Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez, ""Joy"").In pure Hitchcockian style Megan witnesses mere glimpses of events from
her twice-daily train and from these pieces together stories that
suitably feed her psychosis. When 'shit gets real' and a key character
goes missing, Megan surfaces her suspicions and obsessions to the
police investigation (led by Detective Riley, the ever-excellent
Allison Janney from ""The West Wing"") and promptly makes herself suspect
number one.Readers of the book will already be aware of the twists and turns of
the story, so will watch the film from a different perspective than I
did. (Despite my best intentions I never managed to read the book
first).First up, you would have to say that Emily Blunt's performance is
outstanding in an extremely challenging acting role. Every nuance of
shame, confusion, grief, fear, doubt and anger is beautifully enacted:
it would not be a surprise to see her gain her first Oscar nomination
for this. All the other lead roles are also delivered with great
professionalism, with Haley Bennett (a busy month for her, with ""The
Magnificent Seven"" also out) being impressive and Rebecca Ferguson, one
of my favourite current actresses, delivering another measured and
delicate performance.The supporting roles are also effective, with Darren Goldstein as the
somewhat creepy ""man in the suit"" and ""Friends"" star Lisa Kudrow
popping up in an effective and pivotal role. The Screen Guild Awards
have an excellent category for an Ensemble Cast in a Motion Picture,
and it feels appropriate to nominate this cast for that award.So it's a blockbuster book with a roller-coaster story and a stellar
cast, so what could go wrong? Well, something for sure. This is a case
in point where I suspect it is easier to slowly peel back Rachel's lost
memory with pages and imagination than it is with dodgy fuzzy images on
a big screen. Although the film comes in at only 112 minutes, the
pacing in places is too slow (the screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson
takes its time) and director Tate Taylor (""The Help"") is no Hitchcock,
or indeed a David Fincher (since the film has strong similarities to
last year's ""Gone Girl"": when the action does happen it lacks style,
with the violence being on the brutal side and leaving little to the
imagination.It's by no means a bad film, and worth seeing for the acting
performances alone. But it's not a film I think that will trouble my
top 10 for the year.(Agree? Disagree? For the graphical version of this review and to

Director, David Hartman's glimpse into the bizarre and fantastical
world of the ""Phantasm"" series in this disjointed but entertaining
final chapter in a long-time saga of weirdness and mayhem. This is the
first of the ""Phantasm"" films that is not directed by originator, Don
Coscarelli and the final performance of the late and great Angus Scrimm
as the ""Tall Man"" who passed away at age 89 in 2016. He returns along
with much of the original cast of the ""Phantasm"" films including:
Reggie Banister, Michael Baldwin, Bill Thornbury, Kelly Lester, Gloria
Lynne Henry and the awesome '71 Cuda as they battle the evil army of
graveroobbers that continue to populate the countryside with
living-dead dwarfs, zombies and of course, the dreaded silver spheres.
Its been 17 years since ""Phantasm IV"" and this picks up where that film
left off, but with a significantly older Reggie Banister wandering the
mid-west after his subsequent escape from the ""Tall Man"" and his
minions. Don't fret since it has been a while since the film's opening
quickly recaps the basic highlights of previous films including
Phantasm IV's revealing of the identity and origins of the ""Tall Man"",
Morningside Cemetery and the mystery of the flying spheres. This falls short of everything you would expect from a continuation of
the Phantasm saga, but as a long time fan its nice to hear that
original Fred Myrow/Malcolm Seagrave musical score that once again sets
the mood for this outstandingly strange world. Ultimately, this
utilizes the fact that the original characters are at the mercy of old
age and lost time, especially Reggie as he is diagnosed with dementia,
institutionalized and cannot tell the difference between nightmare and
reality and must reprise everything he already experienced and more.
The final moments of Angus Scrimm combined with Reggie's journey into
past reflections are handled quite well by director/writer, David
Hartman whom you can tell is a devoted fan of the series. Presumably,
this is on a modest budget, but that is no surprise, and it seems to
contribute to the comic relief and overall ambiance of the film. The
problems with this movie arise with Reggie's memories and whether or
not they corroborate the events in the story, as this is the whole
point and meaning of ""Phantasm"". What may be conceived of as real may
not be, and what is remembered may just be a glimpse into an alternate
reality. Are Reggie's memories just another attempt by the Tall Man to
destroy him, or will he actually reunite with his friends Mike and Jody
and defeat the Tall Man once and for all? Its inevitably a battle
between Reggie's blurred fantasy of world domination as he struggles
between dreams and reality. The film is definitely flawed, Dawn Cody is
terrible as the female interest and Angus Scrimm's character is
obviously transposed into many scenes from the older prints. Cheap CGI
effects are evident and the last half hour is so confusing and
pointless leaving no closure to the overall story except a messy and
convoluted ending, but as a fan, its nice to see the cast reunited, and
some fresh ideas. Its too bad it took so long to materialize this final
chapter and why they couldn't perfect it due to so many production and
writing difficulties which are obvious. Its not satisfying, but I had
some fun with it for what it is.. I guess its up to the fans to decide
after all these years whether or not it can hold a candle to its
predecessors. Not great, but can't say I found it completely worthless.

368,6.0,5.8,"Comedian Kevin Hart's career to date has been a mixed bag. He has made
millions laugh with his stand-up act (in comedy clubs and on tour), on
television and in the movies  sometimes as a supporting character and
sometimes as the star  including, of course, his concert films
featuring his stand-up. He has written and produced for TV and movies
(mostly, but not exclusively, for himself). His comedy projects have
consistently made handsome profits, but have received mixed reviews
from critics and, in some cases, audiences. As someone who tries to
maintain the balance between movie reviewer and Movie Fan, here's how I
see Kevin Hart's effectiveness in some of his films: ""Grudge Match"",
""The Wedding Ringer"", ""Get Hard""  funny. ""Ride Along"", ""Ride Along 2"",
""Central Intelligence""  mildly amusing. His 2016 concert movie ""Kevin
Hart: What Now?"" (R, 1:36)  not funny. Please, let me explain.Kevin Hart's 2016 concert film opens with a significant, but irrelevant
sequence in which he plays a James Bond type of character (opposite
Halle Berry) and participates in a high-stakes poker game, a la Daniel
Craig's first Bond outing, ""Casino Royale"". In this opener for Hart's
film (basically a movie within a movie), production values are high and
the acting is good (including cool cameos by Don Cheadle and others),
but there are few laughs and the whole thing has almost nothing to do
with what comes next.After his spy adventure, Hart appears at a packed Lincoln Financial
Field (home of the NFL's Eagles) in Philadelphia where he performs his
usual type of stand-up routine  with some social and political
commentary and a whole lot of stories and jokes based on his family
life and other personal experiences  all infused with his signature
brand of physical comedy. Most of his jokes come from how ridiculous he
thinks the members of his family are  and what people would be like if
they were deprived of various parts of their body (e.g. arms and legs,
shoulders, etc.) due to a variety of extraordinary mishaps.Of course, this being a comedy concert film, there are plenty of shots
of people in the crowd laughing at Hart's antics and repeating some of
the lines he uses. He performs with nothing but a mic and a stool, but
is backed up by large video screens with images illustrating some of
the stories he tells. Then, at the end of his routine, there's a brief
scene in which Hart picks up where he left off with Halle Berry and
seems to be teasing a future project  basically answering the question
posed in his concert film's title.The movie commits the greatest possible sin of a comedy concert film 
not being very funny. The laughs from Hart's live audience were seldom
echoed in the crowded theater where I saw the movie. No wonder. Comedy
usually plays better in person than on a screen  and people are more
primed to enjoy comedy the more time and money they spend to see it (as
in, the cost of a live show that you went to in a large venue, versus a
cheaper ticket in a comparatively small movie theater), but the main
problem with this film is the comedy itself. Hart talks at length about
far-fetched situations that are more bizarre than funny. He also refers
to his family members (father, children and fiancé) in ways that are
more disrespectful than humorous. What's more, much like in his movies,
Hart relies too much on his over-the-top facial expressions for laughs.

cast and characters with the basic storyline, but that did not expand
and explored well as it should have been. At least the pace of the
narration looked fine. Some characters looked unnecessary, and so a
couple of scenes. If these all were managed, then still it could have
been a decent film. Because since it is an action- adventure, they did
not generate those crucial parts like the stunts and dialogues related
to the gangster thing to turn it a better film in its kind.The two veteran actors coming together for the first time added more
curiosity than flavour we are looking for. They did okay and so the
rest of the cast. Ideal runtime, a few stuffs were in the favour of the
film, but those were not enough for the overall success. If the same
film was made from the non-English world like perhaps Germany, which
was one of the producers of the film would have done better than this
existing one which is very familiar with this language.People would watch it only for Hopkins and Kingley and so did am I. But
they might end in disappointment, or that could be the reason to rate
it fairly better. Whatever, this is an okay film, which is barely
entertaining and of all, not a boring film. So trying it for one is
okay, but I think not worth if you have got plenty of options over this

371,9.0,5.9,"Follow-up to 1967's ""Tony Rome"" is saddled with a tired plot concerning
a murdered blonde in Florida and the investigation led by detective
Frank Sinatra. Movie gets a much-needed shot in the arm from sexy
Raquel Welch as a wealthy woman indirectly involved (she makes her
entrance emerging from a swimming pool--bikini clad of course!).
Sinatra himself looks rather weary and impatient, tossing off jaded
quips without any subtlety, but there are two great supporting
performances: Dan Blocker as a shady character fond of twisting heads
around and Lainie Kazan as a go-go girl (she has just one smoky
sequence, and it's a killer). Otherwise, pretty rote. **1/2 from ****",93,1968

mainly because of the cast, except hottie Daddario. Yeah, I was
interested in this because of none other than her, otherwise a
skippable film. But the story was good. Not the greatest one, though
for this kind of production, it fared well. And I think you should
expect similarly to get a better experience out of it.This is the story of a geek who has a decent life with a well paid job.
It is until a girl enters his life, which changes forever. He discovers
the alternate way to cope with what he'd lost recently. And his
romantic life going to be doomed even before getting it started with a
most beautiful woman he had ever dreamed of. So what comes further
explains his future from all the aspects of his life.I thought it would be a bakery related theme as I misread the title.
Sometimes that's good, because to overtake over expectations. Good
performances by all the cast, but like I said Alexandra Daddario could
be the reason for many like me to have a peek on this film and it is
worth apart from that case. You might see it rated average, but I think
it is much better than that if you are honest with your experience of
watching it. Surely once watchable film.6/10",86,2016

374,19.666666666666668,5.1,"""The past can define our future. But I won't let it.""The opening scene of this sci-fi horror was promising. Even better, it
was a snapshot that instantly caught my attention. A sublime and
fascinating scene after which I snuggled in my cozy chair in
anticipation for something magnificent. I was immediately convinced
that this was going to be a hell of a movie. What did you expect? With
a score like that on IMDb, this couldn't go wrong. The frozen image of
a puzzled looking girl smeared with blood, seamlessly merged with a
TV-show where we get the melancholic picture of a generation with no
future. The education system needs to be changed so a new generation of
intelligent young kids is being produced instead of a generation of
obese and hopeless youngsters . The images looked futuristic with a
suitable graphic design. And then the flashy google glass lookalike is
introduced. A gadget we'll be watching through the rest of the film.Just recently I've seen ""Jeruzalem"" where they used the same kind of
glasses. A disappointing film though. The only feat I was excited about
was that high-tech device. Unfortunately this facet of ""Let's be evil""
became a rather annoying element to me. Even worse. I got so sick of it
that I wanted to give up already halfway the movie. The rickety
soundtrack was perhaps an omen. Admit it. If you want to create a
futuristic movie, you shouldn't be using those stale Jean
Michelle-Jarre polyphonic sounds. It felt as if I was watching a
third-rate SF from the 80s. Unfortunately these weren't the only
disturbing elements. When the end credits rolled over the screen I made
my final conclusion. This was probably the worst thing I've seen this
year.First, the overall picture you get to see almost the whole movie. The
fact that it all happens in a virtual environment (the three selected
candidates can only see by making use of the spectacles) was at first
an exciting and interesting display. It all looked great and well-known
(especially for those who sometimes sit behind a screen to have fun
with some PC games), but it has one major drawback. After half an hour
of hazy and swirling images, you gradually start to hate it. Biggest
advantage is that a not so talented cameraman with virtually no
experience gets away with it when some blurry and out of focus
fragments appear in between. Combine this with a dark underground
bunker where the lighting consists of pulsating lights in all sorts of
colors and your irritation level is reached very quickly. It looked as
if the whole story was set in a concrete submarine.And then you have the actors who were recruited based on some unknown
requirements and who are participating in the Posterity Project.
Judging from the conversations they have, the requirements concerning
the level of intelligence needed for this job wasn't very high. Their
ultimate function is to observe the group of teenagers that are also
present in this underground facility (spending their days waving their
hands in the air). And when necessary they accompany a lost teenager
back to the group. Not exactly intriguing and exciting. The fact that
the group of children organize a sort of artificial uprising afterwards
in which they manipulate the electronic system in an incomprehensible
way, was the start of a confusing outcome and a ridiculous denouement.Finally, the part that frustrated me the most. I had no idea what the
theme of this movie was about. And in the end, I still didn't know it.
Perhaps it's me getting older and a mild version of dementia sneaked in
my system, but I couldn't make head nor tail of it. What was the
opening sequence about and how did this correlate with the rest of the
movie? And the end didn't clarify anything either. In a subtle way they
tried to demonstrate the dangers of technologies and the way it's
intertwined in our everyday lives. Kind of obvious. But eventually I
still had a few questions about the film. Occasionally I like to watch
a sophisticated film with a not so simple story line. But this was a
level too high for me apparently. I suggest however that the creators
of the IMDb website check their algorithms, because the score given to
""Let's be Evil"" is totally irrational. Or was there an artificial
intervention by the makers of this movie? Well, that's a spooky
thought!More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",82,2016

it is so much more. In reality the film is about family, and you won't
realize that at first.The script is so well crafted this film should be used in writing
classes. I guarantee you will not know what's coming, and after they

Bernthal really stand out, and for Bernthal it is a change of pace and
he carries it off very well. Jeffrey Tambor, John Lithgow and Jean

and an enormous home library consisting of many historical books from
all periods in American and World history, I have a fond knack for this
particular subject.Unfortunately 2016's ""Birth of A Nation"" mostly disappoints. This film
feels more like a made for TV movie than a big budget film. The
dialogue felt contrived and the movie was plagued with too many
clichés. The film also ignores the darker side of the slave rebellion,
in which women and children became innocent victims, along with the
plantation owners.Birth of a Nation basically paints Nat Turner has an unquestionable
hero, yet the real Nat Turner - if you've ever read any history -
probably wouldn't be considered as a hero by the vast majority of
modern people, considering some of his questionable actions during the
rebellion that left women and children slaughtered.There wasn't really much of an impact on me by the end of the film, and
I think the film mostly fails to give the viewer a clear or unique
message. In the end, the film mostly feels like a waste of resources.

and anything would do. So I went to see Middle School as it was playing
at the time I showed up. I herd of the movie, I did not have low
expectations, and did not have any exceptions.So what I got is a very entertaining movie. This genre of movie has
never peaked my interest, so I was real surprised how much I actually
liked it. It's pretty funny. A lot of good jokes that I generally
enough to appeal to a large variety of people. A few laugh out loud
moments, and a lot of small ones that really keep the momentum going. This is despite the fact that the cast of characters was pretty generic
and mediocre, except for one named Georgia, the little sister of the
main character Rafe. Should have been more of her on the screen. Was also surprised at how deep the movie got. It's main plot of letting
children be creative individuals did not spark much inside me, but the
subplots of dealing with the lost of a family member did hit home, and
was delivered perfectly.Plus, there was some cool animation in it, and I'm a sucker for that. Overall Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life was worth the ticket.
It makes me feel differently about movies like this overall.",92,2016

I was out before 30 minutes, and the only reason I lasted that long was
because I wanted to like it. I hoped it would get better.

rarely gets better.Second, it seems like populism is the result of all of this social
media combined with widely available, easily affordable Audio-Visual

shots were brilliant, and the atmosphere, tension, and the excellent

heroine was a total idiot.She burns him with a cigarette lighter for like five seconds, thinks
hes dead, doesn't bother to pick up his knife and finish him off, and
goes back inside the house into a room with no other escape and starts
calling 911. Why didn't she get in one of the four operating vehicles
on the premises and leave? There were FOUR cars on that lot, all
working, and then when the killer corners her back in the house, she
refuses to jump out the huge window beside her, and backs into a corner
to meet her fate.Honestly, that ruined the entire thing for me. The blond girl is also

woods"" simulator. What I received was a couple of American teenagers
getting picked off one by one by the supernatural - as usual in low
effort horrors.The Blair Witch Project (1999) was good, because it was trying to be
realistic. Heather, Josh and Michael for all their faults weren't
lacking chromosomes, unlike the protagonists of the sequel/reboot. James, Lisa, Ashley, Peter, Lane and Talia - each one of them makes 12
y.o children look like master tacticians. One terribly stupid decision
follows another.Let me kick around parts of my tent, because I'm a choleric who can't
put it up in 5 minutes. Let me just go gather firewood alone, in the
middle of the night, losing line of sight with the camp. Let me climb
this tree, even though I could barely stand 10 minutes ago, because of
the fever and leg wounds. See a creepy dolls hanging around? Oh, look
at this one - not only it looks like a human being, but also it has
some hair of this crying, scared out of her wits girl. I see no reason
I shouldn't snap it in half, dealing with a witch and all.When I saw the preparations - GPS, drones, portable radios I thought I
was in for a great, well-written story that despite the wonders of
technology will show how helpless a man can be versus nature (and a
curse). I wasn't wrong about the last part, but I didn't expect the
witch to be a REC-zombie rip-off walking EMP. You know that electronic
devices known for their reliability in survival situations? They don't
work anymore. Why? F*** you, that's why.It's extremely hard to watch. I considered leaving the theater
mid-session, because I felt insulted by just watching it, but I managed
to endure it to the end.I felt relief when the last survivor got picked off the same way her
friend was few seconds ago. She SAW it happen and then she did the same
thing herself nonetheless. ""I'm free now"" I thought ""and nothing of
value was lost"".The only reason I didn't grade it with 1 star, is because of my respect

383,9.75,6.6,"Since seeing this film I've never been comfortable with Denis Leary as
a comedian because he's so damn convincing as the cold-hearted bad guy
in this. I think he's a great actor but this is the movie to see him in
as it's A. His best performance and B. One of the best villains ever in
movies.Leary plays Fallon, a dangerous criminal from Chicago's bad side. And
when four middle class pals from the quiet suburbs cross him and
witness a murder a chase across derelict landscapes follows. The
spoon-fed quartet are way out of their comfort zone and have no idea
how to navigate the ghetto or deal with its dwellers. Peter Greene, an
actor always like to see, plays Sykes, one of Fallon's cohorts as well
as Everlast from the rap group House of Pain as Rhodes. They sure do
make a threatening impression.Judgment Night kind of comes across as a modern, urban Deliverance.
There are many similarities between them but Judgment Night clearly has
more excitement. Estevez (who was cast very late after Tom Cruise and
Christian Slater turned down the lead role), Gooding Jnr, Piven and
Dorff play well off each other and Piven especially seems to really get
into the whiny runt of his character. Though the editors really should
have cut down the in-fighting and petty bickering between the quartet
as it often slows the film down to a complete stop.Director Stephen Hopkins (who also did Predator 2 and Blown Away) uses
creeping camera movements and neo-noir lighting to provoke multiple
eerie moments as well as a great deal of tension. Slow-mo and warped
sound effects are also used to great effect in the finale. Alan
Silvestri's score is also one of his best, alternating between several
different moods. His first score (electronic based) was rejected by
Hopkins but that difficult decision proved be a good judgment (ha!) as
the end result is one of the film's best features.Judgment Night is certainly an overlooked tour-de-force and is a
brilliant action film with fine performances all round, but Leary

385,7.5,3.5,"I was genuinely thrilled to watch ""Edgar Allan Poe's Lighthouse
Keeper"", especially since Poe was such an influential figure in the
horror literature. And the cover/poster of the movie also really looked
great and that really lured me in. And the cover/poster of the movie
actually shows promise of something of good production.The movie, however, turned out to fail miserably at living up to what I
expected from it. First of all, the movie seemed to accomplish way too
much on too small a budget. And while the movie certainly had a great
atmosphere, it was just permeated by a production value that was less
than mediocre.This wasn't a particular great transition from written format to visual
format, and the movie wasn't overly entertaining, much less captivating
or interesting. And I do believe that to be because of the slow paced
story, and the fact that very little happened throughout the course of
the entire movie. And when something actually did happen, it was just
met with questionable effects and equally questionable acting.The effects in ""Edgar Allan Poe's Lighthouse Keeper"" were definitely
tinted by being low budget, and the shambling creatures that encroached
on the people in the lighthouse were laughable to look at, especially
since the effects and make-up were not nicely made.Furthermore, the movie has a very small cast ensemble, so there was a
lot of weight on the shoulders of the cast. And it didn't really work
out great for the movie, as the acting throughout the movie was rigid,
wooden and just oozed with mediocrity.""Edgar Allan Poe's Lighthouse Keeper"" was anything but scary or
unsettling in anyway, and it didn't really capture the essence and root
of Poe's written words, which just goes to prove that there is a lot of
depth and volume to written words.If you are a fan of Edgar Allan Poe's writings, then there is very
little to find fulfilling here in director Benjamin Cooper vision of
""Edgar Allan Poe's Lighthouse Keeper"". I was tempted a couple of times
throughout the course of this movie to get up and find something else
to watch, but I stuck with it, as I wanted to see if it got better,

words of one of the most influential writers in horror history.The lighthouse here merely managed to light up 3 out of 10 stars in my

wildly off-kilter, thoughtless and mean-spirited. Filmed in Simi

mindless violence making up most of director George Armitage's script.
Armitage has gathered a most curious '70s cast for his film, including
Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and, in a
bit, Loni Anderson; however, the center of the whole thing is

movies that are deliberately slow-paced and proudly refer to themselves
as being black comedies and/or social satires, but ""I Am Not A Serial
Killer"" is clearly an exception and I really did love this film!
There's nothing too extraordinary innovative about the settings,
character drawings or even the story line(s), but the overall tone and
atmosphere of the film is so damn bleak and moody that it almost
becomes mesmerizing. From his 2005 debut feature ""Isolation"", we
already knew that Irish bloke Billy O'Brien is a talented director, but
for some strange reason it apparently took him another eleven years to
come up with his next great movie. But here it is, a solid adaptation
of Dan Wells' undoubtedly terrific novel (haven't read it yet) with
formidable performances from a stellar cast and an absorbing dark
ambiance. The story is set in a typically remote little town called
Clayton somewhere in a Northwestern State  Minnesota, I think  where
it gets damn cold, depressing and snowy during the winter months.
16-year-old John Wayne Cleaver is heavily struggling with his inner
demons. He's the type of kid who gets bullied at school because he's
introvert, peculiar and obsessed with death. His obsession might have
something to do with the fact that his mother runs a funeral home, but
John is also strongly convinced that  whether or not reluctantly  he
will someday become history's most notorious serial killer. When people
suddenly start disappearing and strange accidents occur all over town,
John naturally becomes fascinated with the idea of discovering who is
responsible for these acts and follow him/her around. He quickly
develops a connection with his friendly and elderly, but nevertheless
mysterious neighbor Mr. Crowley. The least you can say about ""I Am Not
A Serial Killer"" is that it's a non-conventional horror movie, or  to
put it in marketing terms  a horror movie that thinks out-of-the- box
and also invites the viewer to step out of his/her comfort zone. The
biggest trump of this film is undoubtedly that it doesn't rely on gory
effects or jump scares. Don't be alarmed yet, gorehouds, as there ARE
gory effects and there ARE jump scares, there just isn't any
exaggerated focus or building up towards to. Instead, ""I Am Not A
Serial Killer"" serves an intelligent screenplay full of ambiguities and
flirts with the supernatural. Countless of horror stories, whether
big-budgeted or shoestring, are set in small American towns, but very
few of them capture the atmosphere and people portrayals so accurately
as this one. That's particularly praiseworthy because director O'Brien
is Irish! The acting performances are downright fantastic, with a
seriously strong role for young Max Records as the offbeat and
narcissist teenager John Wayne Cleaver. And then there's Christopher
Lloyd I really love this actor! Lloyd makes every film that he appears
in extra macabre! Whether he appears in a drama (like ""The Onion Field""
or ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest""), in dark comedies (like ""The
Addams Family"" or ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"") or even in a kid's movie
(like ""Dennis the Menace""), Christopher Lloyd always depicts a
wondrously morbid character. His role here is one of the finest of his
career.",104,2016

clowns.This being Zombie's sixth full length feature film, it feels like much
of the same. same visual style, same vulgar dialogue, same vintage
camera filters, and the same lead actress that we are all tired of
seeing. it's a real shame that Mr. Zombie cant seem to change up his
style and make something fresh, or at least entertaining.the camera work in 31 (16) is truthfully nothing special, at times
though it is awful. it becomes nausea inducing and there are a lot of
unnecessary close ups. this paired with some of the most annoying and
disorienting editing I have ever seen makes this one a real chore to
watch. the story drags on and on at a snails pace with no tension or
suspense. this is not an exaggeration. there really is no suspense or
tension. the setting had some potential, but due to Zombie's direction
we never really get any sense of urgency or claustrophobia or anything
like that. all the characters are annoying and unlikable and the acting
is just alright, sometimes it really is terrible though. the shock
factor isn't even there on this one. Zombie is known for delivering
some truly brutal visuals but this film seems pretty tame for a Rob

391,11.75,7.5,"This new Korean film ""Train to Busan"" is certainly earning a lot of
positive word of mouth and box office success since its debut in the
Midnight Screenings section of this year's Cannes Film Festival.The central character is Seok-woo, a man stressed out with problems
about his investments business and his divorce. His 9-year old daughter
Su-an, feeling neglected, requests her father to bring her to Busan the
next day to see her estranged mother. Seok-woo could not say no.On the same train to Busan as Seok-woo and Su-an, a lady passenger with
a bite wound on her legs, collapses and turns into a zombie. As she
bites another person, that next person would also turn into a zombie
and so on. Panic ensues on the train, and as everyone eventually
discover along the way that the same zombie frenzy was true for the
rest of the country. The fight to survive is now on.This film was one exhilarating roller-coaster ride from beginning to
end. The zombies and their attack scenes were very well-executed with a
combination of practical and computer-generated effects. These monsters
were very fast-moving and relentless in their quest for human flesh. We
hear people around us gasp and shriek with shock as we see these
zombies pile up in droves and hordes, crash out of windows and barrel
through doors. We breathlessly hang on to the edge of our seats the
whole ride.Of course, what Korean film does not have a good dose of melodrama? The
father-daughter dynamic between Seok-woo and Su-an is front and center.
But aside from them, we also meet a cast of supporting characters on
the train whose fates we will be following for the rest of the film.
These include a burly man with his pregnant wife, a teenager with his
girlfriend and his baseball team, a haughty businessman, two elderly
sisters and a homeless man, among others. We get just enough
introduction about who they are for us to care about what happens to
them.Gong Woo played the flawed lead character Seok-woo very well. He was
able to convincingly portray the development of this uncaring apathetic
guy into a hero we could all root for to get through this crisis alive.
He was as good in the weepy dramatic scenes as he was in the
swashbuckling action scenes. This actor has come a long way since his
breakout role as lead star of the TV romantic comedy series ""The Coffee
Prince"" back in 2007.Kim Su-an is only 10 years old but she had already been acting in films
for five years now. She is the dramatic core of this film as the
daughter desperately reaching out to her jaded father. As a child
actress, she held her own impressively among this cast of veterans with
her heartfelt portrayal. Who would have thought that the sad little
song she wanted to sing for her father would resonate so much?Ma Dong-seok is charismatic as Sang-hwa, a devoted husband and selfless
fighter. We see him first as some sort of comic relief only, which made
the audience warm up to him. Later, we would discover how much more his
character was able to do and give for others, and loved him more. His
pregnant wife Seong-kyeong was played by acclaimed Korean indie film
actress Jung Yu-mi, conveying strength in her delicate condition. Another actor of note is Kim Eui-sung, who was totally hateful in his
role as the selfish Yong-suk. In total contrast to Sang-hwa, Yong- suk
was a man only thought of himself alone, not caring that he actually
put a lot of other characters directly into harm's way.Ahn So-hee (as Jin-hee) and Choi Woo-shik (as Young-guk) were in there
to inject some teenage romantic angst into the film. They were
relatively lightweight performers who were probably included just
because they looked cool. That scene when Young-guk encounters his
baseball teammates-turned-zombies was very well-conceived by the
writers. People may dismiss as ""just"" being a zombie film, but it is the drama
of human relationships and interactions that rises above the horrific
and thrilling carnage. Director Yeon Sang-ho's first two feature-
length films (""The King of Pigs"" and ""The Fake"") were both animated
films exploring the bleak side of human nature. With his first live
action directorial effort, Yeon has created a complete film masterpiece
with ""Train to Busan."" Highly recommended! 10/10.",118,2016

393,11.333333333333334,6.1,"Watching early films by classic directors in the midst of discovering
their trademark style always proves to be an interesting endeavor, and
Martin Scorsese's Boxcar Bertha is no exception. Made the year before
Scorsese's breakthrough hit, and first tale of Italian American life on
the streets, Mean Streets, Boxcar Bertha shows the legendary Scorsese
adapting his own personal narrative style into a different niche, and
attempting what he referred to as a ""genre picture"". Boxcar Bertha was
first pitched as a simple exploitation film, but under the capable
guiding hand of Scorsese, the final outcome is a highly enjoyable and
surprisingly in depth portrait of the lifestyle and viewpoints of
depression era railroad workers. Even in this early work, Scorsese shows his almost unparalleled ability
to create a shockingly vivid and humane portrait of the working class;
while the film may not be set in little Italy, the same themes ring
true and the characters' voices are once again perfectly captured,
speaking out against repression from the upper classes and the harsh
conditions of their everyday lives. Scorsese also demonstrates a knack
for creating a particularly believable period look and feel; indeed,
the film's set design is particularly impressive, and the audience
seems to live and breathe the harsh fumes of the boxcar at the height
of 1920s depression. It's also interesting to watch the gestation of several of Scorsese's
definitive film-making techniques, even in an earlier effort - his use
of high speed camera zooms, bold, dramatic editing and an aggressive,
wonderfully bluesy musical score may seem slightly out of place for a
film such as this, but these are all vintage Scorsese moments, which,
when identified as such, just make the film all the more enjoyable.
There are also some moments of not so subtle religious allusions, most
memorably a gruesome and hard to watch scene involving Big Bill Shelley
near the film's conclusion, another Scorsese trademark. However, forced
to adapt his vision to the conventions of the style of film he was
instructed to make, Scorsese was forced to include several highly
unnecessary nude scenes and gunfights with absurdly fake blood, which
can prove entertaining on a campy level, though they detract from the
more interesting aspects of the film, on the whole. It's just a shame
that the subject matter the budding director was given to work with was
so intentionally sparse and simplistic, but the surprising depth and
complexity he extracted from what at first appeared to be a simple
Bonnie and Clyde knockoff billed as a ""true story"" only served as a
precursor for the brilliant career which was to follow. Considering the film's original intent, it is surprising to see such a
varied array of talented performances on display. Whether it is a
testament to Scorsese's nearly unparalleled skill as an actor's
director or the enthusiasm and dedication of the cast remains to be
seen, but either way, the principle players contribute surprisingly
strong performances to the film. As the film's title character, Barbara
Hershey establishes a solid foundation to the film's acting front,
turning a character who could easily be dismissed as repulsive into one
who comes across as endearing and hard not to like due to Hershey's
laid back charm. Character actor David Carradine of recent Kill Bill
fame also gives a resonant and charismatic performance as 'Big Bill'
Shelly, the robin hood figure of the railroads. Bernie Casey overcomes
his disappointingly underwritten role with a charming and very likable
performance as a fellow robber, and Barry Primus is also enjoyable to
watch as yet another accomplice, and the only New Yorker in the film.
(there had to be at least one) It's also great to see father and son
spar off as John Carradine plays the head of a railroad who is thrown
into a battle of wits with the thief and saboteur played by his real
life son, and the two quiver with surprising tension and energy during
their on screen encounter. While it is highly unlikely Boxcar Bertha will come across as appealing
to a widespread modern audience, there is still much to appreciate
here, and the film should be considered essential viewing for Scorsese
enthusiasts. Despite the film's premise as a simple exploitation film,
Scorsese found the voice and soul of the time and characters, which
resonate almost as fully as in any of his better known pictures.
Despite the film's occasionally choppy plot structure and admittably
simple subject matter, Boxcar Bertha is still a highly enjoyable and
interesting early Scorsese effort which merits seeing for any fans of
the director, stars, or anyone interested in the historical context.
Don't pass this off just due to the Corman exploitation influence -
there's much more to it than that!-7/10",88,1972

hip, and edgy. Quick cuts, split scenes, savagery, foulness and drugs
have been the go-to formula for Guy Ritchie flavoured flicks.
Superfluous savagery, pointless bareness, and simply through and
through preposterousness. Again Cage in his cliché suit and tie,
passing out wisecracks, being the sharp edgy person (imply: exhausting)
combined with a couple of half bare inked chicks and a lot of harsh
looking ex-cons. The discourse isn't enthralling, the story line isn't
fascinating, and the film all in all is forgettable. There was no
story, no rushes however shabby firearm shooting activity. Overall, the
film's plot is not so much the title phrase ""dog eat dog"" as
predictable keystone criminals, who are ultimately second- rate thugs
racing their way to the grave. The whole thing feels like some jaded
movie executive's crowd sourced project. There was no story, no thrills

and sadness come to the surface even when she's silent. I've always
liked Shia LaBeouf but I've usually felt like the films he's done don't
interest me so I don't get to see his performances that much.I realize that the film is long, but I think it's part of what makes
this film special. It takes time to develop and meanders a bit in the
process but again it's part of what makes the film seem so genuine.
Though the premise of the story is a bit ridiculous in itself it's
really just a vehicle to let us in on the behavior of these young
people. What makes them tick. What kind of music they like. How they
relate to each other.Clearly this film isn't for everyone. You should have an idea what it
is about before you partake in the investment of watching it. But if
you are like me and enjoy the sociological aspect of feeling like you
are eavesdropping on the life of these young people then it's a great

399,13.0,1.7,"Oh boy, where to start with this one. Well after our review of the
first Krampus by Jason Hull, we promised that we would review the
upcoming sequel. We wish we hadn't but there you have it, at least you
can skip this abysmal rubbish and save precious ours of your life doing
something more interesting, like drilling your eyeballs out or maybe
pulling your toenails off.Five years after the tragic events of the first film (Krampus: The
Christmas Devil - See review), our hero Jeremy Duffin (A.J. Leslie,
complete with terrible fake beard) is brought back to the force by his
old captain Farabee (Goteri). It would seem that Santa and Krampus are
up to their old tricks and kidnapping naughty children again (no
half-naked nubile girls for Krampus this year though, perhaps he was
naughty too).We then see Santa actually playing as a store Santa at a local store
where one particular naughty child pulls his beard and is generally a
little brat. Needless to say Santa makes sure to get his name. Poor old
Jezza who just didn't realise his daughter was a very naughty girl and
deserved to be spanked, is still haunted by the events (as are we).
After a ridiculous stern face moment in a mirror, Jezza jumps back into
action in a Bruce Willis from the eighties moment and becomes his old
self.We get to see Santa (again played by Ferm who was at least half amusing
in the first film), dancing to Christmas jingles before offing the
little ones. Their hideout is now an actual house - of the seventies
hillbilly variety (no idea what happened to the cave). Krampus is his
usual calm and shuffling self, even though for some strange reason, he
now looks completely different (and worse). He actually looked pretty
good in the first film, but here he looks like a reject from a sixties
monster fancy-dress party. They couldn't even be bothered to do his
hands this time around, instead choosing to have him in black gloves.Quite frankly I'm struggling to see where the million dollars (the
apparent budget) went. If you're not aware of my thoughts on very
low-budget Indie films, then head off to watch Into the Woods (Sam
Raimi) or El Mariachi for what can be done with no money. Anyway, the
acting and the script are laughable and unbelievably are actually worse
than in the first film. The camera work and photography have to be some
of the worst I have ever seen and the audio is completely all over the
damn place. No idea what they did or were doing, but to Hull and
Leslie, fire your sound guy.I've said before, I'm all for people pursuing their dreams and I'd love
to have a crack at making a film myself one day, but seriously guys,
just recognise that you have no talent, no good ideas and just give it
up. For everyone's sake. For all those people who constantly witter on
about 'the worse film I have ever seen', I suggest watching more films,
and then watching this gem of a joke. This is a real contender folks.

character in 2 seasons and the specials. My personal favourite was
Extras, a spot on, brilliantly funny and original follow up to The

boring rehash of using celebrities parodying themselves again, Derek
was largely rubbish, and now this. I sat straight faced throughout the whole thing which made me very sad
as I genuinely love Ricky Gervais, but this is pretty awful, maybe as
bad as Special Correspondents. Brent is no longer the character he was
in The Office, he is a level of sad sack that is too unbelievable to be
true, he is too unaware to be true and so it's just not funny at all. Brent in The Office was believable, he also showed a humanity that made
the writing so much better (Merchant and Gervais may work better as a
team, although Life's too short is an example where it does't work.) he
was someone who had flaws that were observational in the sense that
anyone who has worked in an Office may have seen an amalgam of those
characteristics in people they worked with. In this movie that has
gone, in its place, poor cringe inducing moments that were not in the

for years that has in turn led to rivalry and jealously are not exactly
new ground but in 'The Hollars' it never feels overly familiar thanks
largely to the golden rule of film making, that a good script is King.
The movie directing debut of John Krasinski, who also acts see's him
play John Hollar, a struggling insecure graphic novelist, with a
pregnant girlfriend (Anna Kendrick) living in New York. Upstate his
father (Jenkins, brilliant as always) is running a failing family
business, while his brother (Sharlto Copley) Ron, has just been fired
by the Dad for warning him they're days away from bankruptcy. Ron has
his own problems, going through a divorce from his wife and missing his
two daughters, resulting in some what dysfunctional behaviour. It is in
this setting that the patriarchal mother of the household (Margo
Martindale, so natural & so brilliant she makes acting looks
effortless) discovers she has a brain tumour, forcing the brothers
together and the father to re- evaluate himself and the mistakes he may
have made before its too late. A subplot involves John meeting his old
flame who has now married high school friend turned hospital nurse
(Charlie Day) who in turn is a bit of a dick. Will John resolve his own
issues and see what is right in front of him, how will the father cope
with his impending loss and can Ron find a peaceful solution to his
messy divorce & cope with his wife's new love in the form of the
affable local Priest (Nicely underplayed by Josh Groban) - Such are the
dilemmas facing this familiar feeling family. How dramas of this type work often depend on how engaging the
characters are and connecting with them at an early stage. Krasinski
cleverly never makes you like anyone in-particular too much or too
little, tugging at the heart strings just right. Krasinski assembled a
top notch group of actors here who clearly know their craft. This could
have been a play on stage, but has enough drama to work well on screen.
Copley plays a role very different from previous performances and
handles the American accent with ease, while Kendrick proves she can
handle a more demanding role outside of the Twilight Saga spectrum.
Some characters feel a little underwritten, Ashley Dyke does well to
make you notice her in a part with little characterisation, but
essentially this is a film about The Hollars (Hence the title) and they
are rightly the focus of the piece. I have no doubt that Margo Martindale will be criminally under looked
when it comes to award season for her role of the mother. One of those
actresses who I have seen hundreds of times, has assured I will always
know her name after this performance. The film may not break much new
ground, but it is certainly among the best within its genre and
fortunately, it wasn't set during Thanksgiving with a scene involving a
turkey. Recommended.",88,2016

that when he looked in on the filming of a comedy, he knew everything
was all right if the cast and crew were joking and laughing and having
a good time. In his experience, that energy would translate to the
screen and the picture would be funny and enjoyable.Although Corman did not produce this particular picture, ""Beware! The
Blob"" looks to me to be exemplary of this kind of thinking. The cast
was obviously enjoying the experience of making the film, and we, the
audience, get the benefit. A certain sense of giddy frivolity is
evident.This movie was made by Jack Harris and Larry Hagman in the 70's--the
early 70's. And by golly, it shows. Many people hate this film, and
part of me wants to shout, ""C'mon, guys, this is great stuff! You're
watching it the wrong way!"" But really, this film isn't for everyone.
Not everyone likes grape jelly. Or strawberry jam. And that's...okay.I would say this sequel to the (excellent) ""The Blob"" is played
half-seriously, and that's why I find it so strange and refreshing.
Sometimes it's a raucous farce. Sometimes it's straight horror. And
oddly enough for a 70's film, it seems to know when it is being one or
the other, and keeps true to whatever it is at that moment. It's not
nearly as badly made as many of its detractors claim.Watch it for the pea soup-thick 70's atmosphere. You'll feel as if
you've entered another world. Watch it for the inventive low-budget
special effects. A few shots look pretty nice even today. Watch it for
the scene with the bald would-be victim guy in the bathtub, who throws
the phone through the window when he sees the gelatinous menace oozing
under his bathroom door, and who is then seen running starkers through
the streets, shouting, while funny music plays. ""Beware! The Blob"" is
extremely goofy, exciting, brightly-colored fun stuff. It is extremely
representative of the era in which it was made.Trust me: There is NO movie that entertains the way this one does. See

as double-features on their home turf, Hammer returned to premium
quality horror with FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED, arguably the
company's finest hour, and certainly Peter Cushing's definitive
portrayal of the monstrous Baron. Here, he blackmails medical student
Simon Ward (making his feature debut) and his lovely fiancée Veronica
Carlson into helping him with a brain transplant which - naturally -
goes horribly wrong. Instead of the misguided adventurer depicted in
previous films, screenwriter Bert Batt emphasizes the Baron's ruthless
pursuit of knowledge and power, culminating in an unexpected sequence
in which Cushing's domination of Carlson segues from mere tyranny to
rape, a scene which Cushing reportedly found distasteful. Overall,
however, Batt's script allows the characters to evolve via a skilfully
constructed plot which employs levels of drama and emotion largely
absent from much of Hammer's output at the time, alongside the usual
elements of horror and suspense.Director Terence Fisher rises to the occasion with remarkable
dexterity, orchestrating set-pieces which have been compared to
Hitchcock in some quarters, especially the opening sequence in which a
petty thief (Harold Goodwin) breaks into the wrong house and has a
truly hair-raising confrontation with its volatile owner (leading to a
memorable 'reveal'); and the traumatic moment in the back garden of
Carlson's boarding house, when she's forced to deal with a corpse (one
of Frankenstein's cast-offs) ejected from its makeshift grave by a
burst water pipe. Freddie Jones adds pathos to the proceedings as the
helpless victim of Frankenstein's latest experiment, his brain
transplanted into another man's body against his will, traumatizing his
incredulous wife (Maxine Audley) who refuses to accept his new identity
(a scenario echoed by a similar plot line in John Woo's FACE/OFF in
1997). The period décor may look a little cramped and cut-price in
places, but this is Hammer/Fisher/Cushing at the very height of their

directing an emotionally heartfelt story. Sully continues Eastwood's
success by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.""The miracle on the Hudson"" is the subject of this Eastwood drama,
starring Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, and Laura Linney. There will be
plenty of obstacles with any film based on a true story, but with a
film based on an event that lasted a mere 208 seconds, it's extra
difficult. But Eastwood manages to pull a great story out of these
unbelievable events that comes in just under 2 hours. Of course, the
flight itself isn't the only hurdle that captain Sully went through, as
he dealt with reporters, investigators, and the National Transportation
Safety Board determined to diminish his heroic efforts.Who could possibly be better to play Captain Sully than the great Tom
Hanks. Having wonderfully played another ""controversial"" captain back
in 2013 as Captain Phillips, there was no doubt he could pull off a
somewhat similar role. Boy does Hanks deliver. He always effortlessly
pulls out the big speeches and powerful dialogue well, but I often find
his more subtle acting to be more impressive. It's the moments when
Sully is reacting to the big moments with only his facial expressions
and body languages that give me goosebumps. Not many actors are able to
bring me to the verge of tears just by a facial expression, but Hanks
is one of them.Eastwood and his editors also deserve tons of credit for their work
here. Much like Hanks' subtle acting, I love when Eastwood holds back
the bombastic music (that can sometimes take you out of a story like
this) and lets the audience choose how to feel by watching gorgeous
cinematography and poignant acting and directing. This may be
Eastwood's best directorial work since Million Dollar Baby. He
understood exactly the moments to use and not music in order to pull
the emotion out of his audience.Most of all, this film is a great display of the power of the human
spirit. Everything about this film is grounded with humanity. No one
seems fake. So often Hollywood is flooded with over-the-top filmmaking

enjoy the simple pleasures of pure entertainment.And that's what STORKS delivers better than babies or packages:
entertainment.You might have noticed people commenting on how forced and thin the
storyline is and how uneven it feels, and those complaints are
accurate. The plot is extremely thin (virtually an extended
sitcom-sized premise stretched into an epic road-trip format), and the
story moves so quickly that it goes too far too fast with nary any
breathing room to savor the experience or give the characters the
tension or time to build any real catharsis or change. But the
characters are so authentic to themselves that you know just about
everything you need to know about them from their first scenes.I think the main reason STORKS gets such middling reviews in print and
here on IMDb is because it's an old-fashioned type of comedy: a
screwball-slapstick hybrid. The emphasis on sight gags, pain-humor, and
wackiness has generally been avoided in animated films as passe and
vulgar--low comedy. The rapid-fire snark between the main characters of
Tulip and Junior hearken back to the old Howard Hawks workplace
comedies of the 1930s, which is definitely an acquired taste in the
post-narrative style of humor found in kids entertainment today--where
non-sequiturs and punchlines exist in a vacuum and visual comedy is
derived from abstraction rather than plasticity. But the comedic energy
and the variety of jokes from modern ""Office""-style cringe (Pigeon
Toady) to the machine-gun-speed HIS GIRL FRIDAYy-style verbal sparring
(Tulip & Junior), absurdism (the wolves), post-modern meta-humor (the
boy and his parents) to classical WB slapstick of yesteryear, and the
film is riotously funny because of it. At the end of the day, that's
what STORKS wants to be: FUNNY.STORKS is not a great film. It's not a masterpiece like TOY STORY or
UP. It won't win any Oscars and it won't be everyone's cup of tea. But
there's an excellent chance that it will live on as a
multi-generational favorite for the same reasons as
dumb-fun-with-a-heart-of-gold treasures like SPACEBALLS, DUMB & DUMBER,
THE NAKED GUN, and NATIONAL LAMPOONS CHRISTMASs VACATION:Because you can watch it 1,000 times and it will NEVER stop being
funny.So try it out. There's a 50-50 chance you'll be among the ones who
can't stop watching it.",87,2016
412,1.0,5.5,"So Scott Atkins pretty much always means extraordinary action scenes.
Here however, the first five minutes feel more like a gritty drama.
Especially the first two minutes with Scott doing his exercises and
looking with intense sadness at something made me think this could be
something different than the usual stuff he is doing - well nope.The plot is all over the place. Scott and his movie daughter are
apparently in witness protection and some dudes invade his home out of
pure stupidity and coincidence. So Scott has to let out his superhero
alter ego and brutally murder everyone. Except his daughter of course.
Well, since he is all over the news now, he is kind of hunted by the
crime boss he was hiding from in witness protection. Cinematography is actually quite nice. Good camera movement for the
nearly exploitative action scenes. Also good editing - you always have
an overview what happens, and if you don't, it is intended and enhances
suspense a little. The flick uses toned down colors to convey the
gritty and realistic feel. In total, I would say the movie is
competently shot on a technical level.The actors...well there is Scott Atkins, who is not known for his
acting ability, but for his amazing martial arts. But I think he became
quite convincing in the last years. The thing is, he never really has a
role that needs his acting chops. It's not different here. Apart from
him, there is maybe the main bad guy that is somehow memorable. He does
have the physical presence needed, he seems intimidating when he is
walking along with his firearms. Acting wise, there is not much
happening though.So in essence, the film could have been better with a more interesting
script and maybe more interesting dialogue. Some people die and you
should be feeling something, but you don't. That is the fault of the
script. It is very bare minimum story as set up for really really good
action scenes. So really, good movie for Scott Atkins fans and martial
arts enthusiasts. The rest of potential audiences won't get much out of
the movie though.Five out of ten for general movie competence and action scenes.",94,2016

enough for me. I wonder what a multiple part sequel series would look like. Same
writer, but different directors. Maybe to actually follow Michelle and

416,15.4,5.8,"The advertisements MORGAN ended with the question ""What is Morgan""?After seeing this film, my answer is ""I don't care""!MORGAN is the story of what happens when man tries to create artificial
life. Much like the superior EX MACHINA, it grapples with issues of
whether Morgan is a person, or a thing and should man do this.
Unfortunately, it grapples with these issues much like I grapple with
getting the top off a jar of pickles - clumsily.Director Luke Scott (son of Ridley) assembles a strong cast that is,
quite frankly, wasted. Kate Mara stars as ""Corporate Risk Management
Consultant"" Lee Weathers who has come to assess the Morgan ""project"" at
a remote research facility (are there any other kind?) - is mysterious
and quiet, too much so in fact. I was immediately aware of the
telegraphing of ""something's up with her"" from the get go. Mara (and/or
the director) could have benefited from being more subtle with her
character.The usually reliable Toby Jones plays one note as the lead Scientist on
the project and the great Michelle Yeoh continues her screen comeback
in mediocre films (see my review of MECHANIC RESURRECTION) as another
scientist who is there to, I think, mumble the line ""We're not going to
repeat the mistakes of Helsinki"" over and over again. Only Rose
Leslie's behavioral psychologist gets to play some range, but her
character, who is supposed to be an expert in her field, does some
really dumb things.Add to that 2 actors who, I am assuming, got paid VERY WELL for being
in this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh follows up her Oscar- nominated turn
in THE HATEFUL EIGHT with this role that she - quite literally - sleeps
through for most of the film. Perhaps, she had a juicy scene left on
the cutting room floor or perhaps she owed Luke's dad a favor, but this
was a NOTHING role that, quite frankly, she brought nothing to.And then there is our old pal, Paul Giamatti. Mr. Giamatti can be a
very fine, nuanced actor. He can also chew the scenery with the best of
them - and chew scenery he does. He is in only one scene in this film
(though the previews make him look like a major player) and I think
director Scott kept saying to him ""Bigger...BIGGER!"" and bigger he
went. To be honest, I was getting a little bored of this movie before
Giamatti showed up, so, at least, he pumped some life and energy in
this film.Finally, there is the performance of Anya Taylor-Joy as Morgan.
Taylor-Joy is being hailed as an ""up and coming"" actress for her
performances in last springs THE VVITCH and this film. I saw them both
and if your definition of ""up and coming actress"" is playing blank
stares and not saying much, then she's your gal. I gotta see more from
her before I declare her ""the next big thing"".Truly disappointed in this one. If you want to see a film grappling
with the issues of man creating Artificial Life, then see EX MACHINA,
if you want to see a brand new filmmaker taking a swing and a miss and
wasting some good talent, see MORGAN.5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",92,2016

books, but I have seen the original film many times. I re-watched it
not long ago, and had to admit it had worn out for me, but that's
probably my own fault. It's not meant to be seen every holiday season.
Still, it has very good timing and it's bittersweet. Bridget Jones'
Baby doesn't and isn't. It's dragging and it would make absolutely no
sense to anyone not familiar with the first ones. The millennial
characters are unfunny and implausible, the writing there is both
patronizing and eager to please, like me following my friend's teenage
son on Instagram and commenting YOLO. Pussy Riot and cats that look
like Hitler... and the next minute jokes about human rights
violations... So, I actually watched for the experience of a 40+
pregnant woman, of any glimpses of successfully acted emotions. And for
Colin Firth, and possibly Emma Thompson, although I think I'd now like
to forget she has screenplay credit in this. But still, what happened?
Was everyone an amateur? It was like the characters from earlier films
were all doing cameos. Renee Zellweger was playing herself playing her
character 12 years later. No, she was standing in for herself in that
role. Her voice was often barely audible, like she was really, really
tired.",118,2016

Street or The Big Short, but with a twist, as the woman is playing the

situation unique, but it is.The movie does really focus on the main character too. Well, actually
there is a big ensemble cast, which all have their very unique story
that really drives the story,But it does focus a lot on the development of those characters, and the
story suffers for this. I just found the movie too slow in it's
delivery of the story. I feel like I spent too much time waiting for
the story to happen in-between getting to know the characters.It would not be that big of an issue but I don't feel the big pay off
of the film. All the character development and I felt nothing for what
happens to these people after the dust cleared.Equity was about business, but it was too much business. Too stiff, Too
clean of a strike. Did not hit me like it should, which kinda sucks as
it's one of those movies about cooperation that's pretty easy to
follow, which is great.So yeah, a uniquely told story got me hooked but it's too bland for me

they come from. Must be friends and family of the directors.It already started weird but was sort of interesting. Anything could
have happen and because I had no idea about this film, I kept watching.Then something happened but it didn't really fit in with the start. It
seemed that I was watching a subtle horror, when suddenly a ridiculous
story line emerged. It was so unfitting that I assumed it was
purposefully bad in order to highlight a mental illness or something.But it never happened. The cartoon story was actually what the film was
about. Stuff about Egypt and Pharaos and Princesses and a love story
and a realm of hell and an amulet. I remember writing stories like that
when I was 10. It was cringe worthy and tacky.Up to the very end I gave the bad acting my benefit of the doubt,
waiting to find out that the main character was actually in a mental

there is no explanations for events so it is difficult for a child to
understand.It is a about a dog family. Father goes to space but mother and

suddenly knew that the children's father is in space and tell the small
dog to go to space. But there is no scene in the movie to show that how
the cat knew about the incident. And there is no details about the film. Characters are coming and going
without any notice. Lots of character which were frequent suddenly

sending animals to the moon. Sometimes it was shown that animals are

movie for so long, I loved Suicide Squad in Assault on Arkham and I was
so happy when the news arrived about the live action movie. And as a
massive Jared Leto fan I was extremely happy they chose him for the
role of my all time favorite character, Joker. So I was hyped to see
him, but the whole gang too. And what I got from the movie was equal
with pure sadness. I mean, Jared was in it for a total 10 minutes and
his role could have been easily left out, I only knew the characters
because I read the comics and watched the wonderful animation (which by
the way a 100 times better), the story telling was HORRIBLE, the actors
could have been wonderful but they kinda lost in the terrible script.
Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis were fantastic but we didn't
really get to know them... and the other characters were only there
for... who know why? WHY DC, WHY? This story had so much promise and
you ruined it... You should have adopted the Assault on Arkham into a
live action movie... All these characters would needed a stand alone
movie, and once we've got to know them then put them together... sure
it would take years to build up a universe like that, but come on,

street life. I could not imagine, can you? Where do you go? What do you

This film, I think, provides a great glimpse into the life of a

pleasantly surprised. I was expecting another modern indie Western shot
in some Wild West theme park with stunt men pretending to be actors and
a half-baked script.Outlaws and Angels blew me away. The psychosexual dynamics of the
screenplay stretch the Western genre until it bursts apart at the
seams. This is not a family film. It's not Shane, although it is
something of a morality play, with several characters getting their
just due at the end of a gun. There is plenty of violence and sexual
content. Although the seedier bits are handled with care, prudes and
squeamish viewers are advised to skip this one.The direction and editing are crisp and tight and the production values
are excellent. Locations and costumes are authentic - there are no
actresses with bleached hair and Maybelline blush and no cheap
polyester duds on the dudes. The soundtrack is the most inventive in
the genre since Ennio Morricone's signature work on spaghetti Westerns.The cast is superb and matched perfectly with their characters. All the
actors are totally believable and appealing, but Francesca Eastwood
steals the show with her quirky beauty and nuanced performance.If you like intense action thrillers like Sicario, check this one out.

disappoint. No it's not particularly original, nor is it the best
comedy Saunders herself has written, but this film is so feel good you
can't help but grin, giggle and laugh-out-loud throughout. The film is brisk and whips by very quickly. Though the story is often
disjointed, it's not where the film goes it's what happens while you're
there. Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Saunders are just a joy to watch and
there's a ton of fan service as practically everyone who has ever been
in the show makes an appearance here. I came out of the cinema grinning ear to ear, which oddly not all
comedies manage to do. It was like going for meal with an old friend

them is that everything can't possible be as it seems, because
otherwise there would be no point in making the movie. There's nothing
at all interesting about a straightforward court case, however one with
a twist is a thing to behold. The only problem with this is that a lot
of them end up getting rated purely on the strength of their twist.
Everything that has happened up until that point can tend to be
forgotten. That's sort of the case again here. A solid, but not
stunning movie comes alive with a very strong ending, and it certainly
adds some plus points to the final opinion of the film.I tend to really like Keanu Reeves thrillers. A lot of his dramas and
sci-fi films are completely forgettable, but when he signs on to a
thriller it often seems to turn out very good. Renee Zellweger on the
other hand is far from a personal favourite of mine. She has a serious
lack of charisma and her appearance change is very distracting in this
film. I feel like there are a lot of actresses who could have done a
better job in this role.'The Whole Truth' is a film that is entertaining throughout, partly
because you are almost certain there is a twist coming, and partly
because the story is well written and movies at a good pace. Then at

ago than a professional astro turf review (apologise for bad English as
it is not my 1st language):This movie proves why IMDb ratings are a joke for any genre outside of
Drama and non-slapstick Comedy movies. Amazed the budget was so low for
this project.My expectations were lowered thinking it to be an average gore flick.
The movie draws you in and you care for the characters.. hardly any
overacting, females are shown to be neither completely weak damsels nor
Mary Sue Goddesses .. they got the balance right and reactions were
very realistic. Pretty cool concept well executed and not butchered by
the ending as happens so often. Although very subtle we find out
towards the end that there are more layers to what meets the eye. Hope
they make a sequel as they left room for it.My only complain is that they could've upped the violence a BIT (not
too much like Eli Roth) as it is more of a thriller. The duration is
perfect - no point watching a 100-120 minute movie, too much downside
with that route.Finally - even though I am not a Yank or even political - thank you for
not taking any ethnic swipes towards Southerners in general as happens
so often in Hollywood.Big Thank you to Director, actors and everyone who was involved with

432,9.75,5.4,"If you want to talk about a movie that's a black hole for careers,
let's talk about Best of the Best 2. Director Robert Radler wound up
working on Power Rangers episodes, Eric Roberts usually appears in
magazines making jealous comments about his much more successful
sister, and Philip Rhee...well, the less said about Best of the Best 3
and 4, the better. Ralf Moeller, the chief bad guy, usually winds up
playing the big sidekick, most visibly in Gladiator. Ironically, he's
probably made out better than anyone else involved, save for the
invincible Wayne Newton.Judged by the standards of its genre, the movie isn't entirely
terrible. Judging action movies on the same scale as more respectable
fare is like expecting your 59 cent hamburger to taste like steak, and
Best of the Best 2 is better than a lot of comparable movies I've seen.
The fight scenes are refreshingly high-impact and plentiful, Newton is
as deliciously slimy as Richard Dawson in The Running Man, and Moeller
makes for a formidable bad guy in the ring. In these respects and
others, this movie compares well with better-known movies like
Bloodsport or the terrible Kickboxer.The bad parts are definitely bad, however. The script, as is usual for
the genre, consists of the standard tough-guy posturing, but is not
even particularly clever at that. Roberts looks like he's being
directed to think about his paycheck whenever he's supposed to act
happy. Rhee (the real star) does a good job in the ring, but his
transformation from calm martial artist to brutal vengeance artist is
not really played at all. The bad guys, other than Moeller and to some
extent Newton, are completely devoid of menace. The worst part of all -
and one of the most cringe-inducing scenes I've ever witnessed - is the
first scene with James, where a pathetic drunk's tragic fall is played
for laughs. This scene will and should offend almost anyone who
understands it.On the ugly side, the movie's production design definitely reflects its
budget. Best of the Best 2 looks and sounds at least 10 years older
than it actually is. In style, form, and substance, it's well behind
the curve. Some of the violence is really painful to watch, namely two
close-ups of Rhee breaking limbs in hapkido arm locks. This is a cheap
shot, but Roberts' girlfriend looks like she's about 70. All told, it
is not a study in economy. Shot for about the same budget as a Star
Trek: The Next Generation 2-part episode, this movie looks way worse.Is it completely terrible? Well, don't be looking for The Godfather. If
some cheesy fighting is your bag, however, you're looking at the right
movie. Recommended for genre diehards and 12-year-olds, but not really
for anyone else.",101,1993

minimal cast film and takes place in a single isolated location and its
surroundings. So what I meant is this is a small gem. If you ever
thought of trying B movie, but hesitated for many reasons, so this is
the one to pick, especially if you like thrillers.The story narration has the time loop influence. It opened in a drug
rehab centre where a youngster named Milton was approached by a
beautiful girl Skyler to cook crystal meth for her. So the same night
they two breakout with the help of her boyfriend Russell to the woods
where they do what they have come for. But the next morning, Milton
sees a big change, particularly by Skyler. He never realises that until
another next day. For us, the viewers, this is the part to focus as the
turning point in the narration.So the day keeps repeating itself as a 24 hour loop from where it all
started, but with a different events every day, like giving another
chance not knowing why. So they try to figure it out and in a
meanwhile, they fall for each other. When one day they think they got a
way out, that brings a new trouble as the solution needs a sacrifice or
betrayal. Who choose what or is there any other way that told in the
remaining film.""Not a single enemy left. Not a single friend either.""This theme really needed to be very smart, because most of the viewers
to question the flaws. So in a couple of times I said there it goes
one, how could they did miss it. But then they proved me wrong in a few
minutes later. The writing was so good. He and the director were
usually worked on the children's films, but they surprised us with this
little gem. Honestly, they deserve to work on the bigger projects with
full freedom to execute their creativity. So I am definitely expecting
their next feature film would come soon or maybe a follow-up to this.My advice is for you not to underestimate it after seeing its trailer
or the poster, or even reading some bad remarks. Like I said, its not a
big production's fancy film, but with its limit, it did try its best to
give up-to our expectation. So don't mind the actors, actually they
were so cool. I thought the lead girl was Daniella Monet, then later
realised she's different. She is the girl who fled the village to Rohan
after Orcs attached them in the film LOTR. Now she's all grown up and
did great in this.This could be easily called an sci-fi-thriller, but according to the
story and the direction of its development, surely it belongs to
fantasy-thriller. Whatever, don't go for it thinking it is a horror
film, if you are a fan of that genre. Because it merely fits with that.
Anyway, it is a very entertaining film, the suspense holds for us a
very long with the fine pace of the story narration. It is one of the
best among the B movies I had seen so far and overall from the time
loop themes. I do recommend it, but for the selected people.7.5/10",104,2014
436,3.0,5.4,"The movie's premise is something with some potential. The characters
are good in that they are similar in some ways and polar opposites in
others. The dialog is good and it is well acted. However, it never
captures the viewer. It always seems like the movie is going to pick up
and then it never does. There were so many opportunities for great
comedy that were just completely missed. The bike stealing scene for
example could have been turned into something rather than simply having
the characters stare blindly as their bicycle is stolen. It felt like
the movie went on forever and the premise got thinner with each passing
minute. I wish I could recommend this film because I love independents
but it just simply never got going and the director, where as it was
very well shot, really let some good opportunities slip away.",98,2014

had to face leaving room for clarity and forgiveness on both their
parts and hilarity and fun for the audience. I loved every scene and
thought every character had great chemistry with one another making
everything rocking. Both sisters demonstrated a relatable character
with distinct personalities and flaws. The beauty of the film is how
they unravel one another by unraveling themselves first. I think the
message really stood out to worry first about yourself before you worry
too much about anyone else, even those you love, because like Martha,
you may feel like what you're giving isn't enough and that the other
person is ungrateful for your efforts, when really what you're trying
to fulfill is a void inside of you. I laughed a lot during this movie

is beautiful composed and Johnnie really looses himself in the music.
Johnnie plays the violin with a passion that is breathtaking. Ruby's
dance is wonderful and she has that innocent Femme Fatale down pat. The
dance off in the subway between two rivaling dance teams was
unexpected, but I found them to be better dancers than the main dance
team living below Johnnie. The final dance sequence is emotionally

it will get seen most in middle school classrooms doing a study on the
book, which it follows very closely. It's not without some rough edges-
-there is some language and behavior that may not be to every parent's
liking, but I appreciated that it made an effort to show how a real
person might react in her situation. I will say the book told this
story more effectively--several scenes had more impact as written, and
I felt a much greater sense of urgency in the final scene of the book
than I did watching the film. Even so, I think that it's a story that
will hook viewers in and keep them invested right to the end. Without
being manipulative or delving into false sentiment, The Great Gilly

However, this movie just reeks of bad acting, terrible dialog and weak
story telling.Robert Redford was unbelievably bad. His acting came across as
insincere and his dialog was stiff. Dallas Bryce Howard was much better
in this movie than Redford. However, the way she engaged the young boy
(Pete) was more like a textbook than what I would expect someone to do.This movie ultimately fails because the acting isn't genuine and the
dialog is just plain terrible. It achieves feel good, but, it insults
the intelligence of the audience. The Jungle Book was much better
dialog. Don't talk down to kids. They are not stupid.I hope Disney take more risks like this. However, they need to tighten
up the dialog and acting a lot.Ultimately, this movie is more like a C grade TV show. They need less

445,4.666666666666667,6.6,"From the directors of 'A Cat in Paris', but this film set in New York
City that narrates the story of a boy with an extraordinary power. If
you had liked that film, you probably would like it as well, but a
little lesser. Except this is not about the art of theft, but a cop
trying to catch a most dangerous criminal. It is so weird to see the
New York turned into kind of a province of France as everybody in this
speak French, but expected it as it's a French film.A very interesting storyline. The characters were well designed and
developed. But most of the film was focused on the boy, the cop and the
main villain with a dog's perspective. There's a little part of a
reporter as well. So I think it should have been called 'A Dog in New
York', but the dog is on the wrong side where the most of the story was
narrated from. The theme was not fresh, but the way they used to tell
the tale makes all the difference. I mean you can compare it to 'If I
Stay' kind of plenty of other films. Except it turned into a
crime-thriller.A young boy named Leo, who is hospitalised for the serious illness, has
a special power to leave his body and take an invisible form, and come
back again safely within some time frame. On the other side an honest
cop trying to hunt down a criminal who is threatening the peace of the
city gets a backlash after met with an accident. Now the cop and the
boy join the hands to thwart the villain's latest attempt to bring
disruption. The mission was not planned well, so how they fight the
crime and its result brings to an end to the film.""I'm not hungry. It's a shame because my dad's pasta is the best in the
world.""This is a PG film, that means it's aimed for all the ages. But
particularly for the grown ups, there's nothing much to enjoy other
than cool presentation. That does not mean for all the grown ups. The
sketches and the animation technics were same as the previous film.
They tried to reach bigger audience worldwide from the success of their
previous film, but seems not achieved that goal. As the film had many
great features like the characters and the story, they have fallen
short to surpass as an overall film. Even anytime I would pick 'A Cat
in Paris' over this, but that does not make this one's a bad film.It kind of looks like the supernatural version of 'Eye in the Sky'. I'm
not talking about the actual film, but the concept of drones to watch
over the criminal activity. In here the boy acts as the main
communication device. He who one day wants to be a cop, helps to solve
the crime. I think the end should have been a little better. Especially
from the boy's perspective about how his tale ends were very
intentional. Perhaps a bit of emotions at the end would have given a
better result.I advertise the 2D animations too much on my blog whenever I review
them, because they are rapidly fading away art. So my big thanks to
those production houses and the filmmakers who still believe in it. If
you are an animation film fan, you will enjoy it, no matter you loved
it or not at the end. In a simple way to say, it is a fine film for the
families with kids aged ten or under. It might look like a typical
detective film, but entertaining with a few good moments. So check it
out if you get a chance to access it.7/10",0,2015
446,12.2,7.7,"You need to see this movie. That could be this entire review, but I
think I should describe how amazing this film is. Unlike most summer
movies, the writing is fantastic, keeping me and the rest of the people
watching with me attached to the movie and its characters even when
they are just talking in a diner or something. Also unlike most other
summer movies, the movie does not attempt to create artificial tension
in the form of fast cuts or stupid action scenes, it creates tension in
the form of dialogue and sometimes in the form of brilliantly filmed
action. It should be noted that the cinematography in this film is
truly amazing. The cinematography captures the desolateness and sadness
of the area of West Texas that the movie is set in. There are also many
wide shots, which looked like they were filmed with drones which also
added to the beauty of the filming. The music also adds to the western
feel of this movie. The writing of this film is where it really shines.
The writing is captivating and it is so natural, for the area. The
banter between both pairs of characters (the brothers and the rangers)
is very entertaining in that you can almost feel their relationship and
the history of it. Also, I have to say, the writing for the side
characters, who are only in the film for their respective scenes is
even better. This is the first time I have ever cared about some random
waitress who is only in the film for 90 seconds because their writing
is masterful. Also, the acting is definitely some of the best I have
seen, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges both really shine in the film because
of their stunning acting. The acting helps in that when Chris Pine and
Ben Foster are mid- heist you can really feel the stress when they get
into situations that one or both of them are not comfortable with. In
closing, this film has amazing writing, cinematography, acting, pacing,
everything. This film is just beautiful and you really need to see it,
like yesterday, it is easily the best film this year and a major
contender for Best Picture, Best Director, etc.",102,2016

448,5.0,7.8,"I am a pretty big fan of Laika. As a studio, they have brought a blend
of stop-motion and CGI into the mainstream and have also tested much
riskier subject material than other animation companies. Not only is
their animation time consuming and risky, but their ideas are fairly
risky as well (in today's market, that is).And Kubo is another interesting premise with beautiful animation,
gorgeous backgrounds, and a nice style to it. It looks really good.
Props to the animators. Stop-motion is advancing further and further
with every movie Laika is making, and the stuff that is done in this
movie would have seemed impossible to do only 7 years ago when Coraline
was first released.The first 20 minutes of this movie are excellent and well-told!However, beautiful animation does not make a good movie...Story is the heart of a movie, and if you don't know how to tell a
story, then you should go back to the drawing board (or storyboard).
The biggest issue with Kubo isn't the most obvious one. The characters
are nice, the animation is nice, the action is nice, and everything
feels pretty solid, but what really kills this movie is the editing,
the script, and its lack of solidity. In short: Kubo and the Two Strings doesn't know what it is.I could write a 10 page essay on the deeper issues of this movie, but
that doesn't fit in one IMDb review. In Kubo, and lot of interesting
ideas are brought up, but none of them fit together or are cohesive. For example, what is Kubo's motivation? Staying alive? Saving his mom?
Beating his grandpa? Kubo never really gets true motivation until the
third act and this is a major issue for the movie. The movie says Kubo
is on an adventure, but he doesn't seem to feel the stakes until the
final act, which is way too late in the game for us to care about him.The same goes with the villain. The background and motives of the
villain are constantly changing and inconsistent. One second he wants
to kill Kubo. Next second he wants his eye. Yet another second later,
he just wants to help Kubo come to heaven with him. Then he hates
everyone becomes they are human. Then his motives change to he just
hates human because they could overthrow him. Then another motive where
it is because he thinks they are disgrace.THIS IS A BIG ISSUE.For the villain's motivation and reasoning to be completely ambiguous
and confusing completely ruins Kubo's arc... which is equally confusing
and muddled. Essentially, both the villain and the protagonist are the
weakest points of this movie. A movie can't really hold together with
this big of a problem. And this issue is repeated throughout the movie where nothing is
actually fully realized. For example: there is one scene where Kubo briefly loses control of his
powers and it does something he didn't mean to do. Never mentioned
again in the movie.The plot of his mother being sick and needing to be taken care of.
Never fully explained or fully realized.Why the mom can't recognize her own husband when she sees his face? Why
does the mom pretend she isn't kubo's mom (she says it is so he won't
feel bad?!?!?). How come the mom told stories of the locations of all
of the MacGuffins, but then doesn't know where they are?What did the moon king want with Kubo's eyes? Why does the moon king
have Kubo's eye at the end when he is a human, but not when he is a
spirit being? Why does the moon king become a human? Why does the town
lie about his past? Why did Kubo trust the moon king in the dream, when
his whole journey is to beat the moon king, but then when he sees the
moon king he trusts him?*big spoilers* Why is there a red paper samurai? Why is there a red
paper samurai once the beetle shows up, who is the actual real-life
version of that samurai! Why didn't anyone recognize the beetle as the
father, especially when the father's samurai armor appears to be
sitting within that same cave? Why didn't anyone follow the red paper
samurai to the last location of the armor? They followed it the entire
time, but not at the end?Long story short, this list of character problems and inconsistencies
is much longer than this, but a lot of these are pretty big plot
problems and not just nit-picks. The finale of the movie is problem the
worst element of the movie and not because it isn't visually stunning,
but mostly because it is one character who has no tangible motivation
versus someone else who hasn't had a very clear goal throughout the
film. To make it worse, the movie doesn't even know what it is about.
Is it about memories? Is it about death? Is it about stuck-up snobs? Is
it an attack on tradition? Is it attacking perfectionists? What is the
movie about? What makes this all the more frustrating is the fact that ParaNorman is
a movie that has a similar premise, but it does it perfectly. The
ending of ParaNorman works, because all of its themes tie together
flawlessly. ParaNorman is a cohesive story and knows what it is saying. Kubo does
not.Sadly, if you are expecting the next Coraline or ParaNorman, then
prepare to be disappointed. This movie feels like a first-pass. A lot
of ideas, but none of them mesh together or are completed.",101,2016

director, even the cinematographer had been influenced -greatly- by
other films they had watched and he shows.This movie is almost like multiple movies thrown together and not
linked well at all. Another thing to note is the audio/sound guy, you

452,15.666666666666666,5.8,"It seems to me that 'Money' is a perfect, elegant and flawless product;
a very stylized classic drama. While I was watching it, movies like The
Rope (Alfred Hitchcock, 1948) or Wait Until Dark (Terence Young, 1967)
came to my mind. The movie is concise, pragmatic and straightforward.
Its goals are clear and they know how to reach them. Its message is, on
top of that, beautiful, illuminating and not indulgent. The tension is
built up in a superb manner for a movie that needs to keep us in
suspense. And the director's work with the actors is sublime. With
perhaps the exception of Kellan Lutz, more inexpressive, they are all
splendid, and that makes the text shine and the credibility of what is
taking place escalate. In that sense, the actor's direction is
spectacular. At times, the necessity of filming hastily is noticeable,
but not so much because of the editing, which is perfect, with just
some isolated glimpses that can be observed. However, it is more
noticeable in the staging: it looks like there wasn't time to plan a
proper communicative meaning beyond what's functional. There is not a
genuine relationship between the characters and the space, not a single
shot provides more information than what the characters verbally
announce. It would have been a spectacular movie if they had taken more
risks in that sense. It would have been even better if they had what
every movie lacks of: time! But, in spite of that, everything in
'Money' is believable, accurate and intense. Concision, focusing on a
single location, a right pace in the dialogues, witty replicas and
great performances are but a few of its virtues. In that sense, 'Money'
is a complete success.",86,2016

genre and I really enjoyed it for some reasons. I like the visual
performance of it - it's a new look for Seagal movie and it's with no
doubt stylish and fresh. I like the characters and how they were played
- what is rare as we are judging directly to video production - I
didn't notice any that was odd or stupid but all the characters were
well written and played. That of course was a nice surprise and that is
a sign of solid production. Every sustainable character was in its
place and actors did really fit. I ask everybody here not to judge The
Perfect weapon in terms of A-list movies because of inappropriate
levels of budgets, promotion, stuff etc. But in a raw of directly to
video movies its really decent piece of art that makes a better
impression IMHO than preliminary waiting. An effect was multiplied
keeping in mind Steven's recent outcomes that were fairly blamed and
crashed by fans. I would say comparing to Sniper: special ops, The
Asian connection, Code of honor this flick is a really masterpiece
(once again tribute to its budget, short shooting period and young
director who makes his first steps in action genre). I base my
statement on my personal impression during watching it. I mean that
during watching ordinary directly to video you decrease the scale of
your inner critic to accept the faults every time you suffer from some
trademark lacks in professionalism that are usual things for this type
of flicks. You just say to yourself: ""Oh my Lord, they made that crappy
stunt, doubling, editing, dialogue once again. When they stop treat us
like that?"" Rings the bell, guys? Thats why I rate The Perfect weapon
high because I didn't feel like that during all the showtime. So my
congratulations and many thanks to T. Paar and the crew who made a
really entertaining flick with no excuses to the limits. Really good
start in Hollywood for director. As for Steven's performance I truly
believe that it was his best cameo after his appearance in Machete.
Just watch his scenes with no prejudice, he really looks naturally and
dedicated to his character. We got used to the opposite for the last

him the role that fit his physical and mental personality very well so

story of young, entrepreneur gun-runners David Parkouz and Efraim
Diveroli who managed to secure a ridiculous contract to supply arms to
the afghan army via the pentagon. Miles Teller plays the struggling and ambitious David who bumps into
his childhood buddy Efraim played by Jonah Hill who is somewhat of the
opposite, a loose cannon, fearless and a little trigger-happy. Now,
Efraim has found himself a little niche in the market, the market of
arms dealing and strikes up small deals with the US military. David
needs a job to support his expecting girlfriend, the stunning Ana de
Armas who looks a little like Penelope Cruz only more beautiful and has
one of those exotic accents. Efraim sees an opportunity for David and
the two team up to what leads to the deal of the century for all
parties involved. Now, the film has plenty of other film references most notably
Scarface, even one of the promotional posters is a respectful nod to
the DePalma/Pacino's film. But it's actually Lord of War Efraim is a
huge fan of in real-life and it's probably more like Lord of War than
Scarface, yet it has tinge of Pain & Gain, another crazy true story
movie. Maybe it's Miami? But it has that vibrant and funny yet serious
storytelling style that makes the film almost unbelievable and
shocking. The rest of the cast does include Bradley Cooper who also produced the
film, playing the harden, borderline war-criminal, pretty much the
Branson of the arms market and someone you don't really want to be
messing with. There's Kevin Pollack playing the bankroll and an awesome
cameo of venture capitalist playboy millionaire Dan Bilzerian. It's accompanied by a great soundtrack with tracks from 50cent, Beastie
Boys, Iggy Pop, UB40 and CCR but the awesome score threw me completely
thinking it was Harry Gregson-Williams or Steve Jablonski, no, it was
Cliff Martinez with those ambient sounds. The film is highly entertaining, funny in parts but this is not a
comedy; its perfectly paced with some great scenes like the duo
gun-running across the triangle of death and some nice camera work.

by his side, Duran (known as ""Manos de Piedra"" Hands of Stone) claims
the WBC welterweight title in 1980 over state-side favorite Sugar Ray
Leonard (well portrayed by the at times too pretty Usher - The Voice),
only to later utter the words ""No mas"" (no more), walking away from a
rematch. Superbly guiding Duran through his life/career is training
great Ray Arcel (the always terrific Robert De Niro), money man Carlos
(Ruben Blades - Safe House) and childhood funny man Chaplain (Oscar
Jaenada - Cantinflas). While several side stories are briefly
presented, they help Jakubowicz elevate the film from just a boxing
movie. Music by Angelo Mili, cinematography (Miguel Loann Litton Menz),
costumes (Bina Daigeler) and set decoration by Denise Camargo and Amy
Williams (especially the Disco scene) bring the film to life. Reg E.
Cathey (Don King) and the younger Duran (David Arosemena) have nice
smaller roles, as does one of my all time favorites Ellen Barkin
(Animal Kingdom) as Ray's wife. ""Get into the ring"" with this elevated

in a southern role was a moment of challenge but I got over it and let

462,8.5,4.5,"It's a good movie because the ambition of the director is reached
appropriately. Some directors want to talk about something big and
finally their visuals, audio, story couldn't fulfill. But this one just
talks about (strange) sex and love openly. This movie touches upon gay
love, war teared couple apart, love at first sight, woman's sex desire,
love failed against money, a woman who has lot of casual sex because
she's never had an orgasm, future sex robot, love with a ghost, corpse
in a bag and many other things. And the signs, key phrases follow
through adequately throughout the movie. And ultimately, it ends with a
beautiful love story. Yes, the room, or maybe the world has become a
ruin. But with love, it could be beautiful. Normally, I dislike movies
with ""roomy"" sounds. It gives movies an unprofessional feeling. But
this movie uses it intentionally, reasonably.One may argue this movie feels very ""low-budgeted"", ""no-stars"" and the
topics involved are too obscene. But in my opinion, it's brave to put
everything that straight to the viewers' eyes. And it's a breakthrough
story-wise for an Asian movie considering it fit the whole bunch of
pan-Asian casts into the plot which still feels reasonable.The more I think about it, the more I like this movie.",90,2015
463,14.0,2.5,"It's illuminating, I think, to consider the fact that ""bad"" movies have
as much complexity and dimensionality, in their way, as ""good"" movies.
After all, there are nearly as many facets to a bad movie is there are
to a good movie. Just like a good movie, a bad movie must have music,
sound effects, visual effects, a story, actors and acting, lighting,
recording, editing, and so on.In the same way that you could take an entire university course on what
made ""Citizen Kane"" a great movie, you COULD similarly take such a
course on what made ""American Conjuring"" a bad movie. You wouldn't want
to do it, of course, but the point is that there would be that much
information to study and learn about what made it such an incredibly
awful picture.That being the case, it would take far more than the space I have here
to fully elaborate on the depth and breadth of the execrable- ness of
this movie.But I will make one observation. For every human endeavor, and
especially in art of any kind, sometimes an example is so incredibly
appalling that it makes you feel bad for the people involved with it.
You get the sense that they've ""been punished enough"" by simply being
associated with such a steaming pile that you don't want to be
responsible for adding to their misery. Let them mercifully scatter
into the dark and concealing night.""American Conjuring"" ALMOST achieves that forgivable state. Almost.The reason it DOESN'T is because the movie is CALLED ""American
Conjuring"". Anyone with a suspicious mind might think that the creators
of this movie were attempting to capitalize on the success of other
relatively recent but unrelated movies that have the word ""conjuring""
in their titles, and that they were hoping to confuse people into
paying good money to watch this fly-blown manure accidentally. This
would suggest evil intent and malice aforethought rather than a sad and
hapless set of talentless people tragically exposed for their
artlessness.Personally, I'm not suspicious of such a thing at all. Nope. Not
suspicious.The sound and video masters for this movie need to be taken out on a
moonless night and buried deep beneath cursed ground, sprinkled with
salt, and hosed down with holy water. I'm precluded from suggesting
what should happen to the people responsible for it.",86,2016
464,11.2,5.4,"It sounds interesting enough: Pierce Brosnan plays an airline tycoon

rather obsessed with getting into his daughter Kaitlyn's), and when he
tries to get rid off him, this guy turns their smart house against

possibly being the first time I've seen the story done in this era of
all smart phones having a camera and everyone on social media (but I'm
sure there exist a another movie that has done that before this one),
the story itself is predictable and unimaginative enough that it
overshadows the updated concept. Pierce Brosnan is very good in a really bad movie. I'm not sure what
that really means. Usually when an actor is driving a crap vehicle, it
only showcases what a great driver the actor can be, but in this case
the vehicle was too crappy to actually do that. It evens out for both

467,14.0,6.9,"Fitting certain decades into neat little categories are repeated often
enough that they have become unquestioned clichés, for example, the 50s
were an age of conformity, the 60s an age of youth revolt, and the 70s
the so-called ""Me Generation."" As in all generalizations, there is some
aspect of truth even when there is a different reality that does not
fit into the stereotypes. Based on the novel by Philip Roth, first-time
director James Schamus' Indignation is the story of an individual who
was willing to challenge prevailing attitudes. Marcus Messner (Logan
Lerman) is a young Jewish intellectual brought up in a liberal
environment who struggles to find his voice in an Ohio college that is
a bastion of social conservatism.Set in 1951 in Newark, N.J., tired of having to cope with the anxieties
of his parents, dad Max (Danny Burstein), a kosher butcher, and mom
Esther (Linda Emond) about going off to fight in the Korean War, Marcus
enrolls on a scholarship to the fictional Winesburg College in Ohio, a
school whose social and cultural attitudes present a hefty challenge.
Marcus is intellectually precocious but socially constrained and
sexually repressed and the breakout performance by Logan Lerman (""The
Perks of Being a Wallflower"") fully captures him in all his Rothian
complexity.The fact that he has two Jewish roommates, Bert (Ben Rosenfield) and
Ron (Philip Ettinger) is of very little comfort since they are both
obnoxious hypocrites. Marcus is very cautious about his social
activities, declining an invitation by Sonny Cottler (Pico Alexander)
to join the Jewish fraternity. When he goes on a date with Olivia
Hutton (Sarah Gadon), an ""experienced"" blond-haired Gentile who shocks
him by performing oral sex on him, an action in which the confused
Marcus wasn't sure if he was coming or going. Overly concerned about
what may have been the damage to his Cadillac LaSalle that Marcus
borrowed, Ron reacts by punching his roommate in the mouth. Needless to
say, this does not endear him to his dorm mates and prompts Marcus to
find quieter living arrangements - by himself.This action prompts a call from the self-righteous Dean Caudwell (Tracy
Letts) to come in for an interview that takes fifteen minutes of screen
time, a tour-de-farce (sic) which is both sad and funny and a master
class in turning verbal sparring into an art form. While the Dean takes
a welcome interest in Marcus, the interview turns into a riff on the
Spanish Inquisition as the student is bombarded with questions about
his application for school - why his father's occupation was listed as
""butcher"" rather than as ""kosher butcher,"" why he did not put Jewish as
his religious preference, why he couldn't work out his differences with
his roommates, and why he has had only one date since school started.
The only thing he wasn't asked is whether or not he was circumcised.Sputtering and obsequious at first, Marcus gains strength as the
interview goes on. Showing that, as Romain Rolland put it in
""Jean-Christophe,"" he is not a sheep but a wolf that has teeth and
wasn't made for the pasture, he lets the good Dean know in no uncertain
terms that, as an atheist, he resents being forced to attend chapel
services at least ten times a year and vigorously asserts his atheism
by citing Bertrand Russell (whose character the Dean attacks), and lets
the old boy know that he is his own man and that if he wants to move
away from his insufferable roommates, he will do just that. Vomiting on
the Dean's trophies and collapsing from the pain of an appendicitis
attack was not in his plan, however, but life has a way of deciding the
lessons it wants to teach.Marcus is unwilling to let the good times roll and his relationship
with Olivia takes a darker turn when he finds out that she has had a
troubled past and once tried to commit suicide, though we never learn
any details. Though their connection is deep and Marcus is a young man
whose head is screwed on right, his continued revolt against authority
and conflict with his parents does not serve him well. As philosopher
Henri Bergson said, ""Each step of the journey is made by following the
heart instead of following the crowd and by choosing knowledge over the
veils of ignorance."" Though Indignation is a slow burn that keeps the
lid on its emotions, it ultimately succeeds in moving us deeply. Much
more than another corporate product with an uplifting message to make
sure that waterworks turn into greenbacks, it is a sincere and
heartfelt film that illuminates the struggle against a suffocating
conformity, a struggle that is just as relevant today as it was in
1950.",110,2016
468,9.25,4.9,"The original Kickboxer is one of the best classical fighting movies of
all time, this on the other hand is a disgrace. I was really looking
forward to seeing this, with the likes of Van Damme and Dave Batista. The film starts out actually very well, with some good fight scenes,
however as the film progresses, it becomes a complete mess. With
dreadful dialogue. There were many scenes, mainly which included any
romance, were poorly acted, written and executed. They were unbearably
cheesy. The directing in this movie is also bad, with a lot of shaky
cam, and over the top scenes. One of the worst parts of this movie, is
by far the fight scene which involved elephants. Not only was the CGI
on them the worst in history of a film released after 2000, but the
scene seemed forced and unnecessary.Like most martial arts film, this film sufferers from, good looks. They
cast the most attractive actor/actress they can find, who can't act
worth a damn, and throw them into a film. The original film had great
characters, these are cardboard cutouts. There are only two things this film has going for it, one of them in
the cinematography. Mateo Londono the person behind this, is way out of
this film's league, his shots are beautiful, with some stunning
lighting effects and unique angles.The other is obviously Van Damme, he is very good here, maybe a little
too good. Van has never been the best actor, but he outshines everyone
here, which says something. However his character was not that great.
In the original, the Master was a quiet, well mannered, wise and
powerful teacher, Van Damme he is none of those. Yes he has some
kickass fight scenes, but when he is mentoring, he has none of the
wisdom the previous one had.This film is gunk, and I would suggest no person to watch this, unless
you are drunk and out of your 'Damme' mind. It is a poorly shot, acted,
written and executed mess, with dreadful dialogue, poor characters,
awful editing and horrific CGI.2.1/10",90,2016

following The Cheerleaders, The Swinging Cheerleaders, and Revenge of
the Cheerleaders. It's also the third in a row of a movie that features
one Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith. She plays Roxanne here (though I don't
remember her name ever being called in the film) and unlike the last
two, she's not starring, only supporting or maybe ""a glorified cameo""
would be more like it since her appearances don't really have to do
with the main action. The main cheerleaders featured here are Sally
(Lisa Reeves) and Laurie (Jennifer Ashley). Sally is the blonde one who
was once involved with Duane (Bill Adler) but then falls for one
football player named Johnnie (Robert Carradine in a role much
different from his later familiar one in Revenge of the Nerds!). Laurie
is the brunette one who eventually warms to fellow pigskin player Jesse
(Michael Mullins). Jessie himself previously liked to fool around as he
does with Roxanne and a car hop girl named Sue Ann (Susan Player)
before getting involved with Laurie. Unlike the other cheerleader
movies I previously reviewed, the sex-while there-isn't emphasized too
much. In fact, while The Cheerleaders was a sex farce through and
through, The Swinging Cheerleaders went back and forth between comedy
and drama, and Revenge of the Cheerleaders was a contrived chaotic
mess, The Pom Pom Girls seemed more life-like in presenting the teen
hijinks and seeing how some friendships and relationships develop
overtime despite some still contrived moments like the football game
devolving into a free-for-all fight! And, yes, some scenes do borrow
from some classic movies like the ""chicken run"" that does have a
character mention James Dean and his Rebel Without a Cause. My favorite
was a food fight scene that has Carradine and Adler taking their time
in Laurel-and-Hardy slow burn-like fashion. Oh, and the '70s music
soundtrack sounds just like the kind of songs one would hear on AM
radio in those days. It should be noted that Crown International
Pictures-perhaps one of the most successful of the drive-in
distributors-was responsible for this and they always made many quite
enjoyable B-type movies of this genre like Malibu Beach (which also
featured Susan Player) and The Van (which also featured Bill Adler).
Oh, and the director of this may surprise you if you're more familiar
with his suspense movies like The Stepfather or Sleeping with the

reached their biggest success very early in their career, this one here

documentaries they worked on together and the focus here is, as the
title already tells us, on reefs. Honestly, reefs are crucial from an
environmental perspective as they are the basis of life for so many
animals, but I myself struggled a bit with this documentary as
underwater fauna has never been a subject that interested me too much.
That's why my 6 out of 10 rating is pretty subjective and people who
find the subject more appealing may very well give it a higher rating
and I would not be surprised. It is definitely a documentary film that
is well-executed, offers occasionally interesting snippets of

to suffer through, so I guess the label 'horror' was accurate in that
sense, but in the sense of it being a scary movie, not so much.""Stormhouse"" starts off with indicating ""This film was inspired by real
events"". Yeah, then that makes me Elvis Presley incarnated. So they
want us to believe that the British military had managed to capture a
spirit entity from the afterlife? And to make matters even worse, keep
it secured in a small fenced yard? Right! Lets see, spirit entities are
incorporeal and ethereal, meaning they would be able to traverse in any
direction and even through solid matter. But still, the director wanted
us to believe that a chain-linked fence (without a roof) was sufficient
to hold such a supernatural entity at bay?Moving on. And for a military base, it is without a doubt the most
unlit installation in the history of military bases. I have never seen
such lack of lighting anywhere. And I found it highly unrealistic and
questionable that a military force would keep their base shrouded in
perpetual darkness. And it just didn't help the movie one bit either,
as most of the time we can hardly see what is going on because of the
poor (well, lack of) lighting in almost every scene.As for being a 'horror' movie, then ""Stormhouse"" was really a major
disappointment, as there were no scares in it at all - probably because
we couldn't see what was going on as there wasn't sufficient lighting
anywhere. And also, the entire story was just so very implausible that
it didn't work out on any level.I am a big fan of horror movies, and I do like supernatural movies, but
this one was just too much waste of time and effort. There are far
better ghost movies available on the market. Actually, you might even
be better off (and more entertained) by movies such as those awful
""Paranormal Activity"" movies. But still, they were better than this
one.One thing that ""Stormhouse"" had working for it, though, was the people
they had cast for the various roles. Most of them actually did good
enough jobs in acting, but nothing really memorable here though.It wasn't very far into the movie before I started to do other stuff
while the movie was playing; SMS texting and cleaning up the living
room. The story in ""Stormhouse"" is just unfathomable uninteresting and
unappealing. If you like horror movies or ghost movies, ""Stormhouse""
might not be a good choice. I was bored senseless.",88,2011

483,10.5,3.1,"The title of this movie matches perfectly. Everything from the
dialogue, script, plot, acting, and even the tone of the film is dead.
From the very start, the tone and vibe of this movie feels off. What
should feel like a Western movie, somehow comes off as a mixture of the
modern and past, but failing as if it doesn't know which one it's
trying to be. In the end, it's really neither, and just a movie with
low budget sets that don't fit the feel of the movie whatsoever. Not
only do the sets feel out of place, the entire feel of the movie does
too. It's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and yet they still have
vehicles and a few other modern devices. Why is this set up like a
Western then? It's all over the place.Aside from the tone and feel of the movie being off, the writing is
atrocious. Nick Carter should stick to writing songs, because the only
thing about this movie that was good was the song they all sang
together for the credits. The plot is so weak, that you're not even
sure what it is. There is a villain, but there is so little back story
on every character in this film, that it's nonexistent. It seems like
some cheap story a five year old tried to write up for a class
assignment, and even a five year old could probably write better.Beyond that, the acting is darn right awful. Aside from small notes
like AJ McLean, whose Johnny Vermillion character probably brought the
most to the table, the other actors are just horrible. Even then, the
only amusement he offers is his funny laugh throughout that sounds like
Batman's Joker has asthma. Otherwise, everyone in this movie is
horrific. Facial expressions are absent, while dialogue is off and
completely weak. Nothing in this movie fits the way it should.Everything felt forced and some of the plots seemed to be Nick Carter's
idea of wish fulfillment. Maybe he would have fulfilled his deepest
desires if he could actually play a decent lead, but instead his
one-liners are something left to be desired, and you WANT him to die in
this movie, just like every other character. Of course, that's within
the first five minutes of the film, and sadly not everyone is
introduced within the first five minutes, but you want them dead
anyways. They're THAT bad once they come onto the screen. All in all, this movie isn't even a decent B movie. It's just idiotic
and a waste of time. Seriously, these boy band members should have just
teamed up for the song, or went on tour together and made a band called

because I am lazy. However, due to the current reviews out there that
led me to watch this film to begin with I have to comment on it: My
review of 'Bleeding Hearts': This movie was held out to be a reckoning
point for women in prostitution. It has been said that Mamet's
performance was the quintessential definition of a woman accepting
herself for what she is and not caring what anyone else thinks about
her. (who only had like 4 lines relating to how she actually felt about
it).After watching the film, however, I would like to disagree on several
key points. Though Mamet's performance was definitely noteworthy, it
had nothing to do with her profession as an on-again off-again
'massage' therapist.This was a story of a woman caught in a shitty relationship with an
abusive partner. A story that is far to common in real life. To reduce
the plot to simply a story of a woman trapped in prostitution and
looking for a way out is not only insulting to both Mamet and Biel, who
were great in this, not to mention the writer, but, I think, also
misses the larger message of the entire film itself, which is: that no
matter what you think, if you are in an abusive relationship, there is
always a way out, even if you can't see it yourself. This is definitely
a film worth watching.",80,2015
489,7.0,7.2,"""Humpback Whales"" is one of the most recent works by nature documentary
filmmakers Greg MacGillivray (two-time Oscar nominee) and Stephen
Judson. It is from last year and like most of their works, the title is
already a giveaway what this film is about. It runs for slightly under
40 minutes and focuses on humpback whales, a breed of animals that is
still endangered (and probably always will be). We get an insight into
how they try to survive against whalers coming for them, how people
work to keep them from going extinct, how their mating behaviors look
like and how new generations learn about this very special breed of
whales. But is it really very special? I must say I am a bit
disappointed by the filmmakers' take on the subject in this short
documentary. It is a subject that has a lot more to offer I believe and
the way they made it for the masses (also with the somewhat
cringeworthy music used in here), it sometimes felt like a missed
opportunity. The reason I say that is that it is not half as
informative or relevant as it could have been. But this is nothing
really new when it comes to IMAX movies. Still, it is not a weak or
even bad film by any means at all and (also as usual) some of the video
footage is pretty great in here. I give it a thumbs-up and recommend

didn't really explain what was going on, but through actions and
dialogue it gave the viewers the background story.The three characters have no chemistry and they act stiff around one
another. The character of the psychic, Holly, played by Laura Peterson,
is clichè: dark, moody, etc.Jed Brophy's character doesn't say much. Jeffery Thomas was pretty
good, but, again, there was the problem of the interaction between the
only three actors in the film. It was stilted and boring.Back to Laura Peterson: the girl cannot act. In a role where terror and
anxiety is necessary, she misses the mark completely. I've seen 5 year
olds pull off terror better than her.My family and I stopped watching the movie 3/4 of the way in because of
a malfunction. We weren't upset. I noticed my 14 year old horror
fanatic was fast asleep.The scare factor was null, the suspense was just long waits while
characters walk down the hall.Good idea for a film, started with a promise, died a slow, boring

make sure that you are also high when you are watching the film.It is a typical average film. The story is predictable, and there was
nothing unique about the script. And also there was no twist or

committed by one of the friends.What this turns out to be is an effective effects showcase packed with
gory kills that really push the boat out when it comes to practical

most interesting actor working in indie horror cinema today. Oberst Jr.
looks like William Sadler and is just as imposing in the roles he

we get are an unfunny comedy and a rubber crocodile monster movie. In
this day and age, we should be able to do better with the special

that is pivotal to the plot, at least do it right. The croc looks like
it was built out of leftover Wellingtons and if it took a bite out of

it's all loose and floppy.There are also some dismembered body parts that also suffer from the no
bone syndrome, I've never seen a floppier leg. These atrocious effects
are the only thing that's funny in this movie as writers, Michael
Anderson and Nick Squire, aren't the best at writing comedy and it

comedy falls flat on its face - and not in a good way like slapstick.Michael Anderson who also directed this picture doesn't seem to be able

worthy social drama about how young men sent to prison cope with their
prison history when they're out. Critical acclaim and award ceremonies
would have followed. Instead, it's packed with macho violence, swearing
and drag queens. So fewer filmsnob points, but probably more box office
success.It's Australia (in the 1970s, judging from the outfits). Ex-con
'Sparra' (the personable Alex Russell) is going straight and working in
a broom factory when an old mucker from prison, 'Pommie' (Sullivan
Stapleton) turns up. Pommie quickly inveigles his way into the home of
Sparra and fiancée Paula, despite the former's reluctance - it is clear
there is some prison-based connection between the pair, a connection
Pommie is determined will continue. Meanwhile, his violent tendencies
come to the fore.Although it is fairly obvious early on what the connection is between
Pommie and Sparra, this isn't explicitly stated until late in the film
- meaning the viewer cannot be sure s/he fully understands Pommie and
Sparra's motivations. But other aspects of the story rattle along at a
fair old pace. As for the acting, Russell does well enough in
portraying Sparra's confusion, but Stapleton seems so intent on
channeling every one-note psycho who has ever featured on screen that
by the time his big emotional scene rolls around it is hard to take him
seriously. Still, caught as it is between the two genres of social
drama and action thriller, 'Cut Snake' is an entertaining film and I

movie went straight to cable on the SyFy Channel, one certainly should
get the idea that we are not dealing with ""Gone with the Wind"" here,
but with a silly monster movie. But there is still a place for that.
Sometimes some of us have had it with too many serious things in life
and we just want to watch something light and silly, and movies like
these fill that urge. The fact that several of us voted to watch it
proves the point.The good points? The rivalry between the two main actresses at times
was interesting. The rest of the movie sort of went along with
expectations. And by that I mean, the acting and drama did not even get
to good, the special effects did not rival Jurassic Park, and no
university professor (who is not high) is going to buy the explanation
for the larger monsters and how they got that way. The bottom line is,
if you are in the mood for something that you know is not serious nor
pretends to be serious, this might fill some time for you.Regrets from me after watching it? Some movies that know they are not
the big time sometimes reach cult classic fame with the right amount of
silliness and interest such as ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"". I think
this movie tried for that category also, but I do not feel it achieved
that either. But I give it credit for being honest as to what it really
was - a non serious monster movie.",91,2011
504,11.0,8.0,"That's the biggest moral dilemma this movie puts in front of its characters.
It falls to the President (ably played by Henry Fonda) to make the agonizing
decision of how to handle the situation without causing a global
thermonuclear war.From the Soviet point of view, here's what happens. The hot line in Moscow
rings. The premier picks it up to hear the American president explaining
that three unstoppable bombers are on their way to obliterate Moscow. Oh,
but it was an accident. We didn't mean to send them out, sorry. And we
can't call them back, because they're beyond their fail safe position (and
thus are trained to maintain complete radio silence and ignore any
communication they may receive), and we can't shoot them down because
they're way out of our range. Sorry. Our bad.The pacing of the movie moves from a calm, cool tone while various media
figures are shown around the facility in charge of all the bombers. Then it
picks up a tiny bit as the facility detects a bogie over Hudson Bay. And
this is where the situation begins that eventually leads to the erroneous
deployment of a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Although it seems
small at the time, this is the metaphorical horseshoe nail that loses the
kingdom. (""For want of a nail...."") From this point, the movie steadily
increases the suspence as progressively more drastic measures are taken in
the effort to stop these bombers, with the situation growing more desperate
by the moment. I started out firmly positioned on my seat, but by the end I
had moved further and further forward towards the edge of my seat until
eventually I couldn't even sit still. Too much suspense.There are quite a lot of technical errors in the film (for instance, due to
the Air Force refusing to assist in the film, they had to resort to a fairly
limited set of stock footage for the shots of aircraft, which are thus
extremely inaccurate) but it remains a good movie. If you can ignore the
errors in set design and stock footage and concentrate instead on the dialog
(which is where the action is anyway), watching people rise to the challenge

suitable to make actual cartoon movies with Garfield. We got our wish
with this film and a couple others. A pity some people view this as
even worse. Looking back, I used to love ""Garfield"" when I was a kid.
It's weird, because now I just don't associate with it at all anymore.
I guess you could say I just outgrew it, but it's more than that. I can
look back at stuff like ""Peanuts"" or ""Sesame Street"" and be impressed
at how it holds up as an adult.Garfield just comes off as boring to me nowadays. So the fact that this
film was lacking in laughs in every way imaginable made it seem like a
pretty faithful adaptation. Most of this story is dumb. There's a
couple good moments, but it's mostly spoiled by terrible CGI. These
characters are just plain ugly to look at. The biggest saving grace is
Frank Welker as superhero Garfield. He reuses the Nibbler voice from

508,17.0,7.0,"""Boy, have we got a vacation for you...where nothing can go wrong!""Well, as the old saying goes...""famous last words.""""Westworld"" is supposed to be set in the future (as visualized back in
1973 when the film was made, apparently the computers of the future are
really, really big, and the monitors are really, really small, lol),
where pampered rich folk can go to a vacation resort named ""Delos"",
where they choose one of three ""worlds"" to visit and interact in:
Medieval World, Roman World, and Westworld. Our protagonists John
Blaine and Peter Martin (played by James Brolin and Richard Benjamin,
respectively) choose Westworld. John is a Westworld veteran, having
visited many times. Peter is his friend and first-timer at the resort;
uttering childlike statements such as ""Do we get a real gun? Wow!"" In
the various ""worlds"", the guests interact with each other and with
anatomically-correct, extremely realistic robots. They are able to
*ahem* interact very closely with the female robots, and also shoot the
mean robots for fun (the guns they are supplied with will not work on
real people) as they wish. A real ""cowboys and indians"" scenario for
the child in us all. Roman World is promoted as a big sex resort, and
Medieval World is geared towards the romantic, it seems.The film starts out with quite a lot of intentional comedy and satire,
and frankly starts out very much like it could have been a 1970's TV
""Movie of the Week"", but once the robots start to go bad...what we have
for the rest of the film is a truly creepy western/sci-fi film. It's a
gunfight! Albeit a Sci-Fi one. The last half-hour of the film is
essentially a silent movie, as Crichton said he wanted, save for the
great soundtrack, which sounds something like a bow being drawn against
piano strings, or a cello; anyway it has the same unsettling effect as
the out-of-tune piano in another classic, ""Wait Until Dark"" (1967).Movies with robots/androids...there have been many I have seen and
loved. But for this review I will cite examples of what I consider to
be scary robots in film, besides ""Westworld"": ""The Stepford Wives""
(1974), ""Alien"" (1979), ""Blade Runner"" (1982), ""The Terminator"" (1984),
""Aliens"", ""The Companion"" (1995). But ""Westworld"" was the first scary robot film I ever saw. And even
after the others that followed, nothing quite equals Yul Brynner in his
role as the gunslinger robot gone bad in ""Westworld."" His performance
is what really makes the movie. Brynner was a good actor, and even
(aybe especially) playing a machine, his skill is used to great effect.
His performance was anything but wooden (unlike the always wooden
Ah-nold in ""The Terminator"", for instance). When Brynner's robot gunslinger commands ""Draw"", with the slightest
twist at the corner of his mouth, he is completely creepy and scary.
Even the way he walks when hunting down Richard Benjamin's character
has an element to it that I have never seen again. What's also great about this film is the development of Benjamin's
character of Peter Martin. He starts out as the inexperienced nerdy
sidekick to Brolin's John Blaine, and ends up showing his true mettle
as the going gets rough. The nerdy naive Martin quickly learns how to
survive. This was Sci-Fi writer/director Michael Crichton's first foray into
big-screen film-making. Crichton has said he made the film in thirty
days. I would expect that finding pre-made sets were easy at least;
there was bound to be at least a western set sitting around the studio
lots. And of course, back then there were fewer and less complicated
special effects.If you find a DVD of this to rent, and you've never seen the film
before, I recommend that you do not watch the trailer first! It's a
real spoiler.Note: Look for Majel Barrett (of ""Star Trek-Generations"", and she is
also Gene Roddenberrys' widow) as the whorehouse madam. Brynner's part was a play on his role in the classic western film ""The
Magnificent Seven.""",88,1973
509,7.5,0.0,"I'm not sure if the Spawn comics really can be adapted to a film
medium. To sum it up: you have a murdered CIA hit-man who makes a deal
with a devil, comes back as deformed creature with strange powers, and
has to deal with a psychotic demon in clown form. Umm, yeah. Maybe Sam
Raimi or Guillermo Del Toro could'be made such a film, but alas, they
didn't, and the result is an inept production.I'll start with the good points; John Leguizamo is perfect as the
Clown; both over the top and malevolent. And a few of the visual
effects are impressive. And there were a few nods to the comics (Sam
and Twitch making a cameo at the end). But that's about it. Here's
every other problem: 1. Michael Jai White just sucks as the lead. He's terrible. His
interpretation of Spawn is not particularly heroic, or anti-heroic, or
likable, or has any character moments, but is just an angry guy
yelling: ""I'mma gonna kill Wynn! Arrgg!! These powers rock!"" Gone are
any of the philosophical underpinnings of the character.2. Hell and the devil Malebolia - laughable, laughable. They could've
at least animated the devil's mouth to move in sync with his voice. If
this is hell, I just laugh at it. And for those who say ""Hey, it was
1997; those were the visual effects of the time,"" I say look at
Independence Day, Space Jam, and Titanic, all films made around the
same time with superior effects.3. Martin Sheen, whom we all know is a good actor, adds little to the
Wynn character. He concocts an idiotic plot about inserting a bomb in
his heart, so that no one will dare kill him. This plot line isn't in
the comics, but even if it was it would still've been idiotic. Doctors
are really going to insert a bomb in someone's heart and not think:
""Gee, this guy's gonna die someday, so there's no question this bomb
will go off and kill people someday?"" 4. Child actor Miko Hughes shows up in a subplot, and has to look for
Spawn's dog. WTF? It's like the producers realized ""We should make this
more family friendly by giving Spawn a kid sidekick,"" but then realized
there really wasn't anything he could do, so they had him go look for a
dog instead.5. And after all this, we have a mess of a climax. Spawn fights off the
Clown in Hell by transporting through the fireplace! And then we get
the big cliché about ending with a shot of Spawn looking out on the
city he will now protect. Please. An unsatisfying ending, due to zero
character development or reason to care about any of the ""saving"" that
Spawn did throughout the movie.But there is some good in the world: after all, I walked out of this
knowing that if any demonic Clown comes after me, I sure can count on
Spawn to decapitate him for me. And if my dog ever runs away, I can
count on Miko Hughes to find him for me. And if I ever get confused
during a movie, I can count on Nicol Williamson's tacked-on voice-over
to provide exposition.And finally, if I ever go to hell, I know I can look forward to a place
filled with cartoon characters. YEE HEE!",0,1997
510,11.2,6.6,"Like every film Clint Eastwood makes, ""Midnight in the Garden of Good
and Evil"" is fascinated by the mystery of masculinity: what it means to
be a man, and what you have to do to be the kind of man you think you
need to be -- whether that's a father, a member of a cultural group, or
the ideal man in a certain social situation. Two highly-acclaimed
recent Eastwood films -- ""Mystic River"" and ""Million-Dollar Baby"" --
mildly disappointed me by sinking into oversimplification and
predictability. Possibly Eastwood's directing hand is more interesting
when less ""self-assured,"" because 1997's ""Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil"" follows these questions down less well-defined, and thus
less predictable, paths. Maintaining a scrupulously neutral eye, the
film recounts a complex tale of murder, involving characters who are
recognizable types on the surface but carry deep difference underneath.
It unfurls a slow, rich, and troubling narrative which answers the
mysteries of its crime premise even as it opens much more difficult
questions about the very things that murder stories are supposed to
make simple: innocence, guilt, motivations, affection, and its
characters' so-called morality.Thanks in large part to a literally mesmerizing performance by Kevin
Spacey (I'm riveted every time he appears on screen) and a well-
balanced turn by John Cusack as the sympathetic investigating reporter,
who charms us even as he maintains a total and focused receptivity to
new information and strange events, the movie fills its two and a half
hours with a slow-paced and carefully balanced story that brings us
into the suffocating green world of Southern Gothic, with its all its
mannered refinements, thick silences and passionate secrets. There's
something in this film that would have pleased Tennessee Williams or
Truman Capote, those cool-eyed investigators of the closeted South.
John Berendt's nuanced book, Spacey's restrained, smoldering
performance and Eastwood's lucidly hands-off direction have created a
strange, slow gem of a film. It's not a gem appreciated by everyone,
but two years before Spacey's turn in ""American Beauty"" struck a chord
that resonated with the wider public, ""Midnight in the Garden"" asks
similar questions in a context that is, at the same time, more precise,
more exotic, and equally American.",155,1997

515,6.0,6.9,"There are a lot of good movies out there. Hell, there are even some
damn near perfect ones, but there are only a small handful of films
that fall into the legendary category. These films that have become
legend only come around once in a blue moon, but when they do, they
tend to hit an emotional cord and stick around forever. I'm sure we can
talk for days about what movies fall into this category, but there is
one film in particular that definitely belongs here, and I'm willing to
bet dollars to donuts that you've never even heard of it, nor seen it.
Reason being, is that I'm talking about a home movie here. That's
right, a home movie.Back in the early 80s, a few friends by the name of Eric Zala, Chris
Strompolos, Jayson Lamb, and Angela Rodriguez, who were all around 11
years of age, saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. It blew Zala and
Strompolos's minds and at the age of 11 they decided to make a shot for
shot remake of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Over the next seven years,
Strompolos and Zala would enlist the help of all their friends and
their friend's friends each summer to complete their film, which was
made with money from their allowances and on their home video
camcorders. The result is nothing less than spectacular or well,
legendary.These kids spent the best summer years of their lives making a movie
that hell, has already been made, but it's their sheer passion and love
for this film and character that drove themselves and everyone else
around them to finish the movie. The result is actually a very kick-ass
kid made film that captures each camera angle and expression just like
it was made in the original film by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.
over the years, some of these friends lost touch, but the movie was
still stored away on VHS, until a few people got a hold of it and began
showing it to other people.Those people then got it into the hands of a few filmmakers who are
well known, which led to this homemade 'Raiders' movie being shown at a
film festival, to which the crowd went crazy over. Everyone loved it,
because it was pure magic. It reminds those of us who use to take our
dad's over the shoulder camcorder and make our own movies with friends.
Back to a time when nothing else mattered but making a fun adventure
film with your best friends.Let's fast forward to present day where filmmakers Jeremy Coon and Tim
Skousen ('Thunder Broke the Heavens') found out about this documentary
and thought there would be a good story to tell here in the form of a
documentary. Well, they did just that. Coon and Skousen tracked down
Eric Zala, Chris Strompolos, Jayson Lamb, Angela Rodriguez and their
families and asked them to tell just how they accomplished this amazing
achievement in movie-making. Come to find out, this homemade film was
not yet finished.It was still lacking one scene, which was the iconic fight scene on top
of the Nazi airplane with Indiana Jones and that huge giant of a beast
guy. So, 'Raiders!: The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made' tells
the story of the ups and downs of the making of this homemade movie
along with the entire cast and crew reuniting to make the last scene
with a decent sized budget. This documentary has tons of archival
footage of these kids making this movie during their youthful summers
as well as interviews from each cast member and their families.For those of you who have ever tried to make something, whether it be a
movie, a song, or a piece of art, will completely become infatuated and
fall in love with these people's stories and passion for making a movie
and for their undying love for 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. You'll laugh
throughout, shed a tear or two, and jump out of your seat at a couple
of truly shocking moments. This documentary is one of the reasons I
truly love movies and making them.",106,2015

be an adaptation of one of his story. Expected some kind of drama,
adventure, emotions, twists. But instead got a really boring
experience. Had to fast forward a lot of areas as many portions were
easily predictable. Maybe it had many layers of intricate details but
to a casual viewer like me it was all the more uninteresting.
Screenplay of contrasting the colors used for Sr and Jr was good.Final word : It's not a movie of entertainment. Maybe a movie of
artistic value. After watching the whole movie, I liked only one
person. And it was Guy Burnet.",90,2012
517,9.5,7.3,"Well, what is this movie about? To begin with: although the vampire was
best popularized in the modern era by English writers, it is really a
myth of Eastern European Roman Catholicism. (I could explain that
better - and why the English so well co-opted it - but obviously not
here.) This type of Catholicism (which finally produced a Pope in John
Paul II) now only thrives (and none too well) in Poland - Polanski's
home country. During the Second World War, Poland was utterly
decimated. First, a large portion of its wealthiest citizens, who
happened to be Jewish, were exterminated. The Polish catholics
themselves were split radically between anti-semitic nationalists (who
also, mistakenly, thought the Nazis would save them from the Russians)
and pro-Communists who, mistakenly, thought the Russians would save
them from the Nazis. Obviously, this was a no-win situation for the
Poles. And yet the first cinematic impression of this disaster arrived
in the form of - a comedy - Ernst Lubitsch's ""To Be Or Not To Be""
(later remade by Mel Brooks).Does the reader really need to know all this to appreciate this movie?
actually, yes. This film is laughter at death's door. The funniest and
most memorable line in the film is from the Jewish vampire, responding
to a threatened crucifix: ""Oy vey, have you got the wrong vampire!""
Funny? - Hilarious. Unfortunately, if this Vampire had any
grandchildren, they all died in Auschwitz.Why am I playing such a heavy hand here? Because this really is a great
horror-comedy, far better and far more important than the studio hacks
at MGM who released this film (after chopping it up) could ever have
understood.There is unfortunately no rumor that there's a director's cut in the
vaults; it is well to remember that Polanski nearly disowned this film
on release, and really only reclaimed it after the brutal slaying of
his wife, who plays such an important role in the film.But even as shredded as it is (pay especially close attention to the
discontinuities involving the Professor), this is still marvelously
written, directed, and photographed - truly frightening at moments,
utterly hilarious at others, but always grounded in a particularly
Polish sensibility which is now, alas, a thing of the past; - the
preservation of a culture that, at its best, was among the best in
Europe.",108,1967

appeared as everything from a masked Cossack to an Italian Renaissance
explorer, a foreign legionnaire, a baseball great and countless
sophisticated romantic adventurers, he is best remembered as a Western
star...'Garden of Evil' tells the story of three American adventurers (Cooper,
Widmark, and Mitchell) who are stranded in a Mexican fishing village
after the ship that was taking them to California is put out of
commission... All three were headed for the Californian gold rush... Instead, they
are now in Puerto Miguel, approached by a woman in trouble, a
Spanish-speaking American woman, Leah Fuller (Susan Hayward), who
offers to pay them handsomely if they escort her through hazardous
Indian territory to rescue her husband who is hurt and trapped in a
gold mine up there in the hills...The mention of gold makes them agree and, together with a Mexican macho
man named Vicente (Victor Manuel Mendoza), begin their long, arduous
journey...Emotions become tense when Leah discovers Vicente marking trails and,
later, finds herself fighting off the crude advances of one of the
three soldiers of fortune...When the group arrives at what the Indians call the Garden of Evil, a
sacred grounds atop a high mountain where the mine is located, they
found Fuller (Hugh Marlowe) still alive, but embittered and with a
broken leg... The group's troubles grow when they discover they are in danger,
practically harassed by savage Indians... ""Garden of Evil"" was Cooper first motion picture in CinemaScope...
Along the way, he proves himself a powerful leader with a commanding
performance...Susan Hayward kept her thoughts and her affections pretty much of a
secret, remaining skeptical about her motives... This was her second
movie with Gary Cooper since her appearance in William A. Wellman's
superb, high adventure 'Beau Geste,' and her third with director
Hathaway...Richard Widmark proceeds his ways of gambling with a neat line in
cynical cracks; Cameron Mitchell fails in his unwelcome sexual
advances; Hugh Marlowe uses a variety of both conscious and unconscious
processes to deal with his angry feelings; Victor Manuel Mendoza gets
intensely angry after being hit; and Rita Moreno delights the
environment with her sweet voice...Hathaway was one of the great Hollywood veterans still in harness, a
versatile director whose Westerns have been as variable in quality as
his other films... Filmed on location in Mexico, his 'Garden of Evil'
is a beautiful spectacle to behold... The vistas are strikingly clear
and vivid... The film is a well-done character piece, concentrating on
the relationships of the characters as on the evil influence of gold...",100,1954

films. Everyone needs to grow, it's just that I think Woody has grown in the
wrong direction. In the films that followed ""Annie Hall"" he seemed to be
trying to be Bergman at times and Fellini at others, when I always thought
he was better just being Woody. Why? Because he was funny, and this film
is the funniest of them all.This is Woody at his zaniest, his most anarchic, his most irreverent, his
wildest. It is zany in the same sense that the Marx Brothers were at their
height. He isn't afraid to have segments that are just plain crazy and
unbelievable. I wonder if David Reuben realized that Woody was actually
mocking his book when he sold the rights. A classic.

520,11.8,7.3,"THE CRYING GAME / (1992) ***1/2 (out of four)
By Blake French: I admire Neil Jordan for contributing his vastly original ideas to theater
screens, as do I admire the Academy Awards, who appropriately rewarded ""The
Crying Game"" with the best original screenplay Oscar in 1992. The film also
earned nominations for best picture, director, leading and supporting
actors, and editing. Jordan's style of filmmaking feels consistent over the
years. ""The Crying Game"" offers the usual flavor of Jordan, but also
incorporates unexpected, ninety degree twists that change the pace of his
story altogether. ""The Crying Game"" begins in Northern Ireland, where the IRA takes prisoner
a British soldier named Jody (Forest Whitaker). Among the team of committed
terrorists is the quiet Fergus (Stephen Rea), and the seductive Jude
(Miranda Richardson), who guard Jody in an isolated forest shelter. As
Fergus continually watches Jody, the two become begin to like one another.
Jody knows that his tragic fate nears, therefore, shows Fergus a photograph
of his romantic interest, who lives back in London. He asks Fergus to look
her up sometime if he ever gets the chance.  The movie takes a ridged, unexpected turn, and the next time we see Fergus,
he is living as a construction worker in London under a new name. He finds
the soldier's girlfriend working at a beauty salon. Her name is Dil (Jaye
Davidson). Fergus gets a haircut, and follows her to a nearby bar, then the
next thing we know the two are deeply in love. But Dil has a secret-and so
does Fergus. What would Dil think if she knew her new lover was responsible
for her late boyfriend's death?  Stephen Rae is the best thing in the movie, interlocking the several
separate plots with a concrete narrative. The film takes his point of view,
and does so consistently. This is essential, since we learn information as
he does-a classic yet extraordinarily effective method of keeping an
audience involved. Here, Jordan celebrates a clean story, but reveals
information about certain characters that change the entire direction of the
story, while keeping the important material in play. That is not easy. ""The Crying Game"" is not for everyone-it's a hard, perverse movie with
enough content to warrant several R ratings. The sexual content is
unexpected and distorted, but stunningly original. Three minutes do not pass
before a character casually utters the notorious four-letter word. Even the
violence is aggressive and graphic. ""The Crying Game"" takes no prisoners, so
hold on tight and come prepared for the ride.  I think the film could have investigated the relationship between Dil and
Jody with more detail. We learn how Jody feels about Dil, but Dil resists
sharing her feelings about Jody. Is this done for a purpose? I think so.
Neil Jordan is not the kind of director who would leave out massive plot
nuggets like this, especially in a movie as deliberate and complex as ""The
Crying Game."" However, Dil feels a little shallow in this area. With a
little more emotion and dimension, she could have been even more intriguing.
Jaye Davidson does a great job with the character, however, which probably
explains why this element of the story has not received many other
complaints. ""The Crying Game"" was certainly one of the most original movies to hit
theaters in 1992, and deserved many of its award nominations and wins. Neil
Jordan bravely takes us through controversial material, while at the same
time, keeps us focused on the main points of the movie. He keeps the
audience in his grasp the whole way through-something all directors should
strive to accomplish.",112,1992
521,4.0,7.3,"Powerful, intelligent documentary around the huge effort to head off
the start of the Iraq war, and the lingering echoes coming down from
the protest marches of tens of millions in hundreds of cities of around
the world on Feb. 15, 2003, the largest world-wide protest ever. While the first half of the film shows how that wonderful show of
massive human unity failed in the short term to stop that terrible war
based on false evidence  a truth which is a terribly sad to re-visit -
the 2nd half of the documentary combines anger and optimism in equal
parts to show that those efforts made were not in vain in the larger
picture. From showing how the protests in Egypt against the Iraq war laid the
groundwork for the successful uprising against the Mubarek government
10 years later, to the recent turn where the UK Parliament refused to
give support for U.K. military intervention in Syria - members of the
government openly afraid of repeating the errors of 2003. As the film points out, the fact that tens of millions of people were
right that the war was unnecessary, the fact that Tony Blair is now
seen as having been part of one of the biggest military disasters of
the last 100 years has made members of government scared of repeating
that debacle (hence also Obama's reticence re Syria). But if those
millions hadn't raised their voices back then, if no one had seemed to
care, then the fear and 2nd guessing that governments are showing now
might not have happened, and further needless military adventures may
have ensued. At a moment when it feels like peaceful protest and citizen empowerment
movements are all but pointless and impotent, the film is a welcome
balm pointing out that the reality is more complex, and giving up in
despair is neither wise nor called for. The fascinating and moving interviews and commentators include John le
Carre'. Stephen Hawking, Tom Hayden, Noam Chomsky, Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, Jesse Jackson, Ken Loach, and most amazingly Colin Powell's Chief
of Staff from the Bush years Lawrence Wilkerson, who says he would like
to see Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld tried for war crimes - even if it
meant he'd be put away too  and would gladly testify against them. An

'80s, it's suspenseful, and it gives us a really gritty inside look at
what life is like for a good guy who goes undercover to work with the
Colombian drug cartel.Which is what Bryan Cranston's character does. He's a guy on the verge
of retirement and could easily leave to spend time with his wife and
kids, but takes this one last job. And it proves to be the toughest one
yet as he poses as a money launderer to try and take down Pablo
Escobar's entire drug trafficking network.It takes place in the Reagan-'80s and so there's this whole overt
camera filter over the whole film. It's not too distracting, but it's
also not terribly necessary. But it's minor.The whole thing plays out as one giant sting operation. And the
filmmakers understand that in a 2 hour movie, you don't need to run
through all the details in one quick dialogue-filled scene. However, it
would've been nice if they had given us a little more along the way.It starts unraveling a little over an hour in. There's about a 30
minute stretch where you're looking at the person sitting next to you
saying, ""What's happening?"" There's a lot left unexplained, but I guess
there was more concern about the movie not becoming any longer.The film is long at 127 minutes, but it's never really an issue. We
need the time to process what's happening and for Cranston's character
to evolve over the course of the film.It tightens back up in the home stretch, culminating in an emotionally
impressive final scene.The always-under-appreciated John Leguizamo plays Cranston's partner
and does a very good and believable job.There seems to be this slightly neglected theme intermittently placed
throughout the film about the American economy collapsing without
laundered money. It's an interesting idea and one that should have been

sequel ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"". Why? Well, because just what
more could there be to tell about this story?With that being said, then don't get me wrong. ""Alice: Through the
Looking Glass"" is not a bad movie, it just seems like a movie that
hardly was necessary to have been made. It is a good movie in itself,
and works quite well as a stand-alone, if you will.The effects in ""Alice: Through the Looking Glass"" were great, as they
also were in the previous movie. And it was nice to see the beloved
characters from the first movie return, and also to see the amazing job
that the special effects team pulled off at bringing the world to life.
Lots of details, vivid colors and memorable characters.The actors and actresses in the movie were doing good jobs with their
given roles, and it was a great treat to have the original cast return
to play their characters once again. The Time character was
interesting, but it left a less than savory taste in my mouth that they
had cast Sacha Baron Cohen for this role. He is not an actor that I am
too fond of, so in my opinion another cast would have been preferable.
I do enjoy the Mad Hatter character and Johnny Depp does a great job in
portraying him. And it was nice to get to see more of that quirky
character and get to know more of his background.The special effects and wardrobe teams really are the ones shining in
this movie, because there are just so many wonderful things to look at

Cronenberg, one should probably at least try and come up with an
original idea or study the thematic content of that particular director

told to find dates for their upcoming sister's wedding in Hawaii. As a
joke, they throw an ad up on Craigslist, their description for the
essential date looking something like this:  An excuse to get dressed up  Open bar & food all night 
Eccentric/downright dangerous bro-2-bro dance moves (may need to sign a

consider him for a supporting role.Next thing they know, they get over 6,000 responses from girls who find
them attractive, leading to appearances in talk shows and a series of
mock-dates. Fox Studios even made the last part of their ad come true.
The unfortunate result is a wild and mean-spirited ""comedy"" that exists
for all the wrong reasons.The two leading males, Mike and Dave, are played by the overly handsome
Adam Devine (Mike) and Zac Efron (Dave). Their dates are played by the
even more overly attractive Aubrey Plaza (Mike's date) and Anna
Kendrick (Dave's date). None of these four young stars are as funny as
you'd think they are, and they each resort only to screaming like drunk
bozos to spice up the sleazy screenplay. They're all unbearably
annoying to watch, Anna Kendrick in particular. The supporting cast was
equally as horrible, say for instance Sugar Lyn Beard, who plays the
soon-to-be-married sister of Mike and Dave. She's not exactly a ""bad
actress,"" she just has this annoying high-pitched voice that doesn't
even sound that natural.But that's not even the worst of it. No, the worst is yet to come.There is no story, but rather a series of jokes that drag on and on and
on without a clear punchline. Within the hour and thirty-eight minutes
you'll need to suffer through, a girl falls off a roof and gets
seriously hurt, a building catches fire at a 4th of July party, a
grandfather dies at his birthday celebration, a girl gets hit in the
face by an all-terrain vehicle and is heavily bruised the day before
her wedding rehearsal, and all of these bits are intended to be the
most hilarious thing ever. But did I laugh? Well no, but the audience
in my screening were hysterical throughout the entire movie, which
makes me incredibly worried.Emotional moments of redemption are attempted by the third act, but
none of them are earned nor appropriate. The crazy events and dirty
jokes all try to meet up in some sort of message about how life is not
about getting the big things. Yeah, right. Just the number of ""should I
really be laughing at this"" type of jokes glamorizes the romantic
lifestyle rather than attacks it. So therefore, the redemption that
this movie tries to get to is complete bull. In the end, Mike and Dave

was not made to be loved by everyone, only people with prior knowledge
of KSI's humour. By merely reading the plot summary, anyone could
conclude this film was never going to be highlight of anyone's week. Casper Lee's performance was arguably ""cringe-worthy"" at best.
Furthermore, whilst the plot was never exactly inspired in the first
place, the film is so unrealistic in some areas, it draws into question
the credibility of it even being a comedy- It's NOT funny. In summary, it's a short and easy film to watch purely to see KSI's

540,15.0,6.0,"So I'll start off by saying that I actually liked the original Purge, I
know many people were expecting it to be a bit bigger and to expand
more on the premise but I still enjoyed it and thought it was a pretty
fun Horror/Thriller. Then the second Purge (which really wasn't a
sequel, more of just a separate movie set in the same universe apart
from one little tie in) came out and I enjoyed that one as well,
however I thought it was a bit more cheesy than the original and it was
really more of an Action/Thriller than a horror movie. I was pretty set
with those two, I didn't think there was any need to continue on with
the franchise, but we rarely ever get big release horror movies anymore
so I decided to just suck it up and give The Purge: Election Year a
chance.So the premise was actually pretty interesting, a Senator whose family
was slaughtered in front of her on Purge night is running for president
in an effort to stop the Purge. However from there things start to get
really really stupid. Since her opposition wants to keep her out of
office they decide to disband the law that protects political officials
on Purge night, thus making her fair game. When this news is shared
with the Senator she decides that instead of locking herself up in a
safe house (which would keep her and her dream to stop the purge alive)
she'll just put the life of herself and the lives of her security team
in jeopardy by just hanging out at her house on Purge night. This is
one of many stupid decisions made by the Senator, and that is one of
the main reasons why I found it very hard to root for her. Luckily she
has a bad ass security guard (the main character from the second film)
who is there to rescue her when things go south on Purge night, from
there the film basically just becomes a rinse and repeat of the second
film. There is also a sub plot about a extremely cookie cutter deli
owner who will do anything in his power to protect his deli.I think my main issue with the film is that the characters were just so
cheesy and unrealistic. All the good guys who we are suppose to care
for just ooze cheese and almost every line that comes out of their
mouths is cringe worthy. The is one character in particular (the deli
owner) who I found myself rooting against because he was just such a
lame and unbelievable character, they actually tried to give this guy
catch phrases. These felt like characters out of a bad action movie,
and that's really what this film was at it's core, a lousy action movie
in a horror setting. The villains weren't much better, at one point
they try to pass off a group of obnoxious teenage girl as villains, the
scenes with these girls were drawn out and extremely irritating, these
characters belonged in a teen comedy not a R rated ""Horror"" film.All in all I thought this was a lousy sequel and that the Purge
Franchise would have been better after just being two films. They
basically just repackaged The Purge: Anarchy with worse characters and
a little bit more of an expansion on the story. The worst part is they
will probably make more of these, they will run this franchise into the
dirt just like the Paranormal Activity franchise. My expectations were
not very high, yet I was still pretty disappointed.",109,2016

battle groups of soldiers, electric fences, military mines, or etc. No
thermal-cameras or night vision.The story - a lot of ideas, but without a full realization. I can't
understand what's going on, because there is no information about the
fractions (I've zero idea about the story in the FF games and I don't
know if there is some connection between them and the movie).The people on the street are low-rendered, the main heroes - fully

rest of the film was interesting to me. It was rather on good pace. Not
slow or too rushed. The acting was believable. The setting is good. The
story is interesting and has some minor twists which are good. It keeps
you guessing. I can not say that anything was predictable as many

very little awesome.There are clear comparisons to Jurassic World, but where that movie's
shaky plot is made up for by big budget effects, cool set pieces and
Chris Pratt, this movie has none of these, so it is just mostly
rubbish.Sure there are some laughs at seeing actors pretend they are sitting on
elephants and hanging from a rope (seriously how hard is it to actually
shoot actors hanging from a rope - just put them on a rope a couple of

547,9.0,5.2,"After the big hoo-ha about how bad this film is, in particular because
of Zoe Saldana's casting, I decided to give this movie a shot.I know virtually nothing about Nina Simone's life, but this film does
not want to portray what her life was during her prime. Instead it
relies on itty bitty pieces of dialogue during interviews and
conversations with Nina's old friend Richard Pryor. It is set during
the last decade of her life, when she is mentally ill, unstably
alcoholic and very difficult to tolerate. Clifton (David Oyelowo), the
nurse at the mental hospital where she is interred, takes her in, looks
after her and eventually becomes her manager. The real problem with this movie is, glaringly, the time period of
Nina's life. It's not a good one, and very little happens in the movie.
We start her off as a little girl defying racial segregation so that
her parents can sit in the front row. Nothing else is shown of her rise
to fame and struggles, which makes the film feel very empty. One thing I really didn't like is the erasure of Clifton's
homosexuality. Although he and Nina are not seen intimate with each
other (at one point she calls him the F word when he refuses to have
sex with her) there is a small implication. Why couldn't they show
everyone he was gay?The last thing is of course Zoe Saldana as Nina. I personally feel the
criticism (and it was extremely scornful) was very unfair. She did the
best with what she was given, and she should be praised for it. The
problem is not the color of her skin, its the age. She is supposed to
be in her sixties, and yet Saldana is actually younger than David
Oyelowo! They really couldn't find an older actress?At times the movie was painfully boring, badly paced and perhaps
unintentionally funny. 5 out 10.",90,2016

It's all very literary and symbolic (the exotic creatures of the pet shop

exotic dancers of the club where he finds his solace after hours) and
surprisingly emotional (especially at the end). Character development,
secrets, and inner truths are revealed slowly and carefully and in

552,13.0,6.2,"It seems that, after the massive success of Drive, Refn is being given
the opportunity to make the films he wants to make and take a lot of
creative license.I think this is a good thing, and it's a smart way to go about a career
in any creative industry. Achieve mainstream success doing things that
are commercially viable, and when you have people's attention and
trust, you can do something more abstract and creative and people will
actually go see it with an open mind, and quite possibly love it. Another example of this is a band like Radiohead, they put out ""Creep""
which is a perfect radio single, and when that got them famous, they
went and made albums that would never have been produced or listened to
if they had done them straight away. This is a cool movie. It's not for everyone. The editing, camera work,
framing, pace, screenplay, lighting, production design, wardrobe... all
the creative elements of this film have a modern, stylistic feel that
seems ahead of it's time. It's the type of movie you may want to tell
all your friends is your ""favorite"" even if it's not, just to make
yourself look cool (haha.. sad but true)The plot is very abstract, and contains a lot of elements of
surrealism. Refn reminds me of film-makers like David Lynch or Terry
Gilliam or even Salvador Dali. I like that he took a risk and really
went with his vision to make a film that could never have mainstream
appeal. It is a piece of art, and left open to interpretation. The
whole thing may be a dream, or an alternate reality, or some
combination of these with real life. The production design and framing and editing made me feel things and
think things and imagine things. It seemed to be trying to take me on a
journey through space and time while telling an intoxicating story that
was an allusion to the real world. It helps to be in the right state both mentally and physically for a
movie like this. It's the type of movie you want to watch in a very
dark room, on a very comfortable couch, with a big screen and a great
surround sound system. Then you can prepare to get lost in the film and
experience it as a whole, instead of just watching it.I definitely can't watch movies like this everyday, and while it is a
great exercise in expanding your mind, being creative, and thinking
abstract thoughts, it may seem boring on the wrong day. A cool thing about movies like this, is the re-watch-ability of them.
Most movies are best the first time you see them, and don't offer much
for a repeated viewing. This is the type of movie that can be watched
many times. The experience will be different each time and you may
notice or realize things you didn't see the first time. It reminds me of David Lynch and his movie ""Mulholland Drive."" I really
love that movie and it is similar in the way that people love it or
hate it. With ""Mulholland Drive,"" I watched it many times, and grew to
understand it on my own terms, which was a fun journey.I do hope that Reft doesn't decide to continue making movies that are
always this abstract. Often times, I watch movies with a great plot,
that are very entertaining films, but wish the director and
cinematographer had been more creative with the lighting and camera
work. Seeing his style and eye applied to mainstream blockbusters and
thrillers would be really cool in my opinion, but I doubt he will ever
go too far into directing movies with a typical ""Hollywood"" script.
After the success of ""Mulholland Drive,"" Lynch continued to make
exclusively dreamy, abstract movies, and while I respected that, it
just didn't seem necessary.Go check this movie out with an open mind on a night when you are
relaxed and feeling good. Maybe watch it with some friends and have a
good conversation afterward sharing thoughts and interpretations; I'm
sure they will vary radically. You might love it, and you might hate
it, but I think most people will respect the artistry of the film and
have trouble forgetting it anytime soon.",118,2016

for any Friday or Saturday night with the friends. The main draw of the
friend is the emotional bond shared between the mother and daughter.
What starts out as bitter resentment turns into a shared fight for
survival. Another way in which the film stands out from its peers is with what I
will call it's ""snake- o-vision,"" the point of view of the snake as it
approaches its victims. Venom proves that it is another great addition

""Portrait of a Zombie"" is indeed new and innovative. However, that
doesn't necessarily make it great.The movie had potential, and if it had a bigger budget the movie would
indeed have been so much more than it was. I must say that ""Portrait of
a Zombie"" turned out to be a rather ambitious amateurish project. But
it was still enjoyable enough for what it was - and for what it turned
out to be.The storyline in ""Portrait of a Zombie"" is about a family that have a
zombie at home, their son Billy. The neighborhood is in uproar and the
family still treats him as being alive and still being their son.Story-wise, then there were aspects to the story that were alright, but
in overall, it wasn't memorable.What really needed more detail, work and better execution was the
make-up and effects of the zombies. It was basically just make-up added
to people's faces, and of course they committed the ultimate flaw here;
forgetting about the neck and ears. So the face had make-up and special
effects applied, while the neck and ears were left in proper skin
tones. It is just such a bad mistake to make.The gun effects in the movie were just atrocious, and the movie would
have fared so much better if they had opted not to have guns in the
movie at all. If you are going to do guns, at least have them done
right.And the way that Billy was moving just didn't go well with me, it
looked like a crippled duck trying to dance break-dance. It was just
awful.The acting in the movie was actually good, given what the actors and
actresses had to work with.But for a movie of this production value, I will still applaud director
Bing Bailey for managing to get this on its feet and turn it into what
it was. If you enjoy zombie movies, then ""Portrait of a Zombie"" is
definitely worth watching a single time, because of its unique approach

e-queue but also was a little puzzled, as when I showed the movie off

websites where you can watch this movie for free on-line.However the kids really did enjoy it and as soon as the movie finished
they pressed play and watched it again, which they have not done since
Tinkerbell a good sign of money well spent. The scenes were bright and
colourful, the story engaging, a little more thrills and fun. The dopey
mermaid was funny and the grandmother was kinda cool as well.For a movie advertised as a musical, regretfully, the songs were weak.
The kids hummed away on the old Barbie tunes, but not so here. Although she does play the part of the reluctant hero, which is good,
no explanation is given why she is so reluctant. What happened to the
brave and inspiring Barbie of old who fought against all kinds of
monsters, wizards, witches etc. ""Fighting an evil princess, I don't
think I can do that."" She plays a cowardly role and wanders around far
too much. Barbie was uninspiring. There was such little characterisation built up, the entire cast seemed
one dimensional and we could not make ourselves care about any of them.
No matter how much trouble they got into we were so distant from the
movie we could not have cared less. This was the movies biggest flaw
zero empathy.When the characters had their magic drained they should have fallen
deathly ill, grey skin, feverish, then there could have been a sense of
urgency to the plot, that these friends had to push their fears aside,
band together and rescue their fellows, quickly, but there was no clock
ticking away in the background to add anything so was the usual slow
paced offering. We watched Malucia steal powers, attack people, and we were all very
disappointed when she was given such a trivial punishment at the end,

brief jump scares occasionally turn into unintentional comedy with
stiff acting and awkward scenes as though these events are pranks gone
wrong instead of genuine haunting.To its credit, the setup for the premise is decent. It's a more unique
twist of the usual possession plot. There's a good use of family bond
here, the two leads can at least produce on-screen platonic
relationships. It's definitely aimed towards the younger audience who
can relate more. However, the acting isn't superb all around, thus more
character it tries to introduce the more they become like strangers
bumping into each other.Any attempt at horror quickly fades. The sudden pop up of random lady
or the child staring bizarrely only makes it uncomfortably odd, far
from creepy. Later on it relies on cheesy CG and unconvincing practical
effects that utter hamper the tension. Drama between the characters is
inconsistent, the development sometimes happens too sudden or just

long as you have a story. Yes you can be good with the technical parts
of the film, but what good is that if there is no story to back it up?
No good, which is exactly what this film is, a real piece of bull****!I admit that Lou Doillon was not bad in the movie because honestly I am
used to seeing her in bad films anyway. Virginie Ledoyen deserves
better, the poor thing, why in the world is she stuck working with this
lousy good-for-nothing director? She should return to Jacquot and
Assayas, who are two intelligent French directors who KNOW how to make
GOOD movies with REAL stories.This impostor Pascal Laugier is just a former security guard who was an
assistant to director and producer Christophe Gans (Le Pacte de loups)
and did him favors which is how he got this job in the first place. He
is a pseudo-director and even a worse writer. A 2 year old kid would
have done a better job writing the script of this movie, which honestly
does not exist because the plot makes no sense. Even Laugier himself
admits to not knowing what is the ending, and I am not surprised at all
because he is incompetent! I am very sad for the state of French cinema if our new directors
include talentless, brain-dead copycats like Laugier. If you are going
to reference other films and even brag about it, at least try to do a
good job copying them, please. Do not be a pretentious movie geek and
try to make a movie that is not even there at the script level! This Laugier even insulted other French film makers and comedy actors
like Eric & Ramzy, when he should really look in the mirror first if he
wants to see a bad film maker. Because at least the movies of Eric &
Ramzy have a plot, are entertaining and make a lot of money! Saint-Ange
has none of the above! It is boring, stupid and a big box-office flop!The producers are also to blame for allowing this movie to get made.
They probably think that because horror movies are en vogue right now
that they can do a piece of crap and make enough money. Wrong!!!! Yes
indeed you made a piece of crap but you did not make as much money as
the American movies! This is what happens when you are motivated by
pure greed and no sense of artistry or respect for the cinema. Next
time, save some money and let your grandmother direct the movie,
because she would probably do a better job than the idiot you hired for
Saint-Ange.But there is still hope for French cinema. I have not yet seen the
films of Alexandre Aja but all my friends tell me that he is one
million times better than this Laugier, and so is another French
director Florent Emilio Siri who is talented and rising.I am not surprised that this movie has not yet been released anywhere
else outside Europe. What for? It is simply no good ! So what will
happen is that all the countries that bought the rights will just let
it go direct-to-video or to cable to break even on their costs.I would advise you not even to spend one euro (or dollar) to rent this

565,9.5,5.6,"Review: What a boring, uninteresting movie! The movie seemed cheap and
the storyline was awful. With a title like, Guns For Hire, I was
expecting some form of action, especially as Jeffrey Dean Morgan is
holding a gun on the cover but there's no action at all. Its about a
suicidal blonde, Athena (Ever Carradine), who hires a tow truck
driver/assassin, Beatle (Michele Hicks) to kill her. As Athena has no
money, she signs over an insurance policy to Beatle, which will pay for
the assassination. While there waiting for the paperwork to come
through, Athena moves in with Beatle and they start to become close,
even though the situation is slightly warped. Beatle regularly sees a
psychiatrist, Dr. Vanderark (Orlando Jones), who thinks that her whole
assassin story is in her mind and she has a strange relationship with a
hooker/stripper, Carla (Sarah Shahi), who actually has feelings for
her. They also have a brutal hit-man on there tail, Bruce (Jeffrey Dean
Morgan), who is hired by Athena's crooked previous employer, Kyle (Ben
Mendelsohn). On top of that, Detective Holt, Raffaello Degruttola is
following Athena and Beatles every move and he builds a case to try and
stop Beatle in her tracks. Sounds exciting but it really wasn't. Most
of the footage is about Athena and Beatles relationship, which is quite
boring but the major twist at the end was surprising. I personally did
lose interest after a while and the acting was quite bad from the two
leading characters. I was expecting more from Jeffrey Dean Morgan and
Ben Mendelsohn, who usually put in decent performances but the awful
script didn't bring the best out of them. I couldn't really see the
comedy side of the movie because there wasn't any wit in the script at
all but I did stick with the plot because I really couldn't see were
the film was going. When all was revealed I still wasn't that impressed
so it has to get the thumbs down from me. Disappointing! Round-Up: This is the first and only movie directed and written by
Donna Robinson, who really didn't do a good job with this film. There's
a few unnecessary lesbian scenes and there wasn't much depth to any of
the characters, which made if feel like this movie was made without
much thought. There were some good actors on board, who really got
wasted because of the awful storyline, so it has to go down as a bad

567,12.5,4.8,"Well Alleycats(2016) is a thriller, suspension, Mystery, Action Comedy
film taking place in Modern day London. Almost like the Premium
Rush(2012) with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The Story takes place when the
main Character Danni(Eleanor Tomlinson) returns back to her home roots
with her brother and bike gang, following the unfortunate events of a
blackmail gone horribly after the witness of a murder. Supported with
GoPro Fast paced footage on bike chase's and a story that not all is as
it seems, with a Twist. As Main Character Danni(Eleanor Tomlinson) its
up to her to find out what is really going on. Alleycats keeps you
Unexpectedly watching till the end. So if you want to watch a good

found"" Fatty Arbuckle-Buster Keaton comedy. The first reel is
particularly hilarious, with Fatty cooking and juggling his utensils,
""flipping a flap"" onto waiter Buster's plate. A less inhibited Buster
also provides a spontaneous, exotic dance. And, as usual,
Arbuckle's nephew, Al St. John, heartily contributes to the anarchy. One get the sense that these three men (along with Luke the dog)
had the time of their lives designing such memorable slapstick! This treat ranks alongside ""The Garage"" has one of the best

571,8.0,6.8,"A Cincinnati community center sees a sudden epidemic of incidents in
which teenage girls start fainting and convulsing in Anna Rose Holmer's
""The Fits,"" yet ""science fiction"" or ""supernatural"" are two words that
belong nowhere near this film. Instead, Holmer uses this conceit as a
tool in her 72-minute portrait of a tween girl finding her way socially
and emotionally.So little of ""The Fits"" counts toward plot or action that you might
wonder why Holmer ""dragged out"" what feels more obviously like short
film material into a feature. Yet her patience and artistry pay
dividends, at least for the open-minded viewer. The camera pierces a
further layer of its subject's 11-year-old Toni  psychology, allowing
the viewer to enter deeper into her point of view.Newcomer Royalty Hightower would obviously be a candidate to get credit
for achieving such a high degree of empathy, but in actuality, it's
Holmer's exceptional focus on Hightower. Her conscientious effort to
tell the subtext of Toni's story more than anything else results in a
film that speaks rather poetically to adolescence and self-discovery.Toni is a determined girl who understands the importance of working
hard more than most. She goes with her brother to the community center
each day to train and learn how to box, but she's transfixed by the
girls upstairs in the Lioness dance troupe. We immediately see both the
committed, tireless side of Toni and the side of her that longs to be a
dancer, and so it's clear that she can dance if that's what she desires
most.The premise of a girl boxer wanting to be a dancer is a refreshing
subversion of gender role archetypes, and a gentle way for Holmer and
co-writers Saela Davis and Lisa Kjeruiff to let viewers know that
gender identity/roles are not a focal point of their story. This is a
film about a girl finding herself, period.We get all these long, lingering, quiet moments alone with Toni in
order to really experience how she deals with the emotional storm of
her own desires, social pressure and the fear and panic induced by this
outbreak of ""fits."" And there's nothing particular unique in how she
copes, which is what makes accessing her consciousness, as the viewer,
so effortless. The power of this particular film comes from that
experience.All that said, it's hard not to wish that there had been just a few
more external factors to add tension and drama to this story,
especially with a premise that could've so easily gone that route.
Kudos to Holmer committing to her cinematic portrait and not caving to
more typical movie conventions, but something to hook the viewer a
little more would have elevated her impressive artistry.The average moviegoer won't likely stumble upon ""The Fits,"" so there's
not a whole lot of danger in it being misunderstood and dismissed for
leaning more heavily toward poetry than entertainment, but perhaps that
""supernatural"" premise warrants a bit of a disclaimer. Go in looking to
experience what it's like to be 11 again, however, and you'll be
floored by what Holmer has accomplished.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",72,2015

wonderful, creative, hilarious 1970 classic comedy directed by Carl Reiner

artistic freedom to political correctness, commercial timidity and lack of
creative talent. But don't take my word for it, ask Mel Brooks who has
remarked that some of his movies could not be made today either. Fortunately
we can get the video. The movie does require a somewhat offbeat taste to
appreciate. Everything and everyone is in a kind of reality warp, the
Hocheiser family, the Central Park muggers, the police, the nurse Louise
(Patricia Van Devere). The movie is also comment on life in America in 1970,

very well. One reviewer remarked that the movie did not credit the true

credit is given to the huntsman who actually did find the entrance in
1858. I enjoyed the production thoroughly. this is the perfect movie for
those who enjoy historical drama. Well paced with great photography and
great location sets. I have family in the film industry living in
Hollywood and it is often a great battle between the corporate
financiers who want as much sex and nudity with blond bimbos to boost
sales and are constantly ruining potentially good cinema by inserting
complete dross into otherwise good scripts. Good cinema is becoming
rare. Someone has taken a punt on this movie and my bet is that it

576,11.0,2.7,"***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***While I agree with a previous reviewer that the acting in this movie
was terrible, I have to say that quite frankly, it really didn't
matter. The best acting in the world can't make a badly written script
suddenly become good. And a badly written script can make an otherwise
great actor look REALLY BAD. ***SPOILERS FOLLOW FROM HERE*** So the theme here is that the world is
badly over-populated and can't sustain the full population. Nearly
everyone on the planet is a slave, with a small handful of people
running things who are not. Let's pause right there and consider the
logic behind this for a moment. If there are SO MANY people on the
planet that losing 9 BILLION from the population doesn't even put a
dent in the population crisis, and nearly all of those alive are slaves
who hate the way they're forced to live, that's EASILY enough to start
a rebellion and overthrow the small number who are making their lives
miserable. But let's suspend our disbelief and put that logic aside for
the moment. If that many people are unable to overthrow the elite few,
then those elite few must have some REALLY SICK advanced technology,
right? OK, so if they have that kind of tech (which is clearly the case
judging by the massive flying ships near and at the end of the movie),
why the heck haven't they left the planet and colonized the Moon, Mars,
or just plain built massive space stations complete with colossal
hydroponic farms to accommodate all those people? I mean, with that
many billions of slaves, it wouldn't take long at all. And you can't
say there aren't enough mineral resources to accomplish it, since they
clearly have enough tech to mine asteroids, the moon, or other planets,
not to mention cannibalizing and recycling outdated tech for its
materials.So what's their answer to over-population instead? ***insert fake
sarcastic tone*** Let's create a game that kills off 90% of the people
who bet on it. I mean, we're insanely greedy, megalomaniacs, so if we
have too many slaves to support everyone, it's probably best to just
kill off a few billion of them rather than using that man-power to
expand our power and wealth, right? ***end sarcasm*** I really wonder if the writers ever bothered to stop and think about
the logic behind this script (or lack thereof). Combine the bad writing
with a juxtaposition against other movies with similar themes (Hunger
Games, Maze Runner series, Cube (not that I liked Cube all that much,
but even THAT had better writing and more of a point than THIS movie))
and this movie totally bombs, which is a huge understatement. This
movie is comparable to a 2-year old with a toy steering wheel on their
lap, sitting next to mom or dad in the car and believing that driving
with their toy is comparable to what the parent is doing with the real
car. The simple fact that I've even taken the time to write this review
is an OVERWHELMING testament to how bad this movie was. Seriously. I
have never written a movie review before, even though I've seen some
truly horrible movies. But this one was so bad, I actually created an
IMDb account for the first time ever for the sole purpose of writing
this review so I could let people know how horrible the movie was. It

580,9.4,6.9,"""Free State of Jones"" is a moving, authentic, important film. Matthew
McConaughey gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Newton Knight, an
historic figure. I forgot I was watching Matthew McConaughey and felt
that I was watching Newton Knight. I've really never seen a performance
quite like McConaughey's here. His Newt Knight is the most manly man in
any room  or swamp  and yet he is also as tender as a mother. In the early Civil War battle scenes, he plays a nurse. Knight is not
shown mowing down the enemy with impressive, explosive gunfire. Rather,
he is shown risking enemy fire in order to save men's lives, or to
retrieve and bury the corpse of a boy shot in battle on his first day.
My tears flowed freely during these scenes. Later, Knight himself cries
after one of his men is hanged. But Knight gets his revenge, an
eye-for-an-eye revenge scene that I won't soon forget. Newton Knight was a white Mississippi farmer. He was the grandson of a
slaveholder, but Knight owned no slaves himself. He served in the
Confederate army, but deserted in 1862, after serving for almost a
year. He was outraged by the Twenty Negro Law, that allowed families
who owned twenty slaves to exempt one family member from service for
every twenty slaves they owned. Knight and other deserters formed The Free State of Jones, declaring
their loyalty to the Union, and flying the stars and stripes rather
than the stars and bars. After the war, Knight worked for
Reconstruction and married Rachel, a freed slave woman. His children
also married cross-racially. He died in 1922. As might be expected, he
is a controversial figure in Mississippi. Fans of the Confederacy
denounce him as a traitor. Others celebrate him as one white Southerner
who had a conscience and resisted white supremacy. Newt Knight was clearly someone with a bucketload of charisma. His
power inspired men to fight to the death against their own nation.
McConaughey radiates charisma in this role. He is masterful and yet
intimate. I'd follow this Newt Knight into battle and feel proud to do
so. ""Free State of Jones"" is receiving negative reviews. It's easy to see
why. There is something in this film to anger multiple grievance
mongers. First, race hustlers will hate this movie. Race hustlers want the
official story to be that all whites are supremacists and all blacks
are heroic. A film that depicts a white man who worked for black rights
is taboo. Race hustlers anathematized ""Mississippi Burning"" and ""The
Help"" for the same reason. Such a shame that the race hustlers'
ideological blindfolds make it impossible for them to appreciate great
art. Liberals might hate this film for a couple of other reasons. I don't
know if I've seen a movie where almost every scene hinges on how guns
are used. Almost everyone is armed, and uses those weapons to keep
breathing and to settle disputes. Even little girls have guns and use
them heroically. Second amendment fans may love this film. It depicts
what they dream of: oppressed citizenry taking up arms to defeat their
own government. In addition to clinging to their guns, these rebels cling to their God
and their Bibles. This is one of the most religious American films I've
seen in a while. It's an historical fact that Newt Knight was a
devoutly religious Primitive Baptist  he didn't drink, for example.
The film drives home Knight's Christianity. He is shown in a long scene
using a quill to record a birth in his Bible. In one heartbreaking
scene, a slave who has been sexually molested survives psychologically
by reciting verses from Genesis. ""Free State of Jones"" practices a
muscular Christianity. One eye-for-an-eye scene takes place in a
church. Republicans will be torn about ""Free State of Jones."" On the one hand,
Knight, like many populist leaders, preaches against economic
inequality. ""No man should be poor just so that someone else can be
rich."" I can hear theater seats squeak as Republicans head for the
exits. Knight's words, though, reflect the facts. Poor white
Southerners were sabotaged by the slave economy and they knew it.
That's why they deserted. But Republicans, if they sit through the entire film, will see how the
Republican Party was the favored choice of freed slaves in the
post-Civil-War era. There is a narrative problem in the film. The viewer expects ""Free
State of Jones"" to end after the Civil War. I actually began tying my
sneakers, readying to leave the theater. But the film keeps going in
what feels like an anti-climax. Gary Ross, the filmmaker, wants to make
a point: the Civil War was *not* the happy ending. The KKK rose up, and
Jim Crow became entrenched. Black men who tried to exercise their right
to vote were lynched. This is an important point, but the film should
have been better structured so its narrative flow didn't stop before
the film itself did. ""Free State of Jones"" was clearly made by sticklers for authenticity.
Everyone looks dirty and tired. The clothes look like clothes people
wore in the nineteenth century. A confederate officer's uniform looks
baggy and tacky, not sparkling and admirable. Scenes are shot in
lamplight. I loved this aspect of the film, as will Civil War
re-enactors.",139,2016
581,4.0,6.3,"Recently a lot of Kevin Hart's movies have been pretty lack luster. The
Ride Along movies and Get Hard were shredded by critics. When I saw the
trailer for Central Intelligence, I thought this would be just another
one of those flicks. Thankfully, I was very wrong! The page here lists
the film as an ""action, comedy, crime"" movie but really it is more of a
""action, comedy, drama"" flick. Dwayne Johnson plays the gentle giant
Bob Stone/Robby Weirdicht (haha pun) who works for the CIA while Kevin
Hart plays the everyday joe Calvin Joyner (a nice change of pace in my
opinion). These two are the reason this film works as pure
entertainment. They have great chemistry together and they play rather
interesting characters. Robby is on the same level as Jason Bourne when
it comes to hand to hand combat and other spy stuff like that but he
has the sensitivity and the tastes of a fourteen year old girl. I don't
care who you are, you have to admit that's hilarious. Calvin was the
favorite student of his high school but now he is just a washed up
accountant upset with where his life has gone. Hart and Johnson bring
some real comedy to their roles as well as true conviction. You can
believe that these two are dealing with some real emotional problems. I
never thought of either of them as good actors but they do a splendid
job here. The stunts they pull also look so very realistic. They are
very thrilling and pretty creative too. Now the movie isn't without
problems-what movie is? The spy portion of the plot is pretty straight
forward and shallow. It's obviously just an excuse to get these two
together but is that really such a bad thing when what they are
offering is so good? Central Intelligence is kind of like that movie
Twins with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito. Two popular actors
play as comic foils to one another as well as provide great drama with
some cool stunts thrown in. What more could you want?",107,2016

playing. Therefore you can count me as a fan. Now onto the movie...
Gosh, I saw it at a pre-screening, and I kept wanting more of it. It
just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found
throughout the movie for the fans. I also incredibly enjoyed the intro
sequence.Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the
story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the
whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the lore lasts
well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way
too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? OK, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Duncan's vision
of it. All of us have our own visions of the lore and books which may
or may not be compatible with that of Duncan's, but I can safely assume
that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the
story as Chris Metzen; that's the thing with story: each player /
reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never
before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken
a walk in the town where I grew up, Stormwind, Goldshire, Ironforge,
everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of
another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on
screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and
let me tell you right away, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look
like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the story a lot. The actors were
great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I
had never seen orcs in such detail before, hulky, robust, terrifyingly
but also relative.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the next movie... In the meantime, I'll
watch this one over and over again when I can. This movie has
everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just
might bring more people to actually play WoW. Parents, maybe some
scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood
(even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably
evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage,
responsibility, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone
can help to change things. That will go down in history as being one of

unanswered questions. Some actors stands out and some are not so good.
But mostly they are doing a good job capturing the paranoia and cabin
fever'ish mood. Stupid goofs like, ""we have two weeks worth of supply
and gas for the generator"" Why not conserve it? no use generator even
during daylight. It's ""50 below outside"" yet we see a clear thawing :-D
What happened to the squid infested arm that was chopped off? No
explanation or examinations of that arm, why? And Why was the cat
sacrificed? By whom? And finally, what was the deer ""thing""?! A god? An
alien? A manifestation of cabin fever ? I watched this on Bluray, and it really gives the beautiful cold

595,4.75,0.0,"""Birdman of Alcatraz"" depicts a fictionalized version of the life of
Robert Stroud, a real prisoner who served a life sentence in various
American prisons, including Alcatraz.As other viewers have commented, the film fictionalizes the life of the
real Robert Stroud, who was a murderer and who has been accused of
being a pedophile, as well.This fictionalization should not interfere with an intelligent viewer's
enjoyment of a fine film.Too, this fictionalization doesn't change the key features of Stroud's
case -- a bad man, a man who is shown on screen to be a real murderer,
was condemned to death by the state. That much is true from Stroud's
real life story, and that much is shown in the film.Stroud was a difficult person who did not treat other people decently.
That much was true of the real Stroud and that is shown in the film.Stroud's mother pled for his life and President Woodrow Wilson commuted
his sentence to life. A warden, aware of how difficult Stroud was to
control, declared that Stroud be kept in segregation. That much is true
in Stroud's real life story, and that is depicted in the film.Finally, Stroud became noteworthy for his research and writing on
canaries, after he found an injured bird in the recreation yard. That
much was true in Stroud's life, and that is shown in the film.Those who argue that the film is not as accurate as it could be have a
point, but the film does follow the facts outlined above.The film is quiet, and black and white, and yet riveting.It is an example of a kind of film-making that is sadly lost today. The
film attempts a serious discussion of serious issues: the value of a
man, the death penalty, the role of prisons, their wardens and guards,
the possibility of human connection, even under conditions of relative
isolation. Stroud makes some human contact with his guard, and with a
fellow inmate he communicates with via tapping.The film is riveting because its entire cast has a kind of star power
that is hard to find today. Even given his quiet, surly performance in
this black and white film, you can't take your eyes off of Burt
Lancaster. The supporting cast is equally excellent.This film is a must for anyone interested in cinematic treatments of
prisons, of the death penalty, of questions of human worth, even the
worth of persons who display their lack of worth in, almost, their
every act, and, the kind of films of the late fifties and early sixties
that provided intelligent discussions of social issues.It's also a great movie if you just want to be entertained.",0,1962
596,14.0,6.3,"Atom Egoyan's Adoration weaves a complex tale of a young man searching
for the truth about his family by perpetuating a lie in order to
witness its consequences. Simon (Devon Bostick), a young high school
student, tells his class that his Lebanese father Sami (Noam Jenkins)
was a terrorist who attempted to blow up a plane with a bomb carried by
his pregnant wife, Rachel (Rachel Blanchard), a talented violinist. In
his presentation to the class, Simon says that he is the unborn child,
his mother was the innocent being led to her demise, and his father was
the killer out to murder 400 innocent people to promote a cause. The
only problem with the story is that it is not true. The incident never
happened. The film exposes the ease with which people are willing to
accept what they are told without question and how modern technology
has become a useful tool for those eager to disseminate falsehood.According to the director, the film is ""about people dealing with
absences. He (Simon) imagines having a father who is a demon; he wants
to go as far as possible into what that might mean."" Adoration begins
with an indelible image  a young woman standing at the end of a pier
overlooking a river playing the violin while her husband and young son
watch in awe. Moving forward and backward in time with great ease, the
film slowly constructs the events which have led to Simon's school
confessional. The key player is Simon's French teacher Sabine (Arsinée
Khanjian) whose own family was killed in Lebanon by a terrorist attack.
Sabine reads an article to the class about an incident that occurred in
1986 in which a Jordanian man, Nezar Hindawi, sent his pregnant Irish
girlfriend on an El Al flight with a bomb in her handbag, of which she
had no knowledge until it was discovered by Israeli airport security.Heavily influenced by his bigoted grandfather Morris (Kenneth Walsh) to
believe that his father intentionally caused his mother's death in a
car crash, the vulnerable Simon constructs a parallel between the
article read by his French teacher and the death of his parents. On his
own, Simon posts his fake story on the Internet and has to deal with
emotional responses from holocaust victims, holocaust deniers,
students, and professors talking about terrorism, martyrdom, and
heroism. It is a discussion that often sinks to the level of
victimization as portrayed by veteran actor Maury Chaykin who blames
the bogus airplane incident for ""ruining"" his life. Simon's uncle, Tom
(Scott Speedman), who raised the boy after his parents' death, acts as
a mediator between his nephew and the teacher who encourages Simon to
tell his fake story in the school auditorium.Tom is a tow truck operator with a short fuse who harbors a deep
resentment against his father for the way he was treated as a child and
his encounters with Sabine contain some of the film's most intense
moments. Aided by a tenderly evocative violin-prominent soundtrack by
Mychael Danna, Adoration is an intelligent and imaginative study of
family conflict and reconciliation that serves as a compelling probe
into human behavior and the ability to distinguish between fact and
fiction. Though it contains a great deal of ambiguity and character
motivations tend to be somewhat mystifying, Adoration is a very
involving film with performances that are uniformly excellent,
particularly Arsinee Khanjian as the emotionally-damaged teacher and
Speedman and Bostock who provide enough tension to keep us riveted
throughout.",101,2008

vivid character development without beating the viewer over the head.
And the acting was stellar. But other than that the movie was like a
predictable roller coaster ride (only because the acting was great, not
because I wondered where the ride was going). But the ending left me

dwindling hope that the movie would get better towards the end. Alas,
it did not! For a horror / thriller movie, then the only thing scary
about ""A Haunting in Cawdor"" was the lack of anything worthwhile and
the lack of anything to scare the audience. The story was slow-paced
and it just felt like torture since nothing interesting happened at any
time throughout the course of the movie.The story, or what is supposed to resemble a story, is about a group of
delinquents whom are sent to a remote location to participate in a
theater group in order to reduce their sentences. But something is
afoul in Cawdor.Right, well there was potential for something just remotely adequate in
a storyline here, but it was all butchered at the hands of the script
writers, and not particularly salvaged in the hands of director Phil
Wurtzel.The only thing that worked in favor of the movie was the casting of
Cary Elwes, Shelby Young and guy playing the helping hand / supervisor,
but I don't know his name. These three people actually put on
worthwhile acting performances and did what they could in terms to
salvage the movie. Although there was very little even they could do.For a horror movie released in 2015 then ""A Haunting in Cawdor"" was
just a very, very disappointing and non-entertaining addition to the
horror / thriller genre. Unless you are a fan of someone on the casting
list, then do yourself a favor and stay well clear of ""A Haunting in

602,8.666666666666666,7.6,"This is a very powerful and passionate documentary that tells the life
of the legendary Nina Simone in great fashion. With a brilliant
collection of stock footage that not only looks at Simone as a music
icon but also a hugely significant civil rights activist and a person,
this is a fascinating and engrossing documentary.Going into this, I knew next to nothing about Nina Simone. The Civil
Rights Movement has always been fascinating to me, but the musicians
involved, I didn't think much.However, this documentary makes all of that even more enthralling to
learn about, and extremely accessible to non-experts. If you haven't
ever heard of Nina Simone, you can easily go into this film and be
engrossed by the entire story.In terms of the way that this film tells the whole story, it's very
impressive. Structurally, it's a bit of a by-the-books documentary, but
if you get deeper into it, you discover that it's a very passionate and
fitting tribute to Simone's life.The first period of the film details her rise to fame in the jazz world
in the 1950s from her lowly beginnings in a southern town, and shows
you all sorts of fascinating clips from her childhood that show what a
struggle her journey was, and from her earliest performances that gave
birth to a genius in the music industry.With interviews from both herself and her closest friends and family,
you also get an extremely personal look into this story. For all of the
hype surrounding her musical talent, there's still a very touching
smaller story about Simone as a person. Ultimately, it's a sad story
that she suffered so much from personal demons and domestic issues,
however this film really allows you to empathise with a person that
was, at her time, so aggressive and loud.That's where the story about her as a civil rights activist comes in.
This film thinks very highly of her role in the entire movement,
rightly placing her amidst historical titans like Martin Luther King
Jr., Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael. It talks about how she brought
attention to the movement to a different crowd, and in a different way,
and despite her disagreements with King's non-violent protest tactics
and her support for a more aggressive approach, her importance cannot
be understated.Overall, this is a great documentary, that not only gives you an
accessible historical insight into the life of this incredible
personality, but one that will both entertain and fully engross you.www.themadmovieman.com",101,2015
603,10.4,6.9,"There's something rather wonderful about people who manage to do things
incredibly badly - William MacGonagall, the world's worst poet, and
Eddie the Eagle Edwards, the world's worst ski-jumper, spring to mind;
but Florence Foster Jenkins is in the pantheon as the world's worst
singer. I have a CD of the few recordings she made, and not the least
remarkable aspect of Meryl Streep's performance is that she superbly
captures La Jenkins' extraordinary singing voice. This, however, is
only one part of a beautiful performance, in which Streep gives us a
touchingly vulnerable Jenkins. I saw this film expecting to laugh - and
indeed there are some great comic moments. What I didn't expect,
however, was to find myself sympathising with the title character so
much, to the extent that I found myself rooting for her - not to give a
magnificent recital, but at least to BELIEVE that she had. Hugh Grant
plays Jenkins' sort-of husband (they never actually married in real
life, though the film implies that they did) and manager. It's a fine
performance, and he's lost none of his ease with comic scenes. He also
has some heartwarmingly touching scenes in which he gives Jenkins the
(platonic) love she is so desperate for, and when he tries to shield
her from the truth. Even so, I was never quite sure how to reconcile
this side of his character with the double-life he leads without
Jenkins' knowledge. Simon Helberg is excellent as Jenkins' much
put-upon accompanist, and Nina Arianda provides a good turn as a
gold-digger who displays some unexpected heart. Highly recommended.",111,2016
604,6.666666666666667,4.0,"DEAR GOD NO! is a straight-out homage to the grindhouse flicks of the
1970s; in particular it seems to be a cross between THE EVIL DEAD and a
random biker movie. Instead of being a real film, this is an ultra low
budget production packed to the brim with outrageously cheesy gore
effects, depraved humour, and female nudity.I found it repulsive in the extreme, but not for the reasons you'd
think. The exploitation elements are all well and good, but it's the
script that truly repulsed me. It's dumb beyond belief, full of
repetitive cursing and nothing else. The characters are portrayed as
the stupidest people imaginable, and despite the presence of a large
gang of bikers there are no individuals here - they're all a bland,
faceless group.The plot is non-existent and only serves to link the various
exploitation sequences. The degradation of women plays a pivotal role,
with the female roles limited to monsters, strippers, or victims.
Sleaziness hangs over the whole production, and as a whole this is the
type of film that nobody in their right mind could enjoy. Rodriguez's
PLANET TERROR is still my favourite of the grindhouse tributes in

611,14.0,7.4,"The Conjuring was a shocking horror film. It combined every creepy
trope you can think of (ghosts, dolls, music boxes, mirrors, you name
it), and it actually worked thanks to a genre-savvy director behind the
curtains. James Wan has proved himself a capable producer on projects
such as Saw and Insidious, and with The Conjuring, he cemented himself
as a master of the genre. It had the perfect amalgam of horror tropes
crafted in such a way that felt as fresh and spine-tingling as classic
haunted house movies did in the '80s. The Conjuring 2 is another ""based
on true events"" tale that has us follow expert paranormal
investigators, the Warrens, this time solving the mystery of the
Enfield Haunting. Similar to the Amityville Haunting, the Enfield Haunting sees an
English family plagued with a poltergeist that doesn't seem to enjoy
the presence of anyone in the house. What The Conjuring 2 succeeds at
is giving us both character development and another great story, which
is exactly what a good sequel should do. The acting is uniformly great,
but the true star of the film is James Wan. His shots are designed in a
way to imbue dread and stir it around our heads for a while before
hitting us with the scare. That's what true horror lacks these days,
patience. The longer the anticipation is built and the more atmosphere
is created, the more unsettling the situation becomes until it's like a
ticking time bomb that you anxiously wait to go off. It uses familiar
tropes, such as self-starting children's toys, slamming doors, and
smashing furniture, but they're used as tools to mask the truly
frightening fact that this family is up against something utterly
beyond their control - they're hopeless, and we can feel it.Mind you, The Conjuring 2 isn't without its faults. The runtime is a
blatant offender. Pushing the 2-hour mark is never a good idea for a
horror film, and some fat definitely could have been trimmed. There are
a handful of cheap scares, audio scares to be precise - when the music
gets extremely loud all of a sudden and you find yourself more annoyed
than scared, quickly reaching for the remote to turn the volume down at
the risk of enduring another ear drum shattering noise. It also doesn't
feel as unique as its predecessor, understandably due to the very
nature of sequels, but there are moments that drag on long enough to
remind you that the first Conjuring didn't have these plodding plot
points. For example, it takes about an hour for the Warrens to even get
to England. Also, while in the haunted house, they're able to sleep
through some horrifying sounds that would snap a bear right out of
hibernation. But these dull spots and plot inconsistencies are few and
far between.The Conjuring 2 is how a horror sequel should be done. It's slick,
stylish, fun, and at times, quite terrifying. When a horror movie makes
me want to turn on the lights as I go roaming around the house at
night, I consider that a job well done. The Conjuring 2, well done.",134,2016

isn't like a movie at all. It is so real that it sucks you into every
moment as though you were actually there. After the character
development, I was literally on the edge of my seat, with my elbows on

most precious diamonds). So, yes, the family are the victims, and the
revolutionaries are the villains. But in the end the whole story is
about them bribing their way out of the country. The most pathetic car
chase in movie history notwithstanding. And the worst deal a Jew has
ever made for transport services. What exactly is the moral here?Mind you, not a single scene or dialogue in the whole movie is remotely
believable.",110,2015
622,12.8,3.8,"One of the worse ghost stories that I have seen in recent years. I was
not scared at all. The filmmakers did a lackluster job with the film. It had a lot to it.
A woman comes to Singapore to find out why her sister took her life and
finds clues that something supernatural was involved. Not a hard story
to follow, but then they added in this extra story about a group of
priest looking into someone using computers to recreate the tower of
Babel, The stories interconnected real badly and I could not tell you
how the filmmakers drop the ball with what could have been a touch
down.It's not scary and it does not give me goosebumps or creeps me out. It
falls too flat to be any worth watching.",95,2016
623,4.666666666666667,6.8,"This film exceeded my already high expectations. The director and
screenwriter have delivered an amazingly acute study of high school
dialogue and interaction, while simultaneously exploring the polarizing
landscape of evangelical Christianity in America and still delivering
consistent laughs from start to finish.The acting is superb. Martin Donovan (who routinely shines in Hal
Hartley's films) here nimbly deconstruct his familiar grim sociopath
persona to depict one of the most nuanced anti-heroes ever seen in a
teen film. Jena Malone continues and deepens her fine work from Donnie
Darko, creating one of the most moving teen heroines in memory. Eva
Amurri is an inspired bit of casting as the multi-faceted school rebel
who's full of surprises. And... it's true, Macaulay Culkin can act--
and even carries more than one scene with his understated comic timingThe storyline itself often leans on contrivance, but the situations
presented ring true with an emotional depth rarely granted to pre-adult
characters, and none of the events will seem off the wall to anyone
familiar with modern adolescence or this particular religious
subculture.The film is blisteringly funny, unusually sharp in its look at
different types of people and their individual frailties, and sweet--
possibly even, despite what else you may have read elsewhere, too
sweet. The ending is the softest spot in the movie, but draws
effectively on the hard-won empathy for each character to float to a
graceful (ahem, pun intended) stop.To be perfectly honest, as a reviewer who grew up in a very similar
environment, I have to say that if the filmmakers could be accused of
any distortion of the truth, it is in making their 'villains' *too*
sympathetic, too keenly aware of their own flaws, and, in the end, too
readily aware of a larger world around them to accurately reflect the
worst elements of this belief system. All of the less-sympathetic
characters in this film could be drawn from a documentary (yes, even
Hilary Faye!)... if, that is, the documentary chose to edit out their
least savory moments.Of course, there are many good-hearted, well-meaning evangelicals in
the world, and they are ably represented by characters such as Mary's
mother, who makes mistakes, but who thinks more with her heart than her
dogma. But the indignant critics who are so intent on finding a mote in
the director's eye, because he dares to show how twisted some of their
fellow believers might be, might stop for a minute to wave a hand in
front of their own face, or their neighbor's, where they may just find
a log they've been trying to ignore.",92,2004

once in a while there comes a sequel which by far surpasses the ""first one"".
Brian Yuzna's ""Return Of The Living dead 3"" is one of those miraculous
exceptions. A simple story of love, parenthood and zombies turns out to be
one of the best horror films of all time, making the genre move forward both
in quality and in innovation.
There are some excellent performances, but the gore-effects take the lead
role in another job well done by FX wizard Screaming Mad
George.
It's hard not to be captured by the movie's unique sense of humour allied
to some ultra-violent scenes of pure horror and fantasy, that combine to
tell the tragic story of a young man, who sees his beloved girlfriend turned
into a flesh-eating creature that still loves him, but will sooner or later
have to eat him!

promising horror directors for the future. Don't miss this

626,12.5,6.8,"I saw the trailer of this a few weeks ago and some of the mysterious
and bleak nature of the shorts clips prompted that little voice inside
me, saying "" you won't be comfortable with it, but see it."" I wasn't
and I did.The plot unravels slowly with little hints as to its central theme
dotted about sensitively. It has you asking the question, what has
happened to Jackie? How does this figure Clyde she has recognised and
recoiled from on the CCTV monitors at work impacted on her lonely and
monochrome life ? The answers come quite slowly as she puts her head
into the lion's jaws of proximity to this danger man. A bit like the
pantomime responses I felt like saying, "" No, don't go any closer,he's
behind you; you'll be recognised."", failing to recognise myself that
something in her wants exactly that. In fact she receives from him
perversely, what no viewer might possibly expect, but then she has us
asking, is this payback time ? I'm not telling you, see the film ! The
unfinished business Jackie has with Clyde is what this film is about.The raw,down-at-heel, desperate, littered, high rise and windy Glasgow
streets and housing estates as the backdrop. Ordinary everyday people
get on with their lives oblivious of the drama being enacted in
Jackie's life and culminating in an protracted showdown. But this is
not the end. No, for all the unresolved grief, anger, erotic
fascination and damaged lives, there remains a hope born of the
unlikely. The film leads you away from the possibility, but ultimately
there is life after death in Red Road. No cheering music soundtrack
intrudes to romanticise what cannot possibly yield to only to the
mawkish. There is just silence, sounds of the street, machinery, public
transport and some well chosen tracks to create mood when required.
This is what the vintage among us identify as continental cinema, no
wonder they loved it at Cannes. This is not a film for audiences to
remain detached from; the sheer intimacy of the camera work and the
evolving personal destinies involved get you involved too,
uncomfortably. A home grown vignette of humanity wrestling with the
s..t that regularly happens !",113,2006

that film by far for me. The acting was incredible, stellar casting. I
was very impressed with the emotional level and the adrenaline of the
actors. The cinematography was also very well done. The set of the

629,15.0,4.6,"expectations of ""ah ha, the first human clone"" which should bring some
earth-shattering, new expose on the science of cloning - achieving what
no other scientists have been able to do. Of course, we have to throw
in the usual moral issues associated with cloning a human but here, in
this movie, things were treated rather differently.Yes, there were the elements I mentioned above. The science was mostly
hinted at and not in detail, which made me think at times what the
story was supposed to be telling us. What gradually grew to make me
like this movie was the tug-of-war between cold, unfeeling science and
the love that exists for family and human life, especially that for a
newborn so much so that, in his compassion, Victor, the genetic
scientist, withdrew from what he later regrets not having done, which
later culminates in hurt and pity.Shades of Frankenstein the movie may have on the surface but it deals
with deeper issues that influence and torment the different characters
in the story - Victor the scientist, his assistants who, in one way or
another, add to the mix of his work and the moralities involved, the
tormented misgivings of his caregivers who trust and place hope in
Victor's decisions which came too late, his wife who is also torn
between her compassion and revulsion, and the safety of their own two
little girls who are innocently caught up in the machinations. All of
these add up to a nicely-blended mix that pull at our sympathies and
yet horror at what we see coming. Last, but not least, is Victor's
failed experiment which also tugs us both ways with fear and then the
hurt that comes from the need for human closeness.This is a movie that elicits expectations and depending on what these
expectations are, it is little wonder we read the extreme poles of
ratings and reviews among users and critics.I, for one, enjoyed it. The low budget did hurt it a little, like the
somewhat thin group of protesters. A bit of camera work attempted at
giving it more substance with the illusion of bigger numbers, which did
not work too well. What was done well were the close-ups of individual
protesters that illustrated the hate and fear invoked.Whether, in this day and age, people would come out to protest human
cloning, we only have to look at the numbers coming out (on both sides)
on the issue of same-sex marriage.The lighting and camera angles, close-ups and deliberately out-of-focus
scenes helped contribute to the mystery and suspense.I also liked the added touch at the end on human evolution, though the
science was not explained. It is, after all, sci-fi and we have seen
throughout history that sci-fi has a way of becoming reality like those
from Jules Verne and a particular communication device used in a
classic star voyaging series that has survived for half a century to
this very day.Overall, a very good effort despite its low budget and thoroughly
enjoyable (for me).",81,2014
630,9.75,6.3,"In recent years, Idris Elba has been mentioned as a possible candidate
to play James Bond, but after watching Bastille Day, I think that the
role of Jack Bauer would suit him better. What that means is that
Bastille Day feels like an extended episode of 24, with echoes of Die
Hard and a weak political message to simulate relevance. Nevertheless,
I found it an entertaining film, with an interesting screenplay full of
complications for the main character to overcome in order to obtain
information which will take him to the terrorist group which planted a
bomb. But, was it really a terrorist group? The answer is complicated,
and that's the only thing Bastille Day has in its favor in order to be
differentiated from uncountable action movies with a similar style and
manufacture. And we also have Elba, who displays conviction and an
imposing presence in the leading role, helping us to overcome the
improbable situations in which his character gets constantly involved,
as well as the forced coincidences implemented by the screenplay to
ease or obstruct his mission. The performances from the rest of the
cast are adequate, and Bastille Day makes a good use of the Parisian
locations, adding a European taste to season the Hollywood formulas
exploited without any shame. On the other hand, I don't see the sense
of hiring an English and a Scottish actor (Elba and Richard Madden,
respectively) to play North American characters. It would have been
better to employ European agencies, instead of the worn-out presence of
the CIA and its well-known intrusions in foreign territory. But,
well... Bastille Day is co-produced by Amazon, so I comprehend the
necessity of reinforcing the idea of the United States as a worldwide
police which doesn't obey rules, but obtains results. In conclusion, it
isn't a very memorable experience, but I can give a moderate
recommendation to Bastille Day as a vacuous entertainment with the
adequate doses of action and suspense to justify the investment of our
time.",92,2016

adaptation, do yourself a favour, don't listen to the totally overly
harsh and unfair critics and go see it for yourself, you won't be
disappointed ! As the audience score proves._________________________________ Well I have just come out from the film. In general, it was AWESOME,
but I CAN see why it may have got some bad reviews. (No spoilers below)
I do think some things could have been better, I personally felt the
start was a bit rushed (but then again what do you expect trying to fit
a 15 hour game into a 90 minute movie !), and if I hadn't played the
games first or knew the series like I do then I may have got a little
lost. I felt the chemistry between Ratchet and Clank was a pretty
low-key until towards the end, but again technically they had only just
met so you couldn't expect them to have the bond they have got by the
later games in the series.For fans the film is a total dream full of references and little Easter
eggs. The first end credit scene made the film for me personally, so
make sure you stay a while once the movie's over ! Sadly I didn't see
as many planets as I'd hoped for which I was sad about, and the weapons
didn't make much of an appearance until toward the end either.I personally felt the second half was superior to the first, but I'm
not sure if that was because unfortunately by watching all the
previously released clips beforehand, I had kinda ruined it for myself
and seen all the main parts, which is my fault entirely.Anyway final verdict, it was great and guaranteed that if you're a fan
(OR a newcomer) then you will love it, I thoroughly enjoyed it, had
plenty of laughs and would definitely see it again. The humour was
good, the references were great and the characters were awesome as per
usual, as was the stellar voice acting by the series usual stars. We
saw much more out of Cora and Elaris than in the newest game too and
they're really decent characters. However there IS room for improvement
and I can see how some people may not enjoy it as much as others.I feel critics have been completely unfair and overly harsh on this
film, in terms of video game adaptations it's fantastic. They talk
about it as if they were expecting something from Pixar, bearing in min
Rainmaker had about a quarter of the budget for this movie than studios
such as Pixar and Dreamworks have, They did a bloody great job and
still produced a fantastic fun, colourful film and that's saying
something. Do yourself a massive favour and go see for yourself and

just HAD to go see it. So I drag my poor husband and we went to watch a
late show that was relatively full. I didn't tell him anything about
the movie and I watched him watching it. He actually really enjoyed it.
The movie was lovely. The movie itself was beautiful. The scenery was
set somewhere is rural England. There are green pastures, a castle and
beautiful stone walkways. We first meet Lou, a beautiful,charming, bubbly girly girl who is a
strong character but maybe a little too comfortable with her current
life and then we have Will. Dashing Will! Sarcastic, funny, a little
mean at first. They are world apart but through fate ( and Will
disabilities) they met and slowly realize what one possessed, the other
needs. Even if they never really knew it. As the movie progress, they falls for each other and we all fall for
them. I loved Emily as Lou and Sam as Will. They played their roles
perfectly and the chemistry between then was undeniable. I think
everyone should go and watch this movie if you love romantic comedy. It

feat- one I would classify more in the realm of Pan's Labyrinth than
something like The Ring. What it suffers from is completely misdirected
and misleading marketing which has done this gem a huge disservice. I'd watch it again. I'd recommend it to friends. Refrain from judging

taken advantage of a new policy to loosen hiring standards at the
police force and actually made it through despite efforts from all
directions to get them thrown out. They embark on their first
assignment, which is to turn around Commandant Lassard's beloved
precinct 16, which has been dubbed the worst precinct in the city and
given 30 days to turn around or suffer some major employee turnover, a
fate which is relentlessly helped along by the eternally butt- kissing
Captain Mauser. They display a spectacular feat of water-borne police
work, saving the academy and then return in the next movie to beat the
city's other police academy when it turns out that the governor decides
it's not worth the money to keep them both open.Oh, and of course you all realize who is in this thing, right? None
less than Sharon Stone, David Spade in his first film, and Tony Hawk in
an early stunt-skateboarding role! You gotta see this!This time, Commandant Lassard has come up with a scheme he calls
Citizens on Patrol (C.O.P. Get it? Get it?), in which he elaborates
slightly on the plot of the original movie. You see, the police force
has been stretched a little too thin and the public has developed a
negative opinion of them due to the fact that they can't be everywhere
at all times to stop every single crime in the city. So the natural
solution, of course, is to train the public as deputy police officers
and basically have briefly trained undercover cops all over the city. In fact, so close is the resemblance to the first movie that we are
even treated to a couple characters who are forced to join the police
academy or face jail time  an idea suggested, of course, by Mahoney
himself. This is the best part of the movie, by the way. There is a hilarious
gang of skateboarding punks who are disturbing the peace left and
right, headed by none other than David Spade, who is a hardened urban
predator if I've ever seen one. Thug life, baby!!Sharon Stone also has a relatively small role in the film, although
probably one of the ons that she would like to forget about, and
Lieutenant Harris is back after being gone for the last two movies. All
of the other relevant cast members return, with the addition of a new
group of misfits, like the token fat black guy, David Spade and his
idiot skateboarder friend, and Tackleberry's FATHER-in-law. Remember
that guy? Who is always gleefully punching out his son? I can't wait
until the grandparents start joining!But don't worry, until then we have Mrs. Feldman to hold us over.
Here's this sweet old lady living in a nursing home/military barracks
and who has more of a love of all things camouflaged than Tackleberry
himself. In fact, I was waiting the whole movie for her to tell her
that she's his long lost mother, but no such luck. Something went wrong
with the screen writing in there somewhere, but ultimately she turns
out to be one of the most consistently funny characters in the movie.
She's played with a good-natured smile by Billie Bird, who clearly
enjoyed herself while making the movie. You can always tell when the
actors are having a good time, and it always makes the movie better,
which is good because this movie needs a lot of help!Of course, it's not much different than the last three movies as far as
being worth watching. Bud and his father are still trading punches and
it's still more groan-inducing than laugh- inducing, people are still
accidentally wandering into the Blue Oyster Club, which hasn't been
funny for three movies by now (Proctor inadvertently wandering in naked
was the high point of this gag, but also the point where it becomes the
most clear that the joke has lost its steam), and Jones is still doing
that Bruce Lee impersonation which was funny in the first movie when I
was a kid, but as an adult not so much But, Callahan has a great wet
t-shirt scene that makes the whole movie worthwhile!Oh, and was Mahoney's mischievous grin ever amusing? That poor guy,
man. His reputation has for some reason become so tarnished that he is
seen by most of the public as even more of a washed up has-been than,
umm, well no one else really comes to mind. Bill Paxton? Nah, he's
cool, I think. I never needed to forgive him for Weird Science, but
Guttenburg unfortunately has a whole string of bad sequels to make up
for, and Cocoon and Short Circuit are just not gonna cut it! At any
rate, super-gluing the loudspeaker to Harris' face was funny, but why
they missed out on the opportunity to have Harris screaming through it
at high volume at the doctors in the hospital I just can't understand.
The screenwriters are not scoring many points in this one!But still, this is one of the better Police Academies so far. This one
and part 3 are the best ones in the series that I've seen so far,
despite the hilarious 1980s badness (there's a boot- legging crime
lord, for example, who operates his illegal warehouse standing around
with a fistful of cash and a hula hoop around his shoulders), but there
definitely are some fun gags. Harris macing his armpits is one is one
of the more memorable gags in the whole series, along with Mauser
getting his hands glued to his hair, and I have to admit that I enjoyed
some of the scenes of the original recruits trying to recruit the
public for the new C.O.P. program. It's not a good movie, but it's a

throughout the city. Crime is rampant and the people are afraid to
leave their homes because of a local crime wave. A group of young punks
(led by Bobcat Goldwait) have recently assaulted the chief of police
(Howard Hesseman). With the city in turmoil and with his job being
threatened by the Chief's right hand man, he turns to the new recruits
to help clean up the city.I hate it when they franchise a movie and tone down the raunchy humor
and crude manners, elements that made the first one a success. The
movie is funny but it's not as good as the first film. Sadly the
creativity and humor of the Police Academy films goes down the eventual
slippery slope. By the fifth film the series becomes very unwatchable
and extremely redundant. Even though it's a step down from the first
film, it's still entertaining.Recommendx",87,1985

651,16.0,5.9,"This was one of the most surprising finds in recent years. It
absolutely has no right, whatsoever, to be as entertaining as it is. If
you are a horror fan you are in for a treat as it solidly checks off
every box one can imagine. Its varied yet interlocking tales serve up
something for almost every taste. From ghost story to evil old god
worship to body horror to home invasion thriller it merrily jumps about
in a way that could have proved confusing and offsetting but, instead,
seems to act more as a museum tour on all the things that make us check
the locks and fear the shadows.While there will, no doubt, be some debate as to what the pocket
universe we are presented with represents, there is no doubt, in my
mind, that it represents a person or persons who made a movie from an
old school heart with a modern day sensibility. As stated in the
summary it very much reminds me of the best of the classic horror
comics such as the EC Comics titles which began their lives in the very
early 1950's.That being said do not mistake this for an old fashioned movie. It is
very much genre savvy for today's eyes, ears and mind. In almost total,
it is well acted, directed, written, scored and there is a fair share
of completely creepy cinematography. It will leave one with both
haunting imagery as well as interesting trains of thought to follow, if
you dare.Huge hats off to those who gifted us with this. This is how good horror
can be and I truly hope it finds its way to a far higher place in this
world than the vast majority of horror that tends to cross my eyes
these days.",89,2015
652,6.0,4.8,"I wish I could give a better review of this movie but I just can't. I'm
really not sure what caused the horribly painful to watch acting but I
think it was the script and the director/producer. I've seen Luke Perry
and Danielle Campbell act and they are better than they were in this
movie. This could have been a really great and moving film and it's a
shame that it wasn't. I like Danielle Campbell and Luke Perry which is
why I watched the film in the first place. There should have been more
real emotion. I've seem both actors give better performances. The horse
riding was awful. The dialogue was fake it seemed trite. Very
disappointed. Too bad it can't be remade with a better script and

conventional Hollywood standards, but an epic for Corman) and is a
well-acted, tightly directed, enjoyable not-quite-so-little picture. The

Italian general who has been imprisoned by the Nazis, Corman makes good

well handled, the picture looks much more expensive than its budget would

659,10.6,7.4,"A movie-like thing masquerading as a period noir buddy cop comedy. I've
read a number of reviews so far and one thing that almost everyone
agrees on, even those who like the movie, is that the screenplay is a
big hot mess. There is no momentum to the story, which is somehow both
predictable and unfocused. As soon as Kim Bassinger's character shows
up we know where this is all going but who cares anyway? The movie
attempts to swerve towards the broadly comic and surreal but is not
inspired enough to revel in its own fun and allow the audience to
forgive the meandering and ultimately nonsensical plot for the window
dressing that it is. The characters lack sharp definition and development. Gosling and Crowe
give whatever glimmer of hope there is to this movie but the material
is not worthy. They may have been miscast but its almost impossible to
tell due to the writing. Their characters are not very likable,
consistent or distinguishable from each other(important with odd couple
dynamics). Supporting characters are not the fun colorful characters one would
hope to have from such a movie. Gosling's daughter character is played
by a talented young actress but unfortunately this is one of the worst
elements of the movie. The child character who behaves like an adult is
a cringe worthy staple of Hollywood and that is exactly what we get
with in this movie. And why in a buddy cop movie are you focusing so
much attention on buddy cop's 12 year old daughter? Why?? You could
have a romantic interest or a fun villain but no, we get a third wheel
Nancy Drew character.From the beginning the daughter character is forced into the plot like
this is a four quadrant family friendly comedy and I inwardly groaned
as I realized that I was going to have to live with this decision by
the screenwriters. This film has a rather bizarre obsession with
children and even weaves in inappropriate porn jokes and adult
situations with children in ways that I found off- putting, and I love
South Park and edgy humor involving kids so that's saying something. The movie is too scattershot and all over the place. Worst of all, its
not very funny. There are maybe three moments in the movie that are
chuckle worthy and they are featured in the trailer. The filmmaker has
fun with the 1977 setting but this movie could have taken place in 2016
or 2026 or 2177, it doesn't matter.",116,2016
660,6.0,7.5,"In a word... ""Flat."" Seeing this remake only left me wanting to see the
old cartoon once again. I loved the old cartoon as a kid and can easily
recall many details decades later. Conversely, I just saw the new one
and it just blends in with a bunch of other fantasy-adventure
/superhero / CGI remakes of late.In general, this remake just felt like it had no soul.In particular, they didn't develop the characters much. It was obvious
the film-makers didn't care about the main characters much so why
should we either? I guess the special effects or CGI were impressive,
especially the talking animals, but that's been done so much its just
not a big deal anymore. They can't base a whole movie on those effects
anymore and just touch on a few songs. The singing and music in the old
version was so much more developed, energetic and memorable.The guest voice-overs were good but too recognizable. I kept thinking
of Bill Murray talking into a mic instead of watching the fake bear
talk. To be fair, Ben Kingsley pulled off the character very smoothly.
But why did they make that orangutang so huge? Was he King Kong's lost
brother? And voiced by Christopher Walken it really didn't make sense.
Jungle animals are already awesome, you don't need to enlarge them or
make up new ones.A high point of the movie was when Mogli helped the elephant baby from
the pit. More of this tenderness would have been welcome, which brings
me to the next point...This story was always potentially very violent; we're talking about
jungle law here- brutal life and death is always near. But while the
old cartoon version separated that violence enough from reality to make
it safe and enjoyable for a younger audience, the new one crossed the
line. It was too real, in my opinion, for most kids under about 11 or
so. True, many kids play violent computer games from earlier ages now,
so some would argue they can ""handle it"", but is that the kind of trend
for them you want to support? I would argue the more we desensitize the
youth now, the less sensitive they will be later on when they may be
taking care of us when we're seniors. Do we want such thoroughly
insensitive people running society in the future? So, while yes- it was
exciting, I think this production really narrowed their audience down
to the preteens (for whom it may be too violent) and the teenagers (for
whom it may be too kiddie- you know with the talking animals and all).
So sorry Disney, I've so often loved your movies, but not this time.",106,2016
661,11.0,7.7,"""Outback"" is unlike any other film ever made and quite impossible to
categorize. If the movie taught me anything at all, it's that the
Aussies can drink seriously hard and loads of it. They even drink till
they pass out and then immediately open another can when they come to
their senses again. I thought only Belgians did that. You cannot
possibly count the amount of beer cans and bottles that are consumed in
this film and the most repeated line of text/monologue is without a
doubt: ""C'mon mate, let's have a drink then"". Based on the novel by
Kenneth Cook, ""Outback"" tells the story of a young school teacher
visiting the little outback community of Bundanyabba, where the local
population is so hospitable and acts so familiar it becomes truly
disturbing. They fill their days with drinking, gambling, getting
involved in bar fights, drinking again, kangaroo hunting and drinking
some more. John initially disapproves their savage habits and looks
somewhat down upon the villagers, but slowly and gradually he becomes
one of them as he wastes his entire year salary on booze and primitive
roulette games. ""Outback"" is very slow-paced and moody. Sometimes you
can literally taste the copious amounts of liquor and experience the
heat of the Aussie summer. The noticeable heat, together with the
feeling pure geographical isolation truly makes the film disturbing and
uncomfortable as hell. ""Outback"" works effectively as psychological
drama but even more as the non-fictional portrait about a society that
is largely unknown and unspoken of. The footage of the kangaroo hunting
trip is haunting and very, very depressing. I was really relieved when,
during the end credits, a message appeared on the screen to state that
no real kangaroos were harmed during the production. The film mostly
benefices from astonishingly mesmerizing photography, superb music and
Ted Kotcheff's solid direction. The versatile and brilliant actor
Donald Pleasance is even convincing as an Aussie drunkard and the rest
of the relatively unknown cast delivers great performances as well.

in a lifetime, but it's incredibly obscure so if you find a copy
treasure it. So mate  shall we have a beer then?",108,1971
662,7.5,4.0,"At least there are some big names in this campy horror film to keep us
occupied. Double billed on a new blue ray with ""Ghost House"", Witchery
has David Hasselhoff (post Knight Rider, but before Baywatch) and Linda
Blair (waaaaaaay after Exorcist). Another Italian horror film, filmed
in Massachusetts, this one is directed by Fabrizio Laurenti. Like the
Lenzi horror films, this one is so campy, so bad, that its kind of fun
to watch. And who IS that Lady in Black? She and her magic gemstone pop
up now and then, adding to the mystery. A real estate agent tries to
sell a house on a private island, but Gary (Hasselhoff) and his
assistant entered the house (without permission) to take photos. Jane
(L. Blair) has her own secrets, as you will see. More cheesy special
effects, and of course, the usual blood and gore. I'm surprised that
Linda Blair still wanted to do films like this, since she was so well
known for The Exorcist. It's pretty creepy. And as of today, only 3 out
of 10 stars on IMDb.The ""story"" starts out pretty solid, unlike most oldie horror films.
The acting and directing are a bit lame, but everyone does a pretty
good job with the lines they are given. For a lot of of the cast, this
is the only film they ever made. About two thirds of the way through,
the plot gets weird and goes down these left turns. Lots of screaming,
organ music, and smoke. Similar plot to Ten Little Indians, where the
guests get knocked off, one by one. Interesting, if just for the
historical value.",95,1988
663,12.0,4.4,"Starting from a good idea, the director/writer totally screws it up, in
my humble opinion. I started watching this because of the '100%
medically accurate'-marketing, as I'm a student in medicine. It was far
from accurate or realistic.. Not medically, not in any way. I'm only a
student and still see some big mistakes. Obviously they hadn't even a
nurse on the set.-The odds that two random persons are compatible to each other are
quite low (that's one of the problems with organ-transplant). How lucky
is he that the two girls match! And since the third guy isn't, he just
go grab a random Japanese guy out of his backyard, who apparently
hasn't a clue what he's doing in Germany(let alone Europe). He doesn't
speak neither English nor German nor any other language except for
Japanese.-Girl number 2 shows rejection signs at the end of the movie. Which
shows that: a- the doctor hasn't worked sterile (he scratches his
forehead during the operation, an error a regular surgeon would never
do) or b-he didn't gave immuno-suppressing medication, a real doctor
would never oversee such a thing or c- they didn't matched (but as you
can see prior to the operation, he had them tested).-About that test: as far as I know, it's not the kind of test you can
run in your basement, and I really doubt that you can make a lab do
that from anonymous people for someone without a practitioners license
anyway. As he is 'retired' (most likely fired for his dog-experiment),
it' s very highly likely that he hasn't got his license anymore (= no
professional secrecy possible).-By far the most hilarious error is when he has his stethoscope in his
ears.. He has it in the wrong direction!!! A stethoscope should be worn
so that the ear-canal and the branches of the stethoscope are in the
prolongation of each other. Like he is wearing it, it makes a small
angle. This is something anyone with paramedical knowledge would see
right away. (please feel free to search the internet for proper
stethoscope wearing instructions if I didn't made myself clear on this
point)-If I were a very sick-minded ex-surgeon, I would have connected their
blood-circuit. Without it, survival is impossible from the start.
First: you can't survive eating excrement from just one person, second:
as the urinary tracts are not connected either, the second and third
subject would die from dehydration even before they'd die from hunger
and third: connecting the rectum with the mouth makes it possible for
bacteria from the lower gastric tract (f.e. E.Coli) to infect the upper
gastric tract of the second person resulting in diarrhea in the first
place, probably followed by generalized infection and death later on.
There's a reason why the intestinal tract is segregated.-And my last point is the following: the second girl dies -apparently-
from generalized infection. If that's the case, the first girl would be
evenly infected. You should also be aware that dying from generalized
infection is quite a slow death involving very high fever and tissue
necrosis, which she doesn't shows symptoms of.Except from the medical point of view there are other illogic things:
the police's behavior towards the doctor, the neighbors hearing
screams(but not another house in sight, and the police shows up very
late compared to when the screams might have been heard). And how the
hell did the doctor managed to plant the scalpel in the first
policeman's neck while unable to do anything else but crawling?Furthermore, there is nothing innovating compared to other horror
movies. (See colleagues' reviews) I think I made my point clear, but if
realism doesn't bother you, you might like it. Although I really doubt

667,18.333333333333332,5.9,"I saw Hostel tonight with a crowd that was very receptive to the
experience. Mine was more hostile. The film opens like a teen sex
comedy. We are meant to identify with three young guys, who's idea of
fun is getting high and having sex with prostitutes. This first section
is littered with naked women, in what might just be the least sexy
presentation of naked women anywhere. One can sense director Eli Roth
and his cronies giving each other high fives off-camera, much like the
silhouetted threesome early on in the film, as they pay surgically
enhanced women to take their clothes off. The three men find themselves in Slovakia, and in what is referred to
as an art show or an exhibit. Rich men have paid Russian gangsters to
torture and ultimately murder a human being, our heroes? subjects? One
by one, the men are tortured and killed in escalating graphic manners.
The final man escapes, is involved in a car chase, and ultimately
becomes what he was trying to escape.This is, at its black heart, a very dumb movie. Probably, the most
clever thing in the film, is the very weak parallel drawn between the
legalized red light district in Amsterdam, and the illicit torture
rooms in Slovakia. Everything else is just baloney. We don't really
care about the three men, so the tortures that they endure aren't
really effective at eliciting any sympathy, it's more that we're glad
it's not happening to us. The motivations for the men that torture is
never made clear, it's more a general sociopathic disconnect that's
vaguely hinted at. It's also worthwhile noting that the one character
that seems to be gay is singled out as the worst of the torturers,
further contributing to the filmic stereotype of homosexual as
homicidal.One should also note the historical context of the film. This is an
American movie, about torturing people, made at a time when America,
right or wrong, is receiving flak for torturing prisoners in Iraq and
elsewhere, and makes no mention of the current world situation.It's also worth noting that the audience I watched this picture with

668,14.0,4.7,"So, what do we have here with that movie ""Parlor"", or, as I found it in
some places, ""Anarchy Parlor"".The movie starts off in Lithuania, where the movie was shot entirely. A
bunch of U.S. students makes a joyride to hang out, party and have the
occasional sex with friends and local chicks. So, first of all - a lot
of nudity is included, many hot ladies and their goods show up on the
screen - for me personally surely a huge plus. Especially gorgeous Beth
Humphreys is a win win !So far, this pretty much is analogue to ""Hostel"" - and I have to admit,
I am a bit tired of eastern European countries painted as ""backwood
countries"", where only uneducated, cold hearted people live. I am
married to a Croatian girl, and the people there and in the near
countries are friendly, polite and very nice :-) But well, I see what
they tried to do - foreign, dangerous surroundings, no one will help
you. Okay then.The story is about a tattoo shop named ""Parlor"", and some sinister
happenings around the shop and it's owner. Here comes the one and only
Robert LaSardo - for than time for him to get a lead role, since
basically everyone (!) has seen him in at least a bunch of movies,
usually as the gang member, criminal, or something this way.Also, a huuuuuuge eye candy factor is well known tattoo model (and from
time to time ""actress"" Sara Fabel - I love tattooed girls, and I have
for some unknown reason a faible for angry girls...? So, on top she has
a smoking hot body, so she was, in my eyes, another big plus for this
movie, despite her acting skills being average - in the best case.
Basically she is not good, but being hot and angry is enough for me to
have no further complaints about her :-DThere is some pretty rough gore - I would not consider ""Parlor"" as
torture porn or even a ""hard"" movie. In my opinion, as someone who has
- literally - seen thousands of horror movies, some tough scenes do not
make the complete movie a ""hard movie"", but well, some scenes are not
for people with sensitive stomachs. Tattoos, some torture, some Hostel
parallels - I guess you can figure out where that goes.The acting, in general, is pretty average, even from beloved Robert
LaSardo - he is a unique type of guy, not a good actor. I like to
compare that to Zombieboy, same here (but he is not in this movie - he
probably should have been though !). But, we are watching a low budget
horror movie here - I don't expect Oscar worthy acting, so that's okay.The effects were well done in most scenes. Without wanting to spoil you
I can say, that there is at least one scene including a gun, where the
effects were clearly made in Adobe After Effects, and not by a
professional, so that looked ugly. All other scenes were okay.Did I mention that there is a LOT of nudity? In clubs, strip bars,
hotel bedrooms and so on.I did not like the ending a lot, to be honest, but again I am used to
this from many, many other movies. At least it does not let open any
questions or something, and yes, of course the end offers room for a
possible sequel - which I would watch, definitely. In summary ""Parlor"" is a well executed horror movie with an awesome
cast in terms of tattoo fans (LaSardo and Fabel are icons in this
scene, to which I do belong) and in terms of hot girls going naked.
Average acting, a plot that offers nothing new, a forgettable
soundtrack and some mean gore scenes make it a 6 point movie, which
probably is rated a bit too high for this movie in general - but I give
it, because it fitted my expectations - no, it was better even than I
expected.To make it as short as possible thus closing the circle to the title of

tattoos, gore and tits? :-)Fully recommended !",98,2015

fourth quarter 09 release for 'Brief Interviews' in the States, and
curiously Greece, at the Athens Film Festival, John Krasinski's
adaptation of American maverick David Foster Wallace's book of the same
name is something that you really shouldn't allow to go under your
radar.This shortish film (eighty or so minutes, dependent upon the version
you see) has many head-spinning nuances that warrant your attention.
Personally, this was a surprising turn for Krasinski, who displays a
brilliant eye for a project and impresses upon his audience an ability
far outweighing his popular persona of goof or funny man. It is
delightful to see a harder, more serious edge to him. I was both
shocked and delighted by this film and have happily become a convert of
Krasinski's work, but on a whole new level.Having not read the Wallace book and knowing little about the film
prior to watching it, I feel I have benefited from not having any
pre-conceptions about the story or how Krasinski decided it should be
filmed.I am grateful for the fact that I went about my usual business and
avoided the reviews that had gone before me, as most reviewers have
found that they either love or loathe it. Regardless, the film cannot
be ignored once seen, and opinions abound about its relevance. Such is
the subject matter and wealth of passionate feelings it both incites
from its audience and the messages it dares to tell us about ourselves.The 'Hideous Men' of the title are few and far between, however, and
this may be different in the book, but the majority of a clearly
hand-picked multitude of talented actors come across as having opinions
on women that are heard all too infrequently. You get the impression
that these voices would have remained unheard had a tape recorder and a
camera not been placed in front of them and the right type of questions
posed from an apparently unassuming and coercive questioner.The acting talent throughout is exemplary, with one notable exception.
Our lead Julianne Nicholson came across as slightly average through an
uninventive, passionless and oblique performance as Sara Quinn. This is
quite possibly due to her fellow performers and who can be surprised.
These hideous men we come across all deliver outstanding monologues
with Krasinski, Dominic Miller, Michael Cerveris and Frankie Faison
being particular examples of unmissable, gripping talent.The story is simple enough, Quinn is interviewing men on the back of a
project to understand the progress of feminism and decides that the
best way to understand at least half of that would be to interview men
on their feelings about women, taking a broad cross-section of subjects
to get as broad a result as possible.What we get is a warts and all (and I do mean all) story about how some
of these men view women in general. How some are unmoved in their
philosophy and how others, at the more cognitive end of the masculine
spectrum have started to realise that maybe this isn't their world
after all. While some are bitter or delighted, most are confused by
their relationships with the women in their lives, but all of them are
nonetheless vocal about their feelings, even if those feelings are not
what Quinn would really like to hear.With an impressive cast, who appear to be mostly right on form, a
screenplay adapted by Krasinski that is at times witty, funny and above
all brilliantly observed by Wallace and some impressive editing by Zene
Baker and Rich Fox, Brief interviews With Hideous Men is both a lesson
of our times for men and women everywhere with meaning in every line.
This makes romantic comedies seem dire by comparison and I would
suggest that even though this is most definitely a look at
relationships as much as anything else, it would be wise to avoid it
when picking a DVD for a second date, as this raises some uncomfortable
questions that are thankfully not glossed over with comedy.A real treat for fans of rational thought and superlative acting
skills.",0,2009
672,6.5,6.2,"""Dough"" is a film brand new to DVD and is available from Netflix...and
I strongly recommend you give it a try. This is because this British
movie is very fresh and original...and is far better than I'd expected
given what I knew about the plot. Just be forewarned...you might not
like the characters initially...stick with it, you won't be sorry!When the film begins, young Ayyash (Jerome Holder) is an unemployed
African man living in London. His plan to get himself and his mother
out of poverty is to sell drugs for a particularly nasty thug. However,
his mother is looking out for him and when her employer, Nat (Jonathan
Pryce), is in need of an apprentice in his bakery, she introduces
Ayyash to him. As for Ayyash, he only agrees to do the job as a
cover...he assumes most of his money will come about by selling drugs. As for Ayyash and Nat, they have no reason to get along of like each
other. After all, Nat is an old Orthodox Jew and Ayyash is a young
black Muslim--not exactly natural friends. However, and this is what I
loved about the film, over time the odd pair began to grow on each
other and actually care about each other. Yet, at the same time, it
didn't come off as clichéd or ridiculous.One day, Ayyash is making bread and some of his marijuana falls into
the batch. He tells no one but the bread turns out to be a hit...and
Ayyash decides to use more pot in his baking because he wants to help
out Nat because his business is failing. Soon, they have more customers
than they could have dreamed of and Nat doesn't suspect why this is the
case. As for what happens next, you'll just have to watch the film for
yourself.This film easily could have been a goofy comedy but instead shied away
from overt comedy. Instead, the filmmakers wisely chose to make the
story much more character-driven instead of going for the cheap laughs.
As a result, you really grow to like the characters and their
interaction is at times quite sweet. Both actors did a great job with
the material and the film is one that only gets better as the movie
progresses. Well worth seeing and a very nice picture that took me by
surprise.",94,2015
673,10.25,5.6,"I met the director at an event, and she asked me to watch the film on
Amazon Prime and write a review to undo so many trolls on here. After
reading the reviews on this page, I see exactly what she means. People
who enjoy the film just watch it, and people who have nothing better to
do with their time, feel the need to trash other people's hard work.
For starters, this is a low-budget, independent film and should be
compared to other similar projects. I feel sometimes like there should
be a separate section for independent films on these film websites so
people can know the difference. I watch films for their story. When I
saw that it was about 5 women in the woods, I rolled my eyes thinking
I've seen this before a million times. But I was pleasantly surprised,
that it was a very different film. It's not some guy with a machete,
it's something very unique and I really appreciated that. There's very
little that hasn't been done in horror. I also really enjoyed the
acting, which is not always the case in these lower budget films. It
reminded me a little of The Descent, with the all-female cast, but
obviously on a much lower budget.",85,2016

675,4.5,4.3,"What drove me into this film? Well, that is hard to describe since in
English there apparently doesn't exist an equivalent word for the
German term ""Schadenfreude"". But allow me to elaborate: I am a sucker
for bad movies. I love the Ed Wood and Al Adamson flicks, Italian
cannibal flicks, German schnitzel-westerns, Ninja flicks from Hong
Kong, Greek porn-comedies, etc. I openly admit and repent not. Yes, I
do own a copy ""Saving Christmas"" and watch every Kirk Cameron flick
(again: ""Schadenfreude""). I only realized that there was a sequel to
the original train-wreck when somebody pointed out that ""Batman vs.
Superman"" is only doing so well at the box-office because there was no
competition apart from a handful of bible-thumping-flicks. So I took a
pilgrimage of-sort (the only cinema that showed it was about an hour's
drive away) and to put it into the words of the target-audience, let me
now testify to what I hath witnessed and speaketh unto thee: Long story
short (remember: this story prattles on for more than two hours, though
it actually feels a lot longer): Melissa Joan Hart (best  and
ironically  remembered for her lead in the TV-show ""Sabrina, the
teenage witch""; Catchphrase ""Woohoo!"") plays a high school teacher, who
is suddenly overcome with that ol' itch and begins to sermonize to her
students about her believe  in history-class, no less. The logic
consequence ensues and she's given the boot, just as a math-teacher
would get canned, if he began to preach that one and one is the Holy
Trinity. But, unwilling to understand that a school isn't a church, she
goes to court and fights for her ""god-given"" right to preach to
children in a class-room.Now, imagine that scenario: your child comes home from school and, when
asked what he/she had learned that day, he/she replies that the god
Ganesha has an elephant head (History-class), the basics of L. Ron
Hubbard's Dianetics (English-Literature-Class), the basics of Alchemy
(Science) and Phrenology-101 (Biology). And that the P.E.-teacher was
handing out communion wafers and splashed the students with holy water.
I presume that most people would be like ""WTF!?"" and sue the school for
all it's worth. So would any fire-and-brimstone-cussing evangelist. But
we're not talking any old heathen religion (Catholicism, Judaism,
Hinduism, you name it), we're talking about the ""real deal""  which may
sound cynical to some readers, but that is exactly the stance this
""movie"" and its ilk takes.Sure, we could argue that religion should be taught in school. Plenty
of time for the kids to learn about all those countless deities, gods
and demi-gods, from Zeus to Odin to Jehovah, and to heck with history,
geometry and basic science. I can guarantee you one thing: By the end
of the semester, those kids won't even be able to read and write
properly, but will be convinced that people once-upon-a-time rode on
dinosaurs and slew dragons.Back to the film: of course ""God is not Dead 2"" tries to establish
itself as some Anti-""Inherit the Wind"". All the Christians are
portrayed as saints and martyrs, thrown into the lion-pits of a cruel,
unjust (and ungodly) world, which wants nothing more than to take away
their crutch for reality. ""We are the victims and everybody else is the
enemy"", is the prevailing message, and it makes it very clear, why many
Christian fundamentals are considered the American answer to the
Taliban. If this sentiment would have been around in the 1940's, surely
a Nazi war-criminal would have jumped up at the Nuremberg trials,
demanding that the judge ""stop oppressing me!"" And if you ask me about
acting, editing, production-values and everything else that goes with a
real movie: well, it's a two-hour-plus sermon, featuring either zealots
or washed-up has-beens, happy to see the front of a camera. And sure,
there'll be plenty of claqueurs, who'll clap and cheer this flick,
calling it the greatest thing since Noah's flood, etc. But don't let
yourself be fooled. It's trash, no matter how you look at it. Again, if
you have seen ""Inherit the Wind"", you might remember how that film
ended; hence, here goes the mandatory one point out of ten.",120,2016

different route with the paranoid performance from Roy Schnieder.
Unfortunately some other of the other performances are quite poor, with the
standard dumbed down cops. Slow to pick up, it's worth sticking with past
the stock plot setup routines. There's some neat camera work to strengthen
the guessing game and make you feel the paranoia and fear of the doctor.
There's a fantastic sequence in central park where the Doctor follows a
mystery woman, losing her beneath the light \ dark pools of street lights.
Using the sound of her footsteps to pull your attention forward to a tunnel.

677,15.166666666666666,6.4,"'Enigma' is the kind of war movie that may not be loved by many people,
mostly because there isn't much of action to be seen in it. At least,
not the kind of action they would like to see: no heroically fighting
soldiers, no breathtaking dogfights between the RAF and the
Luftwaffe... But people like me, who are deeply interested in every
aspect of the Second World War and who can appreciate a good story,
certainly will love it.It's March 1943 and the crypto-analysts at Britain's code-breaking
center have discovered that the German U-boats have changed their
Enigma Code. At first the English were able to read all their messages,
but now they are back where they first started ... nowhere. Their only
hope is the brilliant young man named Tom Jericho, who was able to
crack the first code and who'll now have to do the same with the new
one. In the meantime Tom's girlfriend Claire has disappeared and at the
same time it is believed that there is a spy in the ranks of the
code-breakers. When looking for his lost girlfriend and investigating
her personal life, he uncovers some personal and international
betrayals...However it is clear that the main story of this movie is fictional, the
entire movie is certainly interesting to watch. I mean, I have never
had the chance to see how this enigma machines really worked, so I
really appreciated the fact that it was shown so well in this movie.
What I also liked in this movie was the love story that certainly
wasn't too corny or overwhelming. It was an interesting part of the
story that never bothered me, it just made the movie even better. As I already said, this may not be the kind of war movie for the
masses, but I liked it and that's why I give it at least a 7.5/10,

attraction, though, is Mr. Moore himself, who's given two opportunities
on screen to launch into two of his routines, one about a black named

attempts revenge on a bullying lion. The script by co-star Jerry Jones

681,8.0,6.6,"During an orbital exploratory mission to Mars, Commander Christopher
Draper (Paul Mantee) and Colonel Dan McReady (Adam West) are forced to
take evasive maneuvers to avoid a large meteor. They inadvertently put
themselves in a position for Mars' gravitational pull to take over, and
they're running out of fuel. Thus first Draper, then McReady eject.
Draper finds himself alone, Robinson Crusoe style, and must figure out
how to survive.Director Byron Haskin and company spared no expense to make sure that
all of the scientific elements of this film were accurate enough to
function as a graduate level ""motion picture textbook"" for planetary
sciences courses, and the special effects are so realistic that even
Peter Jackson felt that his Lord of the Rings trilogy fell short of the
technical wizardry on display here. Of course I'm joking. The truth is
that while Robinson Crusoe on Mars is extremely cheesy in many
respects, this is a very fun film, with a gripping, often-suspenseful
story and a great sense of adventure. It rises above its flaws to merit
an 8 out of 10 from me.Actually, Robinson Crusoe on Mars is a great example of why science
fiction is usually considered to belong to the genre umbrella of
""fantasy"" (and yes, that's even true of literary ""hard science
fiction""). Even though they often involve plot points based on
technical aspects of the sciences--and believe it or not, this film is
primarily focused on that--in their broader structures, the stories are
usually fantasy tales, and reality is dispensed with as soon as either
(1) it doesn't suit what the author considers to be a good story, (2)
the author's scientific knowledge/research reaches its limit, or (3)
the author engages in speculation (which is fundamental to the genre).Despite scriptwriters John C. Higgins and Ib Melchior frequently
engaging in (1) (and very likely (2) plus an added departure point for
films--budgetary limitations), the suspense in the first half of the
film is propelled by Draper's need for oxygen, water and food. These
are basic concerns that many other ""shipwrecked on a planet"" films
often bypass through some kind of deus ex machine. In Robinson Crusoe
on Mars, they never stop being central to the plot. Admittedly, if
every film merely dwelled on those issues, we'd quickly grow tired of
it, but it works extremely well here.Even more remarkable, for the majority of the film, Robinson Crusoe on
Mars is a one-man show. Mantee must hold the audience's interest on his
own for a good 70 or 80 minutes. He does so easily. He brings just the
right mixture of tough-guy ingenuity and vulnerability to the part.Of course, part of the enjoyment of watching the film at this point in
time is that much of it is unintentionally funny. There are some
strange editorial corrections, such as the overdubbed ""15 Days"" when
Draper is making an accounting of his supplies. We are treated to
ridiculously bad spaceship animation. There are odd floating fireballs
when Draper first touches down. There isn't much effort in many shots
to keep the settings looking like Mars. There is one scene with Ed
Wood-style changes back and forth from night to day. And so on.On the other hand, if we look at the film as residing more in a realm
of surrealism, elements such as the floating fireballs are actually
pretty cool, and much of the cinematography and settings are excellent.
The exteriors were primarily shot in Death Valley National Park, and it
is beautifully captivating here. Also, some of the attempts to make the
exteriors look more Mars like are actually gorgeous. We get purple and
blue rockscapes against smoky skies, and we often see nice nods to
classic sci-fi illustrators such as Frank R. Paul (whose work often
graced the covers of fiction magazines like Amazing Stories) in
features such as bright red skies. Haskin also has a few moments of
effective ingenuity, such as a crucial plot point appearing as video
that Draper took and watched later. Plus, some of the film is
intentionally funny--my favorite instance being the line, ""Mr. Echo, go
to hell!"" The biggest flaw in my eyes is that the ending seems a bit rushed. A
lot happens in the last ten minutes or so of the film, without the
suspense it could have had with a longer running time. Despite the
flaws, however, this is worth a watch by serious fans of classic
sci-fi, and it's interesting to note influences films like this have
had on later-generation works in the same vein, such as Red Planet
(2000).",110,1964

He hijacks and holds them hostage on an odyssey into hell. We follow them
deeper and deeper into the beautiful, but hostile desert as Tallman seems to
outwit the authorities time and again. They become more and more terrified
as he becomes more and more psycho. He displays a kind of pure malice and
cruelty that makes your skin crawl. Example: He forces one of the buddies

the captives to guess whether he is awake or asleep. They guess wrong - he
kills them. The viewer takes this trip across the desert with them, all the
way to their final destination, and the climax of this exciting film. It is
easy to see why Ida Lupino, was considered one of the premier film noir
directors. Her concept of the fishing buddies, courageous, proud, but
terrified reaches right down into our guts. But it is her balanced vision
of the evil, intelligent, unpredictable killer that defines the film. This

distinct categories: big budget English language blockbusters like
""Hellboy"" and ""Pacific Rim"" and lesser known, low budget Spanish
language horror films like ""Devil's Backbone"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"".
His latest film, ""Crimson Peak"" is what happens when these two worlds
collide, in other words, a big budget English language horror film.""Crimson Peak"" is set in the late 19th century, first in New York, then
in rural England. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a young budding
writer who is intelligent, beautiful, and strong willed, refusing to
allow Victorian sensibilities dictate what she can and cannot do, and
as a result butts heads with those around her. Thomas Sharpe (Tom
Hiddleston) is an English aristocrat and inventor who is in New York
seeking financial backing for his mechanized clay mining business back
home. When tragedy strikes, Thomas marries Edith and brings her to his
home, Allerdale Hall in Cumberland, where his sister Lucille Sharpe
(Jessica Chastain) is waiting. As Edith tries to fit into her new
surroundings, she discovers that secrets abound and nothing is as it
seems.The visuals in ""Crimson Peak"" are so glorious, they are almost
overwhelming. The sets are spectacular visions of beauty and decadence
in decay; costumes are intricately detailed and gorgeous; the lighting
and over saturated color bring depth and meaning; the ghosts are
grotesquely beautiful; and, of course, the del Toro trademarks of
insects and clockwork gracefully found their way into the story as
well.Because ""Crimson Peak"" is a rather large studio production, it is being
marketed to a large audience. I believe this accounts for some of the

decided to see the film again today. Yes the film is very dark ,
extremely disturbing and unsettling. it has been called a black comedy
or darkly humorous etc. All the plethora of adjectives are in the same
vein which makes me feel that most people don't really ""get "" this
film. It has also been described as a story with a corny and
predictable ending which , for me , is the complete opposite. I have
rarely seen a film of such rare beauty and ingenuity. By the end of it
, i was moved to tears. I don't want to describe scenes ,
cinematography or performances. If this is the only review you read , i
would strongly urge everyone above the age of consent to see this
extremely powerful and inspiring film. Prepare yourself for scenes of
cruelty , humiliation , sexual abuse and psychological horror...there
are some truly disturbing scenes. But take them for what they are
without judgement, see how they complement the story and Bubby's
evolution and enjoy the ride. If you enjoyed Forrest Gump ( or more to
the point , Tom Hanks), Then this is the adult version. It doesn't
assault your heart strings the way Hollywood tries to do. A much
underrated and for me a very moving experience.",114,1993

but this little-known thriller from Australia may just be the most
unique of them all.Nurse comes under the spell of her seemingly comatose patient, whose
intense psychic powers are menacing the people around her.Patrick is a bizarre, yet oddly moving film that benefits strongly from
its off-beat and ultimately unpredictable story. It's a tale that
manages to side-step clichés to become not only a brooding chiller, but
a weird love story as well. There's an occasional good bit of suspense
and shock that keeps the tension high. The story also possesses a
strange sense of the erotic. Granted, the plot is a bit slow in pace
but Richard Franklin's direction and a good cast help to carry it well.Star Susan Penhaligon does a throughly good performance as the films
heroine/victim. Rod Mulliner is good as Penhaligon's troubled husband,
as is Bruce Barry as her boyfriend. Robert Thompson is also a stand-out
as the films menacing title character. Even though Thompson spends most
of the film lying in silence he still conveys a threatening presence,
he's just that good of an actor.For those seeking a left-field thriller that's thoughtfully well done,

695,10.0,6.7,"There should be a sub-genre in thrilling writing about the stories
where somebody stumbles, accidentally, into witnessing a major crime
but the perpetrator keeps countering each move with one of his or her
own. The reviews on this thread keep referring to Hitchcock's REAR
WINDOW, which certainly is the best known version of this plot, except
for one element that is not in that film until very late. A better film
to compare WITNESS TO MURDER to is actually THE WINDOW with Bobby
Driscoll, Arthur Kennedy, and Paul Stewart.Difference between WITNESS and REAR WINDOW, of course, is that in the
latter film Raymond Burr is unaware of why he is the center of so much
attention by the police until he sees Grace Kelly's gesture regarding
his wife's ring and the only person who can see it is Jimmy Stewart
across the courtyard of the apartment buildings. Then he realizes who
has been tipping the cops off about him. But that is about ten minutes
before the end of the film.The situation in WITNESS TO MURDER is almost identical to THE WINDOW.
Barbara Stanwyck happens to see a woman being strangled in an apartment
near her's by George Sanders. But Sanders (like Paul Stewart in THE
WINDOW, notices her and prepares accordingly. He (like Stewart) has
nothing to hide when the police (Gary Merrill and Jesse White) show up.
He is soon analyzing Stanwyck for them as a neurotic spinster who
hallucinates. And he is quite convincing.The difference between Sanders and Paul Stewart in their comparative
film parts is that Stewart killed his victim in an argument over
business (Sanders was in a sexual rage). Moreover, whatever one thinks
of Stewart's glib and careful killer, he is not getting deeper and
deeper into crime out of any political or intellectual views. Put
another way: if Bobby Driscoll had not witnessed what happened, but was
sound asleep (and Stewart was sure of it), Stewart would have hidden
the dead body somewhere, and he and Ruth Roman would have packed up and
moved to another city. Roman's loyalty to him would have reassured that
there wouldn't have been any problems on that end.But with Sanders he approaches the situation from a ""spiritual"" side
that Stewart would have found incomprehensible. We learn (and it is a
point that Merrill finds odd and troubling) that this suave, courteous,
and intellectual man is a defender of Nietzche's ""superman"" theories
(as twisted by the Nazis) and apologist for the policies of the Nazis
in several books. His treatment of his initial victim, and his subtle
and continuous persecution of Stanwyck are of a piece (he does not
believe such inferior types should threaten him). Towards the end he
even intends to make her death appear to be a suicide. Stewart felt
Driscoll was a viable threat to his freedom and security, but he never
has a speech suggesting the boy was a biological inferior.WITNESS TO MURDER is a good thriller, but it is not one of the all time
great ones. Still it is a worthy picture, the only one where Stanwyck
and Sanders appeared in together. So I give it a ""7"" on the scale,
recommending it as an interesting version of the hunted turned hunter
genre of thriller.",83,1954

expectations from what I read on IMDb. The movie does a pretty good job
of building suspense through a series of unfortunate events that seem
plausible. I found the main actor to be pretty decent and likable,
which is important because he's in 90% of the movie. The supporting
characters aren't given much film time but that's OK given the nature
of the film.A big bonus of the film for me was getting to see the exotic locations
of Laos. I like films that can take me to another part of the world and
immerse me in the culture of that area. This movie did a great job of

699,7.0,5.8,"There's a couple of stories (possibly apocryphal) about how Cannon's
career was launched, one story is that respected film Director Alan
Parker, saw a short film he made on a BBC amateur film-making programme
and, impressed with what he saw, immediately phoned the BBC so he could
get in touch with Cannon - which he apparently did, Parker then
supposedly recommended him to a prestigious film school...The other story is that Danny Cannon's father is a top studio executive
and that nepotism was the way he started.Either way, Cannon's debut film was an interesting little movie with
big aspirations - at the time British films tended to be almost always
socio-political, so-called worthy films, usually about the social
underclass - remember this was 1993 and just before Richard Curtis
invented the Britsh Rom-Com...What the film lacks in terms of story (Cannon was Co-Writer) it makes
up for in sheer film-making skill - The Young Americans is a
beautiful-looking movie.It's a film that belies it's VERY low-budget, and looks like a much
more expensive piece.Danny Cannon displays an almost Ridley Scott like style in the care he
takes with the look of the film, and the careful, unhurried pacing, he
is aided in his efforts by excellent Anamorphic 2.35:1 photography from
D.P. Vernon Layton - giving The Young Americans a rich, almost
sumptuous look, for what, on the surface, is a gritty urban crime
thriller.A special mention should be made for Composer David Arnold and his
beautiful, almost tragic Music Score - of course he went on to bigger
things: Stargate, Independence Day, the Bond movies - Tomorrow Never
Dies, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day, plus Zoolander,
Changing Lanes, The Stepford Wives and the upcoming Ghost Rider, and
another Bond - Casino Royale.Personally, I thought Danny Cannon's career might have amounted to
something more substantial that just 3 feature films.These films include the badly mis-judged(!) Stallone vehicle Judge
Dredd and the horror sequel I Still Know What You Did Last Summer - not
sure how the latter film fared at the box-office (though I suspect not
good!) I DO know that Judge Dredd was a BIG financial and critical failure -
Cannon got the film right after The Young Americans, tiny budget to
mega budget - could this be a case of Cannon running before he could
walk? Of course Danny Cannon has found considerable success as an
Executive/Supervising Producer, occasional Writer and sometimes
Director on the 3 hit CSI TV series from Jerry Bruckhiemer - this in
itself is no mean feat, but I do feel Cannon's potential as a Director
of Feature Films has gone largely untapped and that he could have made
a more substantial career if he'd stayed in Movies.Hear he's got a Soccer movie in the works, let's hopes that this is a
return to features for an underrated and talented Director.Lata.",0,1993
700,4.75,8.0,"""Tiny Giants 3D"" is a 44-minute documentary from 2014, so two years old
the day I write it, and it can still be defined as a short film. The
director and writer here is Mark Brownlow and he made this film
together with his regular helper, Emmy nominee Michael Gunton. Maybe
you wonder why I used the "" in the title of my review and the
explanation is that this is a very fictitious little tale of a chipmunk
and a small mouse. You will learn nothing new probably if you have seen
animal documentaries in the past, but that's not a problem at all as
this one may lack in terms of how informative it is, but it does
deliver from the story-telling perspective and also absolutely in terms
of the visual side. It is another great British production by BBC and
they have certainly delivered in recent years in terms of animal and
nature documentaries. The narrator is Stephen Fry and I am a great fan
of him which got me even more curious about this one. I believe this is
also a pretty good watch for young audiences as they are the ones who
will probably still learn a bit from it. And it's not too serious or
dramatic for them as our two heroes always make it out alive and they
even fight a very brave fight against a scorpion (the villain) at one
point. I enjoyed the watch, but I may be a bit biased because of how
much I like Fry and animal documentaries and because of how undeniably
cute the two animals in the main roles are. But one cannot deny that
this is a creative achievement from several genre directions.

701,11.2,6.7,"Surveying the wreckage of numerous other such films - burdened at their
outset with flimsy premises, one-dimensional characters, stale gimmicks
that coast on the fumes of pop cultural trends, and implausible
""meet-cute"" situations - which could not be sustained even with
big-name talent, inestimable budgets, and plague-like advertising
campaigns, I was understandably sceptical as to how the ""romantic
comedy"" aspect of this film might play out when I first sat down to
watch it. In retrospect, I honestly couldn't have been more pleased.
Rare indeed is the occasion when I have walked out of a theatre feeling
unambiguously good about what I saw, believing that it was well worth
the time and money I spent to watch it.The story forming the basis of ""Starter for 10"" is handled with a great
deal of humour, sensitivity, and intelligence. At no time did any part
of it feel forced or contrived, nor was it condescending. Testament to
this film's openness and accessibility, the emotional connection that I
formed with the primary character (James MacEvoy - may he have a long
and distinguished career ahead of him) was subtly cultivated
throughout, reinforced by simple - yet heartachingly truthful - moments
of confusion, awkwardness, uncertainty, and disappointment of the kind
anyone might experience (and probably has) in similar circumstances.
""Starter for 10"" masterfully captures the spirit of that time in one's
life wherein a person fully enters the world and begins to establish
her- or himself as an individual.So often, and unfortunately, it is the case that I see people on the
screen with whom I cannot identify, in situations to which I cannot
relate (this is typically due in part to the performers' overblown
celebrity status and the general ""Hollywood"" gloss that is spread
thickly over the top of everything). Not so where ""Starter for 10"" is
concerned. Perhaps it's no coincidence that ""Starter for 10"" references ""The
Graduate,"" since I believe it shall, in time, prove itself a worthy
descendant of that film's legacy and subsequently receive the higher
profile that it deserves.",92,2006

treasures of the black community of Harlem and tried to capitalize in
that world. Andy Garcia plays Lucky Luciano, an Italian man who also
was instrumental in the criminal activities one sees in the film.Also in the cast, Vanessa Williams, Cicely Tyson, Loretta Devine,

it. James Belushi (K-9, Race the Sun) and the late Tupac Shakur

kill the guy they sold it to, take the drugs & money, and label the crime as
gang related. This has worked for the first ten times, but the 11th
doesn't. The 11th guy they killed, turned out to be an undercover cop. So
the two are put in charge of finding the killer. So knowing that they
themselves killed him and could be in huge trouble, they begin to look for
possible candidates to take the fall. Eventually they decide on a homeless
man, wonderfully played by an unrecognizable Dennis Quaid (Switchback,
Dragonheart). They then get Belushi's girlfriend and stripper, Lela Rochon
(Waiting to Exhale, The Chamber) to testify against him. Soon though things
don't work out as Rochon starts to lose confidence and more evidence comes
out about the mysterious homeless man. Belushi and Shakur start to lose
their trust and confidence with each other. This is a well-written film
with some great dialogue and an awesome ending. James Belushi is great as
the mastermind behind the plot and the one who won't give up. Tupac Shakur
is just as good (in his final role) as the partner who has at least some
sort of a conscience. Rochon is good. Fine support work is turned in by
James Earl Jones and David Paymer as Quaid's lawyers. I highly recommend
this movie.

Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court, and Anita Hill's accusations
that Thomas had sexually harassed her on numerous occasions and was
morally unfit to become a justice. Various issues are explored,
including sexual harassment in the workplace, sexual harassment by an
African American in the workplace, and sexual harassment by an African
American male directed toward an African American female in the
workplace. If there is a villain in the piece, it is neither Anita Hill
nor Clarence Thomas (beautifully portrayed by Kerry Washington and
Wendell Pierce respectively), but the Democratic chairman, Joe Biden
(Greg Kinnear), of the Senate committee debating Thomas's
qualifications. From start to finish Biden is presented as a wuss,
easily swayed and manipulated by Republicans to present Thomas in the
best possible light. Along the way, Biden also loses witnesses to
affirm Clarence Thomas's alleged behavior toward Anita and other women.
The movie confronts the cowardliness of liberal white men (all the
Democrats on the committee) dealing with sexual harassment charges that
concern a black man, with the possible exception of the late-blooming
Edward Kennedy who finally comes to Anita Hill's defense. For the most
part, Republicans have a field day in attempting to destroy Anita
Hill's reputation with bogus charges while Democrats remain mute. Greg
Kinnear is completely credible as Biden as is Treat Williams as Ted
Kennedy. The movie stresses how this confirmation hearing resulted in
the country's growing sensitivity to sexual harassment. But it also
shows how Joe Biden's ineptness results not only in Clarence Thomas's
confirmation, but a generation of conservative opinions from the
Supreme Court.",110,2016

714,3.0,5.2,"I would like to stress at the outset that Puerto Ricans in Paris is not
a good movie. If you take only one thing from this review, it must be
this. I'm going to say some things in the paragraphs that follow -- I
may even say I enjoyed it -- but let there be no uncertainty. Movie.
Not good. Okay.So here's the rub. There's a certain primal pleasure in watching a film
like Puerto Ricans in Paris, an unabashed B-movie buddy comedy that
knows what it wants to be, aspires to nothing more, and delivers just
about what you'd expect. Granted, it's abysmally weak by ordinary
standards, but let's be realistic -- you won't wander into this one
expecting Fellini. From those to whom little is given, little is
required. Or something.The title pretty much sums up the premise, but here goes: Luis Guzman
and Edgar Garcia play two NYPD detectives working the counterfeit
luxury goods beat. When a Parisian arrives with a special request --
help a famous designer (Alice Taglioni) find a missing prototype
handbag worth millions -- the pair jets off to Paris (macarons, bro?)
and vapid screwball comedy ensues.I enjoyed the early promise of the counterfeit luxury goods angle,
since I recently read Deluxe: How Luxury Lost its Luster -- and a
surprising number of details in this film actually ring true: like a
corporate heavy ousting a designer to profit from her name, and the
faithful portrayal of Canal Street merchants and their backroom dens.
That said, I haven't the faintest idea why this luxury-goods storyline
was paired with overt Puerto Rican ethnic humor -- it's as though two
separate spec scripts were shuffled together and promptly green-lit.
Not that it matters much, since the luxury angle fades into the
background right quick.The Parisian storyline is simplistic and frankly not too important, a
basic whodunnit in which even the filmmakers regularly lose interest.
Guzman and Garcia go through the motions of screening various suspects
(often donning ethnic disguises, because easy laughs) and in the
meantime chastise one another, have heart-to-hearts about the meaning
of family, and so on. Characters come and go; some story lines are left
unfinished.The protagonists are simplistic and one-dimensional, but likable
nonetheless. Guzman is the ladies' man of the pair, a perpetual
bachelor and womanizer -- a role that's frankly hard to take very
seriously given that he's not exactly George Clooney yet he's slinging
more game than a Spiderman reboot on some very young, very attractive
French women. (To be fair, he has limited success -- his shlubby
appearance paired with aspirational macking could've been a punchline
here, but I don't think it was.) Garcia by contrast is married with
kids, and we taste his workaday struggles when his wife (Rosie Perez)
laments yet another unobserved anniversary. In Paris, Garcia's
loyalties are tested when the beautiful designer takes an interest in
him -- but the film stops short of ever causing Garcia a real problem
in this regard. (One senses that family and loyalty are particularly
sacrosanct here -- we mine Garcia's plight for gentle laughs, but never
place him anywhere near risk of actual infidelity.) Secondary
characters are double-thick stereotypes. Yes, this is ground-floor,
feel-good xenophobic comedy for Trump Nation.This movie struggles to strike the right rhythm with its
two-fish-out-of-water premise. And we're never really sure if Guzman
and Garcia are bumbling or actually on their game. Director Ian Edelman
also does his best to reinforce an American tourist's fantasy of Paris,
all gleaming cobblestones and streetlamps and whimsical bicycles and
fancy hotels and baguettes and Eiffels and romance. (The less that's
said about this, the better.)Production quality isn't great. Much of the film looks like it was shot
on an iPhone 6 and with about the same budget. The end credits would
have benefited from an undergrad intern, ten minutes, and a free trial
of Final Cut Pro. Puerto Ricans in Paris is, however, mercifully short,
clocking in at just over 1 hour 20 minutes.But all that said, and perhaps in spite of myself, I still enjoyed this
movie. Puerto Ricans in Paris is just wholly unpretentious. This is
real, working-man authenticity in film form. I mean, look at the title.

716,3.0,6.3,"Comedy is subjective. Trying to explain why something does or doesn't
make you laugh is like trying to explain why you think certain foods
are delicious; how do you make someone experience your experience? For
example, the sketch show ""Key & Peele"", while often a smart satire on
race and sex, was simply and inexplicably hilarious to me. On the other
hand, Keanu, a film created and starring the same dudes, has (arguably)
nowhere near the laughs. Despite some all-in comedic performances from
two of the most talented guys around, it simply isn't very funny.
Through a series of unfortunate events, two mild-mannered men go
looking for a kitten and find themselves in the midst of a war between
competing drug gangs. Key and Peele display the same
comedy-in-sync-ness they became famous for, and they deserve a vehicle
much better than this to display their skill. Unfortunately the movie
itself never quite finds its balance. It's an absurdist comedy that
feels both too absurd and not absurd enough. The plot is shoddy at
best, and the shallow levels of character give way to whatever joke
seems to be funniest at that moment. None of that would matter, of
course, if I just found the movie more consistently funny. Not that
it's devoid LOL moments; Key and Peele both have a knack for putting a
twist on a line or a facial expression to give it an added layer of wit
(i.e. how they act when they think they're about to be killed).
Unfortunately, they have created such anticipation through years of
brilliant TV work, anything less than wall-to-wall guffaws can be a

Monster"" deals with a radioactive element that gains energy from
appliances surrounding it and will not stop doubling in size. As you
can tell, this is one of the more intellectual concepts for a b-movie
of the time. It's certainly not ""2001"", but its quite refreshing to see
a scientifically accurate film from a period not exactly renowned for
such. The concept and jargon used (not to mention the lack of any real
monster) is probably what spelled doom for this film. If you are a fan
of vintage science fiction short stories from the 40s and 50s, seeking
this rarity out is recommended as it captures the atmosphere of a good
""Amazing Stories"" magazine.The film itself is far from flawless. The comic relief characters are
unfunny and generally annoying, but fortunately sparse. The stock
footage from a German film entitled ""Gold"" is certainly fascinating,
but slightly erroneous. The twist of one of the characters going insane
towards the end seems to be only an excuse to pad out time by using
more footage.On the other hand, there are many positive aspects which make me wish
this film was more fondly remembered. Richard Carlson was always a fine
leading man, intelligent and likable. Its a shame he never got any
major roles outside of drive-in flicks. And as I stated above, the
screenplay is one of the most intelligent and scientifically accurate
of the period. If this one pops up on TV you may as well check it out.

quirky Tarantino hit-man, super-cool Shaft, or borderline psycho
soldier. In TLKG, Jackson is the everyman we identify with. The poor
schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy woman's odyssey to uncover the
dangerous secret of her past.Though the story claims that Davis's character, Samantha Caine is
suffering from amnesia, the writer and director treat her condition as
if it were a multiple personality disorder.Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac Charly
Baltimore -- she is a separate, fully-developed personality. The
traumas suffered by Samantha in the first half-hour of the movie help
the submerged dissociate personality of Charly to emerge again.The materials of her past life excavated by Jackson's detective Mitch
Henessey facilitate Charly's resurfacing. Good timing, too, considering
the target Samantha makes of herself.But Charly has to fight herself to remain the dominant personality. One
gathers from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality (Charly)
developed after her father died and she was recruited by the ""Chapter"".In the eight years Charly was buried in the psyche, though, her
Samantha identity developed into the dominant personality. (She's even
funnier that Charly.) This was probably due to becoming a mother,
because it's the reunion with her daughter that breaks Charly's
struggle to suppress Samantha, leading to their apparent integration by
movie's end.It's impossible to choose a ""best quote"" from this film:""Now you're a sharpshooter?""""I saved your ass. It was great!""""Continue dying. Out.""""I sock 'em in the jaw and yell 'Pop goes the weasel'"".And a couple of dozen more, many too raunchy to quote here.Geena Davis looks great, and comes off as an action hero without
glossing over the fact she's turning forty. (Listen to Charley's
history, do the math).Fantastic soundtrack, too. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle,
Marvin Gaye. I give 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' a 9, only because I don't believe in a
perfect 10. Seen it a dozen times, and it still stays fresh. Nice
twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to 'It's A Wonderful
Life.'",121,1996
719,14.0,5.1,"I'm one of those who loves old horror films especially the one's from
England which have their own unique style but let's face it, not all of
them were top notch efforts and I think this clearly is one of those
despite it's sincerity. Story is set in Victorian England where bodies
have been piling up completely drained of blood and Police Inspector
Quennell (Peter Cushing) has taken over the case. He also notices that
the bodies have strange wounds about the face and this leads him to
believe that some sort of flying beast is what's causing their deaths.*****SPOILER ALERT*****What Inspector Quennell doesn't know is that his acquaintance Dr. Karl
Mallinger (Robert Flemyng) who's an entomologist has somehow
transformed his daughter Clare (Wanda Ventham) into a half human/half
moth creature that feeds on blood. Clare has the ability to turn into
this beast anytime she feels but she wants a male mate and her father
has been very busy trying to bring to life another vampiric Deathshead
moth but when he feels that Quennell's investigation has brought him
too close they pack up and leave. Inspector Quennell tracks down Clare
and Dr. Mallinger to another town but hasn't figured out exactly where
they are living until his daughter Meg starts acting strange and when
another body pops up this points him in the right direction to end
everything!This less than spectacular effort was directed by veteran Vernon Sewell
who was no spring chicken in 1968 and would end up directing only one
more film after this but one has to wonder if his age or the reception
this film had that prompted that. Hammer Studios was so successful
during the 1960's that it led to other studios being created such as
Tigon Productions which made this film but it never had any huge hits
and went kaput in the early 1970's. One of the big reasons (if not the
entire reason) that this film fails to be suspenseful is because of the
poor special effects which has Ventham in her moth form appearing in an
outfit no different than the one that Susan Cabot wore in ""The Wasp
Woman"" and I never could understand how these creatures could morph
into another life form and have their clothes disappear! Wouldn't they
be monsters wearing the same clothes like Lon Chaney Jr. did in ""The
Wolf Man""? I also noticed a few other things that may or may not
interest anyone (but...who cares?) like the scene where the morgue
attendant (played by creepy Roy Hudd) is having dinner on a slab with a
body and if you look closely you'll see the cadavers foot move more
than once. I also never did fully understand the reason Dr. Mallinger's
scarred servant was so mean to the birds that were kept and for what
purpose his death meant but I'm guessing it was to just keep him
quiet...for good! It's also safe to say that Billy the bug catcher
isn't going to be getting laid anytime soon because it appeared that
the bleary eyed Meg was actually interested in him but all he wanted to
do was kill bugs. He's about ""THAT CLOSE"" from being Renfield! The
ending also hurts this film and it's hard to believe that some giant
moth-creature would just fly into some fire and be killed after being
intelligent enough to lure victims to secluded areas. If your a fan of
English horror films (like myself) than you'll find this watchable and
a good reason for that is the casting of Cushing who's mere presence
raises this from junk to passable entertainment. I am recommending this
because true horror film fans will find enough here to keep them
interested and I have to admit that I'm one of those who's a sucker for
these types of films even if it's not from Hammer.",88,1968

preferences and I have a passion for European art house pretentious
stuff, so when Fright Night was recommended to me I dismissed it in a
snobby ""80s special effects vampire horror movie? A title that rhymes?
No, thank you!"" kind of way.HOWEVER, I have a feeling it may be the single best film I have ever
seen, of any genre or time period. It has a witty script, fabulous
special effects and some of the best acting I have seen, particularly
Evil Ed later on in the film. There are moments of suspense, hilarity,
tenderness (for example with Peter Vincent and the dying wolf) and
believable every day life. This film didn't actually scare me but it
did make me laugh very very hard.A special mention must be made of Chris Sarandon as I think his
performance really stood out. Evil is not as easy to portray in stories
as people think, but Sarandon does the most believable evilness I think
I have ever seen, coupled irresistibly with the sexiest seduction scene
ever (is it wrong that I wanted him to win in the end because he was so
gorgeous?). If vampires really did exist, I think they would be exactly
like Jerry Dandridge, except maybe without the same scary 80s vampire

721,11.0,0.0,"So as the Title suggests this is an Anthology of ""Horror"" based around
""Holidays"". Erm, now the struggle to actually write something about it.
Well, first off, the majority of the segments aren't ""Holidays"", more
""Celebratory occasions"". Secondly, don't waste your time watching this.The majority of them seemed more like a teaser or trailer for Films,
rather than complete stories as there was no real conclusion to the
majority of them, they were left somewhat ambiguous in nature. I
apologise for the tone of this review but i'm not long finished
watching this and i'm honestly left wondering if what i watched was
some kind of April Fools joke or if it was a genuine attempt at an
Anthology type Film.First we had an odd segment about Valentines day and a loner girl who
had a crush on her PE Teacher. More of a teaser than anything, it
seemed extremely amateurish.There then followed segments on St Patricks day, snakes and pregnancy
with an attempt at humour. then a poorly scripted and even worse
segment about Easter and some Hybrid of the Easter Bunny and Jesus....
Then some women who get Pregnant every time she has sex, insisting her
Boyfriend wears 2 or even 3 condoms. I think by this point i'd all but
given up on it to be honest.One on fathers day came next...Erm, yeah. Just don't bother with this
Film, honestly. I can't think of anything positive to say about it.
It's almost as though a Film Studio had a spare £100 sitting about and
decided to make an Anthology. it's that bad and that cheap. If you like
absolute garbage then by all means knock yourself out and watch this

something enjoyable.This is beyond a shadow of a doubt in the worst 5 Films i've ever

recently where it screened out of competition. Being a Woody Allen fan,
I was just hoping the film would be OK and not a disaster like some of
his most recent films. Boy, was I surprised! MATCH POINT is easily his
best film since CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS and once of his best ever. In
his first foray out of Manhattan and into London, you would have
thought he had lived there all his life. This film is a masterpiece and
is a sure bet to win critical acclaim and many awards. Jonathan Rhys
Meyers is a revelation and finally lands a role of a lifetime as a
young man who enters the world of the wealthy elite and would do
anything to stay there. Scarlett Johansson has never looked as sultry
and sexy as she does here playing the cool femme fatale. The film is
beautifully structured and the performances by all and sundry are
exemplary. Emily Mortimer and Brian Cox stand out among the supporting
cast. The film has so many layers and so many unexpected twists that
this is obviously the work of a genius director in full flight.What can I say. The best way to see this film is without knowing too

film for one reason. Many critics have praised it and will continue to
do so. Many critics will write it off as ""just another washed-up
musician struggling to overcome their addictions and weaknesses and
make sense of things"", etc. In a way, they are right. In a way, this is
another one of those movies. But, because of Jeff Bridges' absolutely
amazing performance, this film is more than that. If you want to see an
actor breathe real-life into their character, endow truthful subtlety
in their part, and absolutely nail a role that they were born to play,
then you need to see Jeff Bridges rendition of Bad Blake. I believed
that Bridge's portrayal of ""The Dude"" in ""The Big Lebowski"" was the
essential role of his career, but after seeing this performance, I've
changed my tune. It's true that we will not be witnessing cinematic
history with the incredible plot or awe-inspiring film-making. However,

727,10.5,5.9,"In this 1941 Paramount film Fred Astaire has a new dancing partner in
Paulette Goddard. They actually dance a number together. The ads read,

this story about two musicians, Astaire and Burgess Meredith, who try
vainly

""She's a lovely girl, with a breathtaking figure, who couldn't dance and
somehow resisted every attempt to break down her handicap.""They filmed it just once. Just one take. Goddard said she could never go
through it again. Unusual, also, for Astaire to do only one take to any
number he was in. He was always a task master at perfecting his dances.

good.Interesting note that Goddard's other male lead was Burgess Meredith, whom
she went on to marry years later as she was still married at the time to
Charlie Chaplin.",84,1940
728,10.5,7.2,"The film is so engaging that you manage to overlook the flaws while
you're watching it. Sure some of the acting and editing are below par,
but you don't realize that fact until after the film is done. During
viewing you get caught up with the story, and Hillgoss' performance.
Mary didn't have to be multi-dimension, but Hillgoss' performance makes
her so. She is cold, alone, and isolated from the world. She has no
friends, and doesn't feel the need for any. Despite the coldness of her
character, you feel sympathetic for her and even begin to hope she gets
out okay. Due to her lack of companionship, she eventually turns to the
chauvinistic man who lives across from her. This is another interesting
character, one who obviously lusts for Mary but doesn't know how to
express his feelings, and it seems if it wasn't for the censorship at
the time, he could've become more fleshed out. As another reviewer
noted, he is obviously on the verge of rape and is emotionally abusive.The story is simple, yet it grabs you by the throat and refuses to give
up until the film is over. A woman bizarrely comes out of water three
hours after an accident occurred. How did this happen? As she tries to
get away as far as possible from the incident, strange events
continuously occur and she finds herself drawn mysteriously to an
abandoned carnival. Also, a strange specter appears constantly. Is this
a human stalking Mary? Or is it something supernatural or of the
psyche? No one else can see him. Things continue to get worse and
worse, and many times Mary is unable to communicate or hear the people
around her, yet strangely it goes back to normal within moments. The
film's ending is slightly predictable, but suiting. Something more
flashy would've destroyed the feel.As many have noted, this isn't a technically flawless film. But you get
so sucked in by the film it isn't until the ending that you realize
some of the flaws. For one the editing isn't the greatest, but you must
remember that the crew had an obscenely low budget to work with. It
wasn't for lack of talent, it was for lack of resources. Also some of
the supporting actors aren't very good, but again the film is so
low-budget that it would've been impossible to pay better performers.
Did you really expect to see Oscar winners in a b-film anyways? There
are several aspects that easily trump the mild flaws. For one, the
camera work is incredible, on par with many Hollywood films. The angles
of the organ were particularly affecting, and the upward shots of the
ghouls gave you the feeling of helplessness that Mary feels. Also,
Hillgoss' performance is, as I stated above, very good. She manages to
make a cold and isolated character human and sympathetic instead of the
cardboard stereotype that haunts most films of the nature. The actor
who plays the neighbor isn't the best, but his character is certainly
interesting, a perverted peeping tom that if the film had been made ten
years later would've surely been more developed. Also, the crudeness of
the acting adds to the feel. Due in fact that Hillgoss provides the
only good acting in the film, you get the feeling that something isn't
right. The lack of development for almost every other character adds to
the dreamlike quality. When was the last time you had a nightmare in
which the other people involved where fleshed out.The most impressive aspect is Harvey's direction. He knew how to make
something out of absolutely nothing, and it certainly shows. The angles
and pacing are some of the film's benefactors. And the dream sequences
and sped-up carnival footage are nothing short of breathtaking, showing
his masterful Harvey was. It's a shame he never made another film, but
than again if you make only one film, why not have it be a masterpiece?
""Carnival of Souls"" transcends its limitations. It contains no special
effects for the most part, and very minimalist makeup. It shows that
imagination is what makes a film work, not flashy dynamics and special
effects. Due to this, many fans of newer horror films will not
appreciate its genius. For fans of cult films and surrealist films will
be impressed. The latter camp will be amazed how the film is very
avant-garde despite no budget to work with. The film is one of the
ultimate cult films. Ignored when it came out, only decades later was
it appreciated on its rerelase in 1989. The same thing happened with
""Reefer Madness"", ""Glen or Glenda"", and ""Spider Baby"". That is, in my
opinion, is one of the factors that makes a film a cult film,
definitely more so than if the film is just a sleeper hit. Even if it
didn't have the cult following, this is still a film that must be seen.
It never outright scares you, but it gets under your skin. It leaves a
lasting impression, and I guarantee you'll not forget it for the rest
of your life. (10/10)",78,1962

begins having flashbacks to the life of someone else -- a child
abductor who has never been caught. Can he put the pieces together and
solve the crime before the kidnapper abducts again? I have said in other reviews that Billy Zane really makes a movie. My
trust in that statement was fractured after seeing ""The Mad"" (though I
don't blame Zane), but once more restored after this picture. He
appears in practically every scene. While not the greatest film you'll
see (it has a very made-for-TV or straight-to-video feel about it), the
plot is interesting and the characters likable. Billy Zane, of course,
helps tremendously by being the evil twin of Ben Affleck.It also helps to have Dennis Hopper play Taylor's foster father Max
Lichtenstein, although his only purpose in this film is to show up at
random times with a few beers and cigars. Oh well, he's still better
here than he was in ""Land of the Dead"". ""Max,"" says Hopper, ""is a guy
whose wife has died and he's sort of coasting through life a bit like a
ghost. But it's a really warm relationship that he has with Taylor --
something genuine and real."" That's a good quote. And Hopper knows Max,
if the rumors are true, because he spent weeks studying his lines
despite being a relatively small character -- residents around town
would catch him in restaurants reading. Tricia Helfer was also pretty
decent, though not particularly noteworthy.This was a plot-driven film, to be sure. Rated R for ""language and
frightening images"", there's no nudity or gore here. The frightening
images, as far as I can tell, are just a person in a mask. Nothing
really disturbing. There's a photo album that may be thought as
disturbing by some. I thought it was deviously brilliant. The plot was excellent because it's not only a thriller but also a
mystery (a race against time to solve a child abduction case, while the
lead also must find how he's connected to the kidnapper). There's even
sub-mysteries (such as how the lead's girlfriend knows about the
kidnappings) that might leave you guessing. And random shout-out: nice
use of a cell phone as a flashlight. We've all been there.I give this film credit because I thought I had it figured out before
it was half over. My two guesses about certain plots were close, but
ultimately both wrong. There's a few twists you won't see coming. The
""big reveal"" is disappointing only if you're being overly critical, as
they sort of dump it all on you at once for no reason. But I thought it
was okay.I wouldn't have rented this film on my own, but having been asked to
review it, I'm glad I did. If you're scanning the new releases and find
this, you could do much worse. I saw it with two friends and we all
seemed to enjoy it, so it caters to a wider range than just myself. And

732,13.0,4.1,"I have to agree with the other, few, reviewers here....why this film
has barely a ""4"" rating is beyond me. It's about twice that good. Not
only is it an interesting story, the characters are well-drawn and
complex, the action is very well staged and performed, and even the
special effects are creepy and effective.Julian and John (Shane Dean and Slade Hall) are well-worn survivalists.
Their idea of a kick-ass weekend is to walk for a few days into Arizona
desert with nothing but a couple bottles of water. Julian seems to have
taken these treks a bit more seriously over the years, and balks when
John invites his younger loud-mouthed bud Paul (Cavin Gray Schneider)
along for their latest adventure into the Arizona Coconino (?) forest
(a new one on me, but a very cool location).There's good tension between them as Julian and Paul constantly
tear-down and one-up each other with John desperately trying to
referee. Much like ""Deliverance,"" however, the trio encounter an
unexpected turn of events that has them fighting for their lives for
two-thirds of the film.I'd never seen any of these actors before, and I was extremely
impressed with all of them, particularly Shane Dean's Julian, who takes
a role that could have easily been written off into crazy-ville and
instead makes it compelling and oddly tragic.What really blew me away were the dream and drug-infused (via peyote,
of course) sequences. For a low-budget movie, these were extremely
creepy and vividly rendered.The ending is chilling, and not easy to shake. The only minor quibble I
have with the film is many of the insider survivalist techniques.

to do so, given that Paul's character is a newbie.But this is a minor flaw in an otherwise trippy, tense experience.",98,2009
733,5.666666666666667,6.5,"When it comes to action movies, James Cameron is one of my favorite
directors. In particular, ""The Abyss"" and ""Terminator 2"" are two of my
all-time favorite movies. Like others, I'm disappointed to see that
since ""Titanic"" Cameron is only making documentaries and I'm looking
forward to see his ""Battle Angel"" (currently scheduled for a 2007
release), which will be his first feature in 10(!) years.I didn't really like ""Expedition: Bismarck"" and ""Ghosts of the Abyss"",
so my expectations from ""Aliens of the Deep"" weren't that high. Still,
I got disappointed. I watched the 95-min DVD version and felt like I
was watching a ""behind the scenes"" featurette of the real movie.The movie promises to show us ""aliens"" from the bottom of the sea. It
surprised me that during the entire duration, you don't get to see more
than 10 minutes of that - most of them are the same creatures. TV shows
like the excellent ""The Blue Planet (2001)"" by the BBC already gave us
all these creatures (and many others not shown here) in a MUCH clearer
view and better photography.Instead, this movie focuses on showing all the people and equipment
involved in making the dives. It was interesting in the first 10
minutes and it would have been alright if I wanted to know more about
the making of the movie. But it's not interesting to see Cameron and
crew for 95 minutes discussing how things should be made.Except for the few short computer animations in the movie, I got a
feeling that I was watching an unedited material. Cameron puts himself
and lots of people with Ph.D. in front of the camera, but he is more
interested in showing us them playing, making faces, modeling to the
cameras and having really shallow discussions instead of giving some
in-depth analysis of the subject.Most of the underwater dialog consists of ""Wow"" and ""That is amazing"".
The narration is horrible right from the beginning and the lowest point
- for me - was during the explanation how these creatures were first
discovered, which actually used the phrase: ""These scientists went like
'Wow!'"".Most of the underwater material shows the submarines and the people
instead of the creatures. Is it because they didn't find what they
wanted and didn't have enough material to shows us? When you finally
get to see some creatures, you have absolutely no explanations about
them. So many educated scientists around and you don't even get to know
the names of the creatures! You just watch it like you would if you
dived yourself. Cameron himself sums it pretty well in one scene, when
a beautiful jelly-like creature passes and he says ""I have no idea what
that is"". I don't blame you - you're not a scientist, but what are all
the people around for?Summing it all up - this movie was a big disappointment and boring
enough for me to fast-forward parts of it. If you want to see the
creatures promised here, see another documentary; if you want to see a
good Cameron project - go and watch any of his brilliant action movies.
But save yourself from watching this.",47,2005
734,9.4,5.8,"I have always been fascinated by the short and violent life of Alexander of
Macedonia, which of course makes me biased in reviewing this film. It has
been said of this film that Robert Rossen, who produced, wrote and directed
this film, was aiming for a masterpiece but failed honorably. While this is
true in a way, I still enjoyed it more than that.
This movie is not fast in pace, and the direction is not perfect either, but
it feels authentic. I'm sure that not everything portrayed is true to
history (does anyone really care?), but it is convincing, and the acting is
solid. Richard Burton is a very good Alexander, and he adds a lot of subtle
edges to this enigmatic figure from history (just ignore the silly blond
wig...) All in all, Alexander the Great is a good film, perhaps too
ambitious, and even though it is not very accessible to viewers not familiar
with the territory, it is still quite dramatic, convincing and enjoyable if
you like historical epics. And even though the film doesn't ask you to care
too much about the characters, it is still an interesting, intellectual, and
high minded story you probably will not forget. If you keep in mind that it

man, he complains about many things and is generally unapproachable.
One day he stumbles upon a series of hazardously unfortunate events
which lead him into awkward world of crime. This is a very distinct
style of comedy, which can be poignantly funny at times, but also
riddled with tons of profanity and can be even resentful, thus it
probably caters to more adult audience.Acting is sharply over-the-top as Barney wonders into sillier antics
than the last, involving his strange mom as well as detectives hell

for comedy, a bit similar to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, certainly not a light
watch for casual or younger audience, but for mature demographic the
oddities might be a treat.The cast performs with intense gusto and yelling, which is also one of
the movie's quirks. Its accent is very thick, when said in fast pace it
can be confusing, so subtitles would be helpful for this case. It can
be jarring when the movie tries to pull off a strangely dark tone,

bleak but engaging realism. The characters are developed and yet
refreshingly, we don't have to suffer too much relationship nonsense.The plot is pretty straight forward and while some might say it was a

Casper Navarro (Michael DeLorenzo), is in charge of the investigation,

the Mexican cult ""La Santa Muerte"" and has a promising beginning. The
cast has names like Paz Vega and Simon Baker in the lead roles and
Claire Forlani with a minor participation. Unfortunately the resolution

745,7.5,3.2,"I wholeheartedly agree with everything the reviewer SomeoneSomewhere
said about this film. There is no point to this movie. None whatsoever.
Let me start off by saying the first Invoking film was complete crap.
It didn't have a wide distribution and the few people that saw it hated
it. In fact, people on the IMDb page for the Invoking hated the movie
so badly that the last time I was on that page they were gleefully and
desperately trying to make the movie have the lowest rating on IMDb.
That says a lot because there is total crap out there. As far as the Invoking 1 and it's sequel, Invoking 2, are concerned,
both movies have much in common: terrible acting; annoying and
underdeveloped characters; lame villains; utterly lacking in anything
scary; the house on the movie cover for the Invoking 1 is nowhere in
the movie, and the same goes for Invoking 2, which also features a
house on the cover, which is nowhere in the movie; both movies have
titles trying to cash in on more popular horror flicks: Invoking one
was originally called Sader Ridge but changed to the Invoking to cash
in on the Conjuring's title, and Invoking 2's subtitle, ""Paranormal
Events"" was obviously created to cash in on Paranormal Activity's
title; and, last but not least, both movies are completely and utterly
pointless. I remember a Simpson's episode where Homer is put on a lie
detector. The law enforcement agent asks him, ""Homer, do you understand
the questions I'm about to ask you?"" Homer says, ""Yes,"" and the lie
detector explodes! That same type of thing would happen to me. If you
attached a lie detector to me and asked, ""I'll give you $1 million if
you can tell me what the point of the Invoking 1 and 2 were about. Can
you honestly tell me what the Invoking 1 and 2 were about?"" I'd say,
""Yes, I can tell you what they were about."" and the lie detector would
explode!Seriously. There is no point to either the beginning Invoking movie nor
the sequel. Neither of the movies brought anything new, interesting, or
innovative to the horror film genre at all. Not once. Furthermore, in
terms of story, they have nothing in common. You don't need to see the
Invoking 1 in order to understand the Invoking 2. The stories aren't
related at all. There aren't any actors in the sequel that were in the
first movie; the sequel makes no mention of the story in the first
movie; the stories were even set in a completely different location
than the first movie; and I you wouldn't know the movies were supposed
to be part of a series without the title. Regarding this sequel, Invoking 2, it's an anthology with 6 unrelated
stories. None of the stories are even 20 minutes long. In fact, 2 of
them are less than five minutes long. Plus, none of the stories is
fleshed out, nor do they feel like they were finished. There were a lot
of inconclusive and ambiguous elements in the story that made the
stories unsatisfying. I kept saying things like, ""Okay, what happened
to that guy? How come this woman doesn't have a back story?"" The
stories ended abruptly and I was left scratching my head and wondering
what is the point of telling a story that has no conclusion. What's
worse is that many of the stories were pretty predictable. I kept
saying things like, ""How much do you wanna bet that dude is gonna? How
much do you wanna bet that chick is gonna?"" and it always happened. It
is no fun watching a horror movie that features underdeveloped and
unlikable characters, zero scares, clichés, inconclusive story
elements, and predictability at almost every turn. Don't bother watching this. Even Scooby-Doo is scarier. There were a
few shots of mutilated bodies. But all the kills in every one of the
short films was off-screen. Plus, it sucks how this movie had
attractive women I thought would get naked (some of them even
disrobing) but the movie went the non-nude route with a lot of teasing
but no payoff. All in all, this anthology is 73 minutes long with boring shorts that
have no relation to each other whatsoever. If you ever decide to watch
this garbage, I'm 100% positive you'll be saying, ""I could make a
better movie than this even if I spent the entire shoot smoking weed
out of a Drano bottle."" IMDb please allow 0 star ratings.",83,2015

incredibly poor. Main actors were decades too old and obviously
overweight and out of condition to be remotely believable as active

portraying.Soldier ranks and chain of command was completely wrong for the
situation and even the most obvious military tactics such as securing a
perimeter, finding cover/laying prone during a firefight or trying to
avoid an obvious ambush were mostly ignored.Character development was nil and supporting women only served to annoy
the main characters without a hint of romantic interest or sex appeal

film. The audience was given little reason to care who won or lost and
there was no interesting subplot, character drama or anything all that
interesting to see in terms of actors, vehicles, aircraft or weapons.In spite of the cast including 7th Dan Aikido black belt Steven Seagal

altercation, only a series of lackluster gunfights.Some smaller problems the US weapons were obviously not government

lack of typical support weapons on both sides. Weapons usage was strange even for b-movies, most rifles were never
fired full-auto, characters seemed to have ample ammo but most fired
sparingly while the ""sniper"" was spraying everything in sight with
full-auto fire. Later no one remembered to reload a nearly empty M9
pistol before starting a new gunfight...the same M9 pistol which proved

it. One day she asked me if I wanted to see Barbershop: The Next Cut at
the dollar movies. I had overheard from a few acquaintances that it was
a decent movie, and I couldn't find anything more interesting showing
so I decided to see it with her. I had never seen any of the prior
Barbershops so I didn't know what to expect. I figured why not, I had
nothing better to do and thought maybe I would watch a decent movie and
get a few chuckles in. Boy oh boy was I asking for too much.Right away within the first two minutes I knew the kind of nonsense I
would have to sit through. It starts off talking about how awesome of a
president Barack Hussein Obama is, and how black people are oppressed
and blah blah blah (let it be known that I am not white. Sorry to
disappoint you race-card players). I figure, ""whatever, it won't last"",
but silly me. As the first few minutes played out, every liberal
progressive talking point gets thrown in my face so fast I feel like
I'm watching CNN. With horrendous acting, the illiterates working at
the barbershop (which is co-ed, because you can't forget ""gender
equality"") ramble on about how white man is so bad, and that the white
man is the reason for their failures and shortcomings and how they need
to take back power, how guns and cops are evil, black lives matter, and
how the gangster Michael Brown was a victim despite the fact that other
races are killed more frequently. I mean, people talk like Brown was
walking home from Med School when he was shot. The list goes on and on.
Amidst an argument among the illiterates about the tyrannical Caucasian
race, the token Middle Eastern of the diverse group says, ""Look guys, I
don't like white people either"". Can you imagine if a white person said
that about black people? But this is different so it gets a pass i
guess. There is no rhyme or reason to any of this stuff being brought
up other than to appeal to the brainwashed population that eats this
stuff up. The camera has an annoying tendency to make sure that the ""NO
GUNS ALLOWED"" sign is always clearly visible in the background, and
when our beloved protagonist Ice Cube apprehends a gun, he looks at it
like he never saw one before. I'm not even 15 minutes into the movie

of millionaire actors pretending to be oppressed and poor and crying
like victims, only to cash their million dollar checks and go back to
their lavish lifestyle.The movie at times will take a break from it's communist agenda (but
not really) to develop its plot, which is so hilariously sad that I
have every reason to believe that these script writers belong in strait
jackets. When two members of rival gangs have an altercation in the
barbershop, the illiterates decide that it's time to take action! Let's

to stop violence in the neighborhood? FREE HAIRCUTS! What better way to
stop bloods and crips from murdering each other than free haircuts?!

an action film from a first-person perspective using a GoPro Hero3
Black Edition camera. The proof of concept was released as ""Biting
Elbows: Bad Motherf***er"". It was pitched publicly and helped to
successfully crowd-fund the feature, 'Hardcore'.It's better to keep this short and sweet: the film is extraordinarily
violent; not for the squeamish. It has plenty of action, free-running,
stunts, and plenty of room for comedic elements. Even the opening
titles give you a taste of what's to come!Sharlto Copley (District 9, and other Neill Blomkamp projects) plays
the main POV's assistant throughout the film. Copley definitely gives a
range of character performances and is quality. Wearing many hats, he
guides you along as if you were needing assistance in a video game,
which, by the way, this film makes several references to. In
particular, the Chernobyl level in Call of Duty 4 with Capt.

lot of the free-running scenes are inspired by Mirror's Edge.For those who are wondering, no. You likely won't get dizzy watching a

sit in the front row. Otherwise, you will have a blast.'Hardcore' is an all-around fun time. Just be okay with the violence.

White fall deeply in love with the prince? She barely knows him. (3) Why
did
the huntsman decide not to kill Snow White? I doubt that her kindness had
an
effect on his decision. These are couple of questions I always had
pertaining to Snow White.
The movie version of the tale, which I found out recently is closer to the
original version, answers most my questions. The characters were more
realistic. The movie was a good mix of realism and fantasy. The movie isn't
really scary or gruesome, but it is supenseful and creepy. I liked the
change of the dwarfs. I would of liked the movie to go into more detail
about the relationship between the stepmother and Snow White. The twist
with
the love interest was good too. Also, Snow White in this movie has more
heart than in the Disney version. If this movie had a little bigger budget,
some good advertising, and people seriously backing it than it probably
would of been in the theaters around the same time as ""Ever

753,9.8,5.7,"It's strange, I wonder how this film would have been received if it was
directed by Spielberg instead of an unknown. Because this film is about
as intense as they come. Granted, it lacks in the personal
relationships and that is what made Jaws such the classic that it is.
We all know that there is no way a sequel to Jaws could ever live up to
what we experienced with Jaws, but this film is about as scary as they
come.Here, I must admit that the characters take a back seat to the shark.
But is that necessarily wrong? We have already seen the shark in the
first one so the mystery is gone, so now the only thing to do is make
sure the audience is scared out of their minds. And that I can assure
you is done with just as much perfection and attention to detail as the
original. Take for example the opening scene where two divers are looking in the
Orca ( Quint's sunken ship from the first film ). They are playfully
taking pictures in front of the sunken ship. Then suddenly, a shot from
behind them, and the ominous music. You know they are going to be
eaten, but the scene is done with so much tension and perfect pacing
that you are scared all over again. And when the shark finally does
strike, we experience that primal emotion all over again.The story is a fairly simple one but affective at the same time. Brody
( Roy Scheider ) is convinced there is another shark in the waters off
Amity and he is having a hard time convincing the town idiots that he
is right. But this time his two sons are a little older and they will
be involved in the final confrontation with the shark.There is one other scene that I wanted to point out and that is a scene
where a picture is being developed. Brody is given a camera of the
missing divers from the beginning. The developer then tells him that
the pictures are about to be processed. As he stands in the red room,
waiting for the pictures to develop, he knows. He has that feeling.
Something is going to show up on the picture. And sure enough we see
it. The mouth. The black, doll-like lifeless eye appears in the corner
of the frame and Brody knows. He knows what it is. This is such a
powerful scene in the film and it is directed with such skill that it
looks like it could have been directed by Spielberg. I think Jaws 2 is a great film and it is just as scary if not a little
scarier than the first, but what it lacks is that it's characters don't
have time to develop. We don't care as much about these ones as we did
about Hooper and Brody and Quint to some degree. But that is a small
detail, because the film does it's job and that is to scare us. Look
for one more scene where Tina and her boyfriend are boating by
themselves. It will stay with you for quite some time.Maybe if this was Spielberg's film he would have done something
different. But the one thing he couldn't do is to make it more of a
frightening experience than it is. So that is a compliment to Szwarc, I
just wonder what happened to him. Because he has a vision and a style
that is very reminiscent to Spielberg's original. If you haven't seen
this by now, treat yourself to the first one and then watch this one
right after. Especially to all the young people that are on the IMDb,
Jaws is a classic piece of film making and I have said that it is the
best film ever made, and it is. But if you want to be scared, Jaws 2
will fulfill that need just as well as the first and better than any
film that has come out in the 90's.And finally, has there ever been a better tagline in the history of

Ford's character rummages through a strange city looking for his kidnapped

acting, this film is almost all Ford and Emmanuelle Seigner, very few of the
supporting characters make much of a mark here. For me, the most intriguing
part is the almost total lack of chemistry between those two characters.
Though they are in most of the second half of the film together, neither one
cares a rip about the other's wish (him=to get his wife back, her=to get her
money). But if you think about it, how much would a young, drug-pushing

absolute must-have. The print of this 1965 classic is gorgeous, and for
the first time since its theatrical release viewers can see the film in
its original wide-screen format. For those who -- like me -- purchased
the HBO Video version on VHS, don't worry: The original
spare-but-effective electronic score has been restored, instead of the
""updated"" abomination that made the VHS print almost unwatchable.Although I've never heard Dan O'Bannon acknowledge it, certain elements
of this film must have been in his mind when he was working on ""Alien"":
Two spaceships are drawn to an eerie, fog-shrouded planet by a
mysterious radio signal, then snatched from orbit by an irresistible
force. After crash landing, the surviving crew find themselves pitted
against their own dead shipmates, resurrected by the parasitic
mentalities of the planet, a dying race who must find a new home.
There's even a scene where Barry Sullivan and Norma Bengell investigate
an ancient, derelict alien spacecraft, complete with giant skeletons
(any of this sound familiar?)The set designs -- the cavernous interior of the spaceship and the
appropriately alien fixtures of the derelict -- are some of the best
you'll find in any pre-1968 science fiction film. Sullivan is suitably
stoic as the warrior-scientist Captain; the supporting cast and in
particular the luscious Ms. Bengell turn in remarkably understated
performances, perfectly conveying dread verging on panic. While this
movie may disappoint fans of director Mario Bava who are more familiar
with his horror films, as a science fiction film buff I rate it a solid
7.",88,1965
758,9.666666666666666,8.0,"If you have ever come out on the short end of a sibling rivalry and/or
felt seriously wronged by a parent(s), you will probably connect nicely
with ""East of Eden"" (1955). Since the majority of viewers meet these
criteria it is easy to see why the film finds a new audience with each
generation. And it is easy to understand the tears that are often shed
by both first-time and repeat viewers.Although set at the start of World War I, the generational issues
portrayed really had came to a head by the mid-1950's. Which is why the
film was so timely and contemporary when it was released. It was Elia
Kazan's troubled relationship with his own father that first attracted
him to Steinbeck's novel and caused him to focus the film on the
portion of the story that addressed this issue. Originally I ranked it a distant third in the James Dean film pecking
order but over the years it has somehow passed ""Giant"" and ""Rebel
Without a Cause"" IMHO, and I now find it to be clearly his best and
more enduring work. It is a real actors/director's film, with just six
significant characters and with especially good performances from Dean
and from Julie Harris. Both were a bit old for their parts but Dean's
boyish manner allowed him to sell the character and Harris (who had
convincingly played a twelve year old just a few years earlier in
""Member of the Wedding"") looks the proper age in every scene except one
(an outdoor scene shot in the bright sun). She struggles sometimes with
reining in her sophistication but that could just be the subjective
perception of this viewer. Here are some random points to appreciate in this great film:Don't misinterpret Cal's (Dean) motivation, he is not doing things to
win his father's love but because he loves his father (communicated by
the early scene where he watches his father working in the kitchen).
The former motivation would be simplistic; the latter opens up a host
of interesting and ironic interpretations as you realize the seemingly
bad son Cal actually understands his father and admires his goodness
more than ""good"" son Aron (Richard Davalos).Aron is not really the innocent figure he appears to be, he does not
like Cal and throughout the film betrays him.Abra (Harris) is caught between the two brothers, moving steadily from
Aron to Cal as the film progresses. Aron represents everything she
understands that she should be and Cal represents everything she has
been denying herself. The story is largely seen from her point of view,
and her growth parallels her (and the audiences) slow realization that
Cal is not bad but misunderstood. The two are slowly falling in love
but do not kiss until she gets up in the ferris wheel, a place where
(symbolically) she is no longer standing on solid practical ground.It is really a coming of age story for both of them, with Abra slowly
embracing new areas of human experience and Cal moving from adolescence
to manhood; thanks largely to her timely interventions. Watch for
subtle details that Kazan has included, like Cal's inability to make
extended eye contact with his father, brother, and mother; something
that he has no problem doing with Abra. And Cal's unsteady progress as
he moves forward momentarily and then retreats by looking away.Note Kazan's use of a raked camera angle for the scenes inside the
Trask home, unfortunately this device is a little too extreme and calls
attention to itself. Also used in ""The Third Man"", it was done here to
reinforce the off-kilter nature of this family's dynamic. It goes away
after the scene in which Cal finally confronts his lifelong jealousy of
his brother and accuses his father of rejecting him because he is so
much like his mother, telling Adam (Raymond Massey) that he cannot
forgive himself for having married Kate. This is the point at which Cal
moves forward into permanent manhood, prior to this he had stepped
forward briefly and then retreated back into childhood.Watch for the method-acting device of an actor playing with an object
as a means to introduce naturalism into the scene (Abra first flirts
with Cal with a flower, Jo Van Fleet makes a show of taking out and
lighting a cigarette, Cal repeatedly dips his finger into a wine
glass). ""East of Eden"" would be nothing but an overwrought melodrama
without a host of little things like this that humanize the story.Watch for the awkward tension in all the scenes between Cal and Adam,
Kazan cultivated the off-screen friction between Dean and Massey;
reasoning that it would translate into more realistic on-screen
sequences between the two actors. Watch for the stunning sequence late in the film when Cal slowly moves
out from under the tree branches (his menace reinforced nicely by the
score).Finally note the contrast between the restrained closing scene (which
is also the climax) and the melodramatic style of the almost everything
that has preceded it in the film. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",118,1955

identify with him and his dilemma. It seemed he felt like a stranger in an
even stranger land. Who were these humans that seem so happy in the same
world he could not find happiness within? What is this life we live? More
importantly, what is the point? Why bother? His great battle with existence
was a philosophical one. He, like myself, felt infinite sadness over the
knowledge that are no concrete answers...The movie is also interesting because it attacks the main sexual organ, the
mind. Graham while trying to distance himself from the human experience by
capturing sex confessionals on videotape, perhaps unwittingly became more
intimate with his ""partners."" Roger Ebert points out that the films'
argument is that conversation is better than sex.Personally, I think the movie is about trying to find happiness with another
person. Some Modest Mouse song lyrics come to mind. ""And it's hard to be a
human being/ And it's harder as anything else/ and I'm lonesome when you're
around/ I'm never lonesome when I'm by myself""
Graham finds it hard to be a human being and live in this human world full
of values that he finds strange, confusing, and most importantly
unfulfilling. What do you do when your ideology and needs don't mesh in the
society you live within? How does one deal with feelings of loneliness in a
society that spurns him? This movie is about one man's
way.James Spader does such an excellent job as this character. In fact, great
acting all around by the entire cast and excellent writing and directing by
Mr. Soderbergh.

766,4.333333333333333,7.2,"Highlander is an ingenious and very entertaining science fiction film
which has come in for rather a lot of (unwarranted) scathing criticism.
Although the plot jumps around with reckless abandon, the scripters
Gregory Widen, Larry Ferguson and Peter Bellwood manage to pull in all
the loose ends by the climax. The word ""confusing"" has been used to
describe the film quite often as well, but if you stick with it the
confusing moments are explained quite cleverly towards the closing
reels. This is, in fact, not a bad film at all. I'd venture to say it's
a pretty good one.The opening sequence has Russell Nash (Christopher Lambert) at a
wrestling match in New York's Madison Square Gardens. He leaves early,
and while walking through the underground car park is confronted by a
man with a sword. Nash is not perturbed by this - he merely brandishes
a sword of his own, and the pair of them fight to the death, resulting
in the decapitation of Nash's opponent. Slowly, we learn (via
flashbacks) that Nash is an immortal swordsman who has spent centuries
duelling with like immortals. The only way they can die is by
decapitation at the hands of one of their counterparts. Each swordsman
has spent the whole of history pursuing the others, hoping to be the
last one alive whereupon he will gain mortality, virility and vast
knowledge.The film is very energetic (what would you expect from a former music
video director?) with dazzling camera work and a pounding, Flash
Gordon-style soundtrack by Queen. Sean Connery has a pleasant
supporting role as an immortal who teaches Lambert the art of
swordplay, and Alan North has a funny part as a bewildered cop who
can't figure out why headless corpses keep turning up in his city. The
film's intentionally muddled structure is slightly irritating on the
first viewing, but with repeated viewings it becomes more
comprehensible, even clever. Highlander is a good, inventive piece of
hokum.... and it's a real shame that those very same critics who are
always grumbling about the lack of cinematic imagination these days
didn't give it some merit when it was first released.",116,1986
767,8.666666666666666,5.0,"Obviously, this movie is not for everyone. It makes last years Sex
Drive look like a family movie. Because of this, many people will be
turned off by the movie. About a third of the people walked out of the
theater when I saw it, and most likely the majority of them went home
and rated this a One. Being a fan of the Whitest Kids U'know, I was
very excited to hear about this back in December. and then very annoyed
when they kept pushing back the release date. But finally, It arrived
and it was great, in my opinion. Not quite to my expectations but by no
means bad. It is true that some of the jokes become incredibly
repetitive, and they dragged the lesbians scene out to the point that
it was no longer funny. But more often than not, the jokes are hits
rather than misses. Many people have given the film poor reviews
because of how unbelievably vulgar the jokes are. Which makes me
wonder: Why would you see a raunchy teen sex comedy that takes place at
the playboy mansion, and was written, directed by, and starring two of
the Whitest Kids U'know if you are offended by vulgar humor? Trevor
Moore was hilarious as always but I do feel that Zach Creggor's talent
was in many ways wasted. He got very few of the best lines, though, one
could expect that since he plays the cliché ""serious"" buddy that is
found in all teen sex comedies. Craig Robinson was great, though I
thought that his character got a bit annoying after a while. But
despite the films dirty charm and frequent laugh out loud moments,
there were also a fair number of flaws. Miss MArch suffered from the
same issue that the latest Harold And Kumar installment did: Every once
in a while they would go just a bit too far. In a film like this you
have to walk the line. In many cases, they would take a flying leap
over it. Which is fine, to a certain extent. The problem was that the
just didn't seem to realize when to quit. Dirty does not always mean
funny. If you are trying to decide whether or not to see it, just know
that it can either be a laugh out loud hilarious raunch filled comedy
roller-coaster or it can be a dull, lifeless, trashy, tasteless, bomb
of a movie, depending on your taste, or lack thereof. I personally
found it to be the former rather than the latter. But it is most
certainly not the type of movie that you should see with your family.

skillfully and are generally believable - they fit into the legend but
aren't overly heroic. Not overdone. The love between Tristan and Isolde
is so powerful that it's impossible not to feel for them, but it is
also impossible not to feel bad for the King, who is deeply in love
with Isolde as well. The film's main departure from the traditional
story is it's decision to leave out the love potion between T+I, which
for modern audiences is a smart choice; it makes the whole relationship
appear more 'authentic.' This is also one of Rufus Sewell's only'
sympathetic roles, and it's a treat to see him play someone we don't
automatically hate. The real heart-wrencher comes from watching the
love grow between T+I while their obstacles grow larger. The movie also
had some great battle scenes, just violent enough without going for the
gross-out factor, convincing but not painful to watch (for most). And
like most good dramatic movies it's not completely without humor, there
are definitely some moments that make you laugh, or at least smile.

action scenes were better than what we saw in the trailer. Although the
doomsday scenes had terrible CGI (you'll know it when you'll see it),

778,10.75,7.5,"I will be completely honest with all of you, I saw this movie to prepare for
the upcoming 2001 block buster, PEARL HARBOR. TORA! TORA! TORA! seemed the
perfect choice. Recent movies these days depressed me, but thanks to TORA!
(and Clint Eastwood 's HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER), my enjoyment in watching movies
returned. TORA! is an absolutely excellent film packed with incredibly well
done acting and emotion and an overall feeling that leaves you blown away.
PEARL HARBOR has quite a bit to live up to after seeing this. The special
effects produced in TORA! are completely out of this world (even after
thirty years!). More credit goes to how well documented this story goes. The
Americans and Japanese did a tremendously exceptional job of recreating the
entire events leading up to and including the Pearl Harbor attack. Being a
Canadian, I was confused a couple years ago when the local paper announced
that the number two (of the top 100) event of the 1900's was the attack on
Pearl Harbor. I completely understand now and quite frankly am amazed at how
both sides felt throughout the entire ordeal.Simply put, TORA! TORA! TORA! deals with all the events, mistakes (both
minor and MAJOR), people involved and attitudes leading up to and during the
air raid on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Though not shown, we even have
the general feeling of the U.S. President and the Japanese Emperor. Nothing
is missed in this movie. It is as close to the actual depiction of Pearl
Harbor you can get.For 1970, the special effects are absolutely astonishing. Very little looks
fake, and nothing looks over done (like many CGI effects do these days).
When the first American battletanks are struck, the explosions are
incredible. When the Zero crashes into the building, the explosion is eye
catching. Everything is unbelievably excellent. The acting is also first
rate, how the Americans handle the warnings of a Japanese attack (they're
nuts) was supremely well laid out. How the Japanese carefully planned the
attack on Pearl Harbor was frighteningly well thought out. Next credit must
go to the music. Jerry Goldsmith has to be one of the greatest composers of
all time. The suspense created on the morning of December 7 just before the
attack is still hair chilling thirty years later. Nothing seems to be wrong
with TORA! except the fact that it is a little too long. A couple times, I
was hoping that the attack would just begin and get over with. My patience
quickly subsided with that music score and with the Emperor's poem. Very
little is wrong with TORA! TORA! TORA!. It is a definite must see for anyone
curious about how war works, how mistakes are made and how people respond to
such attacks.",144,1970

tepid comedy, ""Mr. Woodcock,"" and came up with the following: ""Bad News

""Passion of the Christ"" had more laughs than this pointless piece of

comedic works as ""R.V.,"" ""Are We There/Done Yet?,"" ""License To Wed,""
""Guess Who?,"" ""Soul Plane,"" ""King's Ranson,"" ""My Baby's Daddy,"" ""Little
Man"" and any of the ""Scary Movie"" versions.So, I suppose the experience wasn't all terrible ...Ah, but this film was. With two Academy Award-nominated lead actors

would result, but few come about.The plot has Williams as John Farley (where's CHRIS Farley when we need
him?), a successful self-help author, whose latest book, ""Getting Past
Your Past,"" is climbing the bestseller charts. This notoriety allows
him to be honored by his small hometown in Nebraska.Going back to receive the Corn County Key honor, his trip home only
results in the depressing reality that his mother (Sarandon) will marry
his old gym teacher, Mr. Woodcock (Thornton). Woodcock was not only an
intense physical education instructor, but a sadist.He humiliates, insults and verbally berates his students, throws balls
at them, forces them to run laps and do push-ups as punishment, even
those with asthma. But he saves his special vindictiveness for Farley,
whom he delights in abusing - mentally and physically. He throws him to
the ground repeatedly while teaching wrestling moves; and even forces
him to undress and do pull-ups in front of the other students.Now, if something like this REALLY took place, one of the pupils would
have surely mentioned it to SOMEONE, and disciplinary action would have
been taken against Woodcock. But, evidently, for over 20 years, no one
has ever said anything bout this abuse, so the town decides to honor
him as educator of the year - to be given at the same time as Farley's.Also, everyone in the berg seems to love the old guy, while Farley's
significant other, Tracy (Melissa Sagemiller, ""The Guardian"") admits to
having a crush on him.Meanwhile, dredging up all of those bad memories and combining them
with the fact that the evil man is having sex with his mother, causes
Farley to abandon his nice, passive, positive philosophy and do
everything he can to bring Woodcock down. In this endeavor, he utilizes
the aid of his extremely stupid friend, Nederman (Ethan Suplee, ""My
Name Is Earl""). In fact, the only likable character is Maggie (Amy
Poehler, ""SNL""), Farley's bitchy agent.He challenges him to a workout contest, as well as a series of carnival
midway games and even a corn-eating contest. None of these situations
is even remotely funny in any way, shape or form. During its
mercifully-short 90-minute run, I laughed just twice - once at the very
beginning, and once at the very end.That last guffaw was no doubt brought on by the delirium of the
closeness of the closing credits, however. And longtime commercial
director Craig Gillespie (in his film debut) doses out the ""comedy""

patrons wondering off to movies like ""Death Sentence"" and ""The Brave

called ""Talk of Horrors."" This one comes from the last entry of ""Not on

a curse. Well, Jennifer (Samantha Eggar) and Mark Baines (Roy Jones) go
in anyways, and accidentally unleash a demonic force that has a
fondness for possessing people's left hands. I guess Ned Flanders was
wrong when he said ""Lord Love a Leftie."" Anyways, the only way a person
can free themselves from committing acts of evil is severing said
hand-which will then go after someone else and kill or possess them.
Can Jennifer and Father Cunningham (Stuart Whitman) stop this handy
horror?As you can tell from the premise, ""Demoniod"" is about as goofy as they
get. The plot really doesn't hold up to scrutiny, most of the
performances are lackluster, and the film is loaded with moments that
are unintentionally hilarious. The highlight of those goofy moments is
a police officer demanding ""cut my hand off or you die!"" In spite of it's problems, I found myself kind of enjoying this movie.
It's not really good, but the whole concept is so daffy that you can't

hands severed, providing some fun bloody moments. Add a great score by
Richard Gillis, plenty of (unintentional) laughs and a downbeat (though

782,7.5,5.9,"Legacy Entertainment's DVD is cut. Gore mostly, but the scene after the
drive-in killing is of Louise Lasser visiting Todd at the hospital,
which contains important exposition (Todd who has been catatonic and
then unable to remember the slaying finally remembers that Terry
committed the murder); the DVD shows Louise Lasser pulling up to the
gate and then cuts to Terry and his friends playing football. The DVD
does contain a scene missing in PRISIM'S VHS BLOOD RAGE (NIGHTMARE AT
SHADOW WOODS was the title I saw this under in the theater back in
1987) - immediately after the football game, Terry and his friends go
swimming and Andrea agrees to babysit for Julie. (why this is missing
from the VHS is hard to say). The gore is seriously cut in the Canadian
DVD. Terry kills the kid at the drive-in; the DVD shows one whack and
then the naked girl running away - the VHS has multiple whacks and
blood-stained popcorn. Lasser's fiancé gets his hand hacked off while
drinking a beer in both versions, but the DVD is just a quick
shot....same goes for Julie finding her date's head hanging in a
closet....much more on VHS. Todd's doctor is literally cut in
half....the DVD does not show her death throes or Todd finding her body
later in the film. Terry sticks Artie in the neck with a fork...more
gore on the VHS than the quick cutaway on the DVD.",82,1987

predecessor. The director knew what he had to work with and catered
towards Rudy Ray Moore's limitations as an actor. It's a fun movie
that's more technically sound and acted. The performers don't take
themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is
on the joke and goes with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed
in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in Dolemite.I enjoyed the film very much and I highly recommend it. Just like his
first film, it's catered towards a certain audience (I highly doubt
that Mr. Moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his
career). Check it out!Highjly recommended.",96,1976
784,8.5,8.0,"What a ride....This is a perfect example of what art can generate if
one puts soul and wit into it. Firstly, I find human emotions and life
issues depicted in a bitter-comic manner to be a charming
combination.Love,sex,insecurity,family relationships,shyness,deception
are treated with great humor and witty dialog in this movie.Long and
elaborated shots,incredible story-telling creativity (like 1-st person
camera views,long still frames,distance frames),video-clip like
sequences (beautifully sustained by Simon and Garfunkel's heart-warming
poetry and sad irony).There is enough creative film work in The
Graduate to suffice for 10 movies.The dialog is excellent and the
acting pure genius.And, oh...the time frame...the sixties...don't get
me started.The 2000's are like an insurance seminar compared to that...
No need to praise this movie anymore, it speaks for itself.It is
not,however,a movie for the masses.This is no Ben-Hur type of
flick,with spectacular imagery and epic storyline.It is an epic of the
inner soul.It requires a bit of meditation, it is only entertaining if
you get in touch with your inner self and not expect to watch the
screen and BE entertained. Despite its comic appearance,I always felt
that it touched a sensitive somehow sad chord in me.It's kinda
like:""Haha very funny, but I felt those type of emotions and they
didn't seem funny then.""It's also so easy to laugh at other people's
feelings,torments and emotions, but when you realize that you are also
part of that old human comedy and drama, your laughing becomes more
restrained.More mature.I always connected with this movie, and with
Mike Nichols.Too bad they don't make'em like this anymore.We live in an
era where people like John Woo and Michael Bay are starting to dictate
what we will be watching more and more.What a shame....",106,1967

enjoyed watching this film, which was Silverstone's first major role. She
plays a crazy teenager who has a crush on a guy who lives in a guesthouse.
In her selfish pursuit of the object of her affection, she makes the guy's
life a living hell. She also makes the life miserable for anyone who tries
to ""steal"" the guy from her. I think Silverstone fit her role perfectly.

786,9.75,6.3,"Offbeat--to say the least--comedy-drama from director Tony Bill and
writer/co-producer John Patrick Shanley combines unforced, unshowy
nostalgia with dark (and rather wobbly) comedic undertones. In a
troubled Bronx neighborhood in the 1960s, Jodie Foster is a young woman
hounded by just-released convict John Turturro, while Tim Robbins is a
former classmate reevaluating his priorities based on turbulent world
events. Foster has little to work with in a weakly-written role (she's
not going to meet this nutcase in the park at night!), but Robbins'
quiet sincerity is lovely, and his handsome face and expressive manner
keeps the film grounded in reality. Overall, it's much too flighty,
with a melodramatic final 30 minutes which doesn't do anything good for
anybody--least of all the viewer. However, there is some dryly
eccentric humor in Shanley's screenplay, and when director Bill's touch
is light the film generally works. **1/2 from ****",90,1987
787,9.666666666666666,8.2,"This movie is a breakthrough - courageous and uncompromising view at
the family and at the marriage where both spouses love each other
deeply but they are both not well, they don't know how communicate when
somebody else present, even their own children. They could be happy on
the deserted island but not surrounded by friends and families. I was
fascinated by both, Peter Falk's and Gena Rowlands' performances. She
looked like a little girl, trapped in a woman's body - confused,
insecure, listening to what is inside of her. When she said to her
children, ""I hope that you will never grow up"", she meant it because
she never felt comfortable as a grown up. I could not take my yes off
Rowlands. Her performance is on par with the best study of nervous
breakdown I've seen, and this is Liv Ullmann in Bergman's ""Face to
Face"".Peter Falks was also a revelation - I love him as Lt. Columbo in the TV
series but he is a completely different character here; in a way, he is
as mentally unbalanced as his wife is. The fact that he loves her but
never hesitates to abuse her makes him terrifying - you never know how
he will act in the next moment, and he does not know himself. Directing
and writing are absolutely first class, and I am very exited to see
more films by John Cassavetes, the Godfather of American Independent
film-making and a father of American ""New Wave"" 9.5/10",155,1974
788,10.0,7.5,"The underrated John Payne -- an ideal Everyman -- teamed with director Phil
Karlson in a number of 50s thrillers. All bear viewing, but maybe the pick
of the crop is 99 River Street. Payne plays a washed-up boxer now driving a
hack, and the movie opens in a frame-within-a-frame of his watching himself
in an old bout on TV. Trying to win back the affections of his
couldn't-care-less wife (Peggie Castle), he discovers that she's two-timing
him. Meanwhile an old gal-pal with theatrical yearnings (Evelyn Keyes, and
maybe her finest hour) tries to enlist him in a scheme of her own, which
backfires. Next, his wife turns up dead....Karlson keeps the tension high
but well-modulated while managing to strike most of the images and motifs on
the noir keyboard (including some evocative night footage of the Jersey
waterfront). Overall, this installment in the cycle (which has never
appeared on commercial videotape) remains one of the most satisfying and
characteristic examples of noir in the early Eisenhower era -- slightly less
spooky than its 40s predecessors, but a bit more brutal,

Reginald Christie, a doctor and landlord who killed several of his female
patients in the 1940's and 1950's. Richard Attenborough plays Christie in a
rather silent, but very menacing and psychological way. Director Richard
Fleischer is not portraying a serial killer monster like Hannibal Lector,
but rather a boring and nice guy who turning to a mentally disturbed and
brutal serial killer.The atmosphere in the dirty London suburbs is photographed in a very dark
and intense way, as most of the scenes take place in Christie's old back
street house. The calm music adds much atmosphere to the movie, and young
John Hurt plays the husband of one of the victims. A forgotten genre jewel

791,11.833333333333334,7.0,"This film is a nice change of pace for a Clint Eastwood Western. While
in some ways Clint's character isn't that much different from some of
his previous cowboys (he's great with a gun and is motivated by
greed....until the end...just like in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE), the
chemistry of adding Shirley MacLaine really changes the film. Together,
they create an engaging, though not exactly believable pair. However,
despite being tough to believe, the film is so much fun and written and
acted so well, that you really don't mind.The film itself was made in Mexico with many Mexican actors. This,
combined with a somewhat restrained score by Ennio Morricone, make this
movie look in many ways like a ""Spaghetti Western"", though it was
financed and directed by Americans. For these reasons, the film is like
a bridge from Eastwood's earlier westerns to his more recent ones.About the only negative about the film other than how difficult it was
to believe the plot at times, was that the ""secret"" about MacLaine's
character didn't seem like that big of a surprise,...yet the supremely
smart and savvy Eastwood had no idea! THIS was the hardest part to
believe! However, the film is still great fun and well worth seeing. My
wife, who hates westerns, actually watched it with me and enjoyed it so
I guess this cowboy pic might have a wider audience than some westerns.By the way, which mules, exactly, were they referring to?! This
confusing title had me thinking that I must have missed something!",116,1970
792,9.6,7.6,"I went to see this film with a certain trepidation as I don't always
understand the true workings of the so-called beautiful game. I'm often
rather lost by the offside rule, not too sure what actually constitutes
handball and can't quite understand why a good friend can kiss a poster
of George Weah and refer to the Liberian as a God. However, I can
recognise what a worldwide phenomenon football has become and the
massive status that the late Brian Clough held within in the sport.Clough was one heck of a character and very much of his time and this
is where 'The Damned United' really succeeds. You feel like you are
truly watching the 70s when men were men and modern players like
constant diver Cristiano Ronaldo would have been laughed (or even
kicked) off the pitch. Sheen gives an excellent performance and Clough
is portrayed as a complex individual with the sort of charisma and wit,
which may endear him to cinema-goers who have little knowledge of
football or the man himself.However, I saw this film with a friend who is a huge soccer fan and who
confessed afterwards to having certain problems with the accuracy of
the story. The film is after all based on a book by David Peace, which
merges the facts with his own fiction to show what he thought might
being going on behind the scenes during Clough's reign as manager of
Derby County and his infamous 44 days in charge at Leeds United. Having
recently watched some TV dramatisations of Peace's other novels
involving the real life Yorkshire Ripper murders it is easy to see why
some people find his particular way of merging fact with fiction
lacking in credibility. I personally didn't have such a problem with
this film as I felt it really got to grips with who Clough was as a
football manager and his probable motives for how he went about the job
at Leeds.While the film's narrative sometimes veers confusingly back and forth
between Clough's time at Derby and his short spell at Leeds, 'The
Damned United' is a really enjoyable piece of entertainment full of
great actors bringing to life intriguing characters. The ultimate
strength of the film is that the story manages to become more about
friendship (the relationship between Brian and Peter Taylor) and the
destructiveness of vanity rather than how many football matches Clough
won.",98,2009

thriller. That feeds on suspense and the viewers ...empathy. With its
situational awkwardness and bloody gory scenes. It is under the radar

superior movie then the first film. A better story and less money

Confused"", but, a couple of months ago, I saw the trailer, and thought,
""Man, this is going to be laugh out loud hysterics"". Was I wrong.The movie starts with Jake, the freshman pitcher prospect cruising in a
Cutlass 442, not bad for nostalgia (nice to see cars that still have
some gusto for real in films).Jake is a pitcher who lives in a frat house with about twelve other
ball players who like to party and talk about getting laid, and playing
silly pranks on each other.Yes, there is a decent soundtrack starting with ""My Sharona"" from the
Knack that opens the movie, but, the flaw is here: ""Urgent"" by
Foreigner was not released until 1981. Oops! And it seems a tad out of
place for a bunch of rough and tumble kids to be singing word for word
to a rap song.The title of the movie is misleading ""Everybody wants some!"" is a Van
Halen tune, that was released in 1980, but, we don't get much airplay
from hard rock or heavy metal in the sound track. No ""Back in Black?""
No Judas Priest? No Iron Maiden? This was the pinnacle of New Wave of
British Heavy Metal, and Ace of Spades from motorhead was released the
same year. Plenty of hard driving rock to really pack a punch to
enliven the film a bit.Back to the plot: there really isn't one, except the countdown to the
first day of school, where the ball players go from party to party and
meet some strange characters along the way.I'd have to say the most interesting character(s) are Detroit, the
introverted, hard throwing, paranoid, humorless caricature that is
funny for a bit, but isn't fleshed out enough to really meld in.The bearded virgin who is later kicked off the team, is perhaps the
most reflective and philosophical character in the entire cast. He
talks about the progression of one song on an album while the others
get high.Who put Willis from Diff'rent Strokes in the cast? That isn't Todd
Bridges, is it? He acted very well to fit in, but I don't see that
happening in Texas. And where are the bell bottoms? We only start to
get a glimpse of the underground music scene when Jake stumbles upon
his long haired jean jacket adorned friend who wants to take the crew
to a punk rock concert.As for the pranks, the knuckle challenge between the thin mustachioed
fellow and the long haired shorter guy (who wins the challenge) is the
funniest bit, but hardly enough to warrant a great belly laugh. It's a

800,7.5,3.7,"I'll admit I've never been much of an Eli Roth fan. The original Cabin
Fever was a pretty bad movie but I wouldn't even recommend this film to
Eli Roth fans, as it is a pretty pointless remake. Fans of the original
probably should stay away.If there was one positive thing about the original film, it was that it
had that low budget charm to it. There's something about low budget
horror films that I like and Cabin Fever had that. However, this remake
does away with that charm as it obviously had a higher budget. A higher
budget doesn't always mean a better film, though.The acting in this remake is atrocious and the dialogue is even worse.
The characters are all underdeveloped stereotypes that you really don't
care about at all. Nearly all the scenes of the original are redone
shot-for-shot, but they're handled in a much messier manner. There are
a few minor differences, such as the ""party man"" cop character is now
played by a female, for some reason.As for positives, there aren't many. The cinematography was decent and
the gore and makeup effects were pretty damn good actually. Some of the
music was alright. But that's about it. I don't see why this film had
to be made.Overall, this is a shallow remake of a bad, low budget horror film from
2002. If you've never seen Cabin Fever but plan on watching it, I'd go
with the original, as it is the better of the two. However, that's not
saying much, as they're both pretty shitty. If you are a fan of the

broached in 10,000 B.C. or 2012. But it is a question first time
director Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo tackles in After.Life with
surprising depth and skill. Christina Ricci plays Anna, a woman
disconnected from her almost fiancé (Justin Long) and alienated by her
mother, who moves about her days in a mostly apathetic haze. For the
most part Anna's life seems, well, rather lifeless - until she wakes up
on mortician Liam Neeson's slab only to learn that she is in fact dead.
What exactly that means is the mystery.My favorite way to see a movie is when I know next to nothing about it
(so I won't spoil anything here!), and that's how I went into the AFI
screening of After.Life last night. I knew the basic premise and a
little about the story, but other than that - nada. Which I have to say
is a great way to approach a thriller. The highlight for me was Liam
Neeson (no real surprise there) who brings surprising warmth and
complexity to what could have otherwise easily been a very
two-dimensional character. The other standout was Chandler Canterbury
as Jack, Anna's young student who has a little figuring out of his own
to do. Their performances alone are worth the price of admission. The
director's attention to detail, dream imagery, and color (most notably
a scene where Neeson washes the dye from Ricci's hair as she lies
stretched across an embalming table) reminded me of the stark, Gothic
beauty of Six Feet Under and Dexter. That said, this film isn't cut and
dry, doesn't tie everything up neatly at the end, and asks more
questions than it answers. It's definitely not your typical American
movie - something I consider a positive aspect. If you don't, then I'd
suggest skipping this one an netflixing Twister.",0,2009

audio tapes, the man himself speaking, and through both present day and
period filmed first-person accounts of many others involved with the
making of the 1971 commercial failure of an auto racing film, how the
actor would find his - at the time - skyrocketing Hollywood career
taking a momentary nosedive due to his single-minded passion to produce
a motor sports movie sans the usual ""personal/love interest""
backstories to be found within most all of this sort of film genre. In

persistent philandering and a seeming sense of his own personal career
hubris.This is probably going to be best enjoyed by fans of McQueen and/or

bit. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep -- and not anywhere as good as
any number of real Allen masterpieces -- but it's also completely
enjoyable as a light, bantering comedy. There's something kind of
simple and sweet about it. ""Cute"" was the word I heard from people in
the audience as they were walking out after the show. It doesn't feel
like Allen set out to create a masterpiece here, it feels like he
wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to just
about everything Hollywood is producing, Allen's stuff has a tendency
to charm. Even the fluffy stuff. These days it's just refreshing to go

before I die. Definitely a 10/10.But I comment for a different reason. Sure, you see the philosophy in the
conversation. It is very interesting. What I think a lot of viewers are
missing, though, is the strong characterizations of Wallace and Andre. They
very clearly reveal their characters throughout the movie. I also love the
tension that arises between them. Andre subtly criticizes Wally several
times in the film (note what Andre says about people who stuff their face
out of habit while Wallace is eating; also notice that we hardly ever see
Andre himself eat). Wally is perceptive enough to catch them. This movie hit
so close to home it was unbelievable. I think I've had that conversation
before. The dynamics between Wallace and Andre have existed before between
myself and friends with whom I have argued. If you find Andre a little
pretentious, by the way, which many people will, don't necessarily believe
that that wasn't deliberate. Wally himself finds his friend somewhat
pretentious. And I think many people will be fooled into believing that the
director sides with Andre just because he speaks the most. Some people will
just buy into Andre's ideas and believe Wally is a poor sap. Don't be too
sure that Wally has his life in any order. Don't believe he understands all
that happens around him. Remember the line in Autumn Sonata that made him
weep. Also, notice that Wally is fibbing a bit himself. In his opening
monologue, he complains how hard his life is getting. All he used to think
about was art, but now the only thing he thinks about is money.See, this film is filled, just stuffed, with layers. Who would ever think

judging from the colours in the movie it felt the need to compete with

networks boasting how many colours they showed! Not for the Sci Fi purists this is a good old ripping yarn set in

809,9.75,7.3,"I went to see this movie as a non-Michael Jackson fan with absolutely
no expectations. I bought the tickets for the world premiere as a
birthday gift for my girlfriend. We went to the cinema in the morning
and from the beginning I was moved. I have never done it before but in
the very beginning a tear came to my eye. Thinking that this guy, with
so much energy is 50 years old and about to die. When I bought the
tickets I expected a movie with some biography of Michael, a lot of
interviews etc, but there is none of this in the movie. The whole movie
is about how the concerts would be, but I still didn't feel like I was
seeing a concert. I was seeing a little family making a big project
come true. I also expected to see Michael less weak, than some of his
others concerts, but damn.. If you didn't know he was dead, and saw him
dance and sing like he does there is no way you could predict that he
was about to die of illness. There was no way I wanted to pay for
tickets to his concerts before this day, but now I would pay 500$ for
seeing those concerts in London. Although that This is it was about the
concerts, the movie also consist a little sense of humor, love and a
insight to the worlds climate problems.A really great job, with great cutting and editing. This movie is a
must see for everyone! Even though you aren't a fan of Michael, go
watch it!",111,2009
810,11.2,6.0,"Ah, Moonwalker, I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan, I grew up with his
music, Thriller was actually the first music video I ever saw
apparently. Believe it or not there was a time where Michael Jackson
was like a God to people, a time where women fainted at the sight of
him before really fainting before seeing the sight of him, sorry,
Michael. But Moonwalker was what started to be a tribute to all of
Michael's success of the time right when he released his famous Bad
album that was record breaking, was the first album to have 6 top ten
singles. Michael is an incredible artist, there is no doubt, he writes,
sings, dances, but when it comes to acting or keeping a story straight
with his audience not so much.We start off pretty simple: Jackson's music, life, career, success and
the mania that was the 80's biggest star in the world Michael Jackson.
Later on, Jackson is a 30's style gangster who uses his powers as a
crime figure to protect the children. When Jackson was allowed to be
near children, we cut to him playing in a field with the children and
their dog. The dog runs away, and in their search for it, Jackson and
the children uncover the lair of Mr. Big, Frankie Lideo, a drug dealing
mobster with an army of henchmen who wants to get the entire populace
of planet earth addicted to drugs, starting with the children. Mr. Big
discovers Jackson and the children, but they escape; Jackson tells the
children to meet him at Club 30's, which turns out to be a haunted
nightclub abandoned since the 1930s. The story goes back to the
mobsters attack on Jackson, and here it is revealed that Jackson is
actually a magical gangster, who draws his power from shooting stars.
As one passes by the club, Jackson transforms into a sports car and
mows down several of Mr. Big's henchmen. The story picks up on the
children at Club 30's, and at first the children are afraid, but when
Jackson appears the scary atmosphere of the club transforms and the
children find themselves back in the 1930s. The club is now filled with
zoot suiters and swing dancers. Jackson participates in a dance-off
with the other club members, which serves as the music video for
""Smooth Criminal"". At the climax of the song, Mr. Big lays siege to the
club and kidnaps one of the children, Katie. Jackson follows them back
to Big's lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen. Mr. Big appears
and mentally tortures Jackson by threatening to inject Katie with
highly addictive narcotics. While Katie manages to just grab Joe
Pesci's glasses and get free from being injected, Mr. Big decides he's
had enough and orders his men to kill Katie before finishing off
Jackson, but not before a shooting star flies by. Jackson transforms
into a giant robot and kills all of Mr. Big's soldiers. Yup, ummm, you
want more weirdness? Watch the movie.Moonwalker is fun for the first half hour, seeing Michael's success and
all his hard work really makes his fans appreciate him once again. Is
it mostly to hype up his album? Yeah, I love how he spends the first 25
minutes praising how awesome he is, then we go to his song called
""Leave Me Alone"", which is kind of hypocritical, not that it's not a
great song, just a small turn of events. Then when we skip the crummy
acting, the story was incredibly weak: The villain spells his name out
loud while Michael and Katie are spying on him, lol, Michael is a
transformer all of a sudden, the villain's big monster plan is to make
kids high? Also the villain has some sort of massive ray gun that would
make Marvin the Martian blush. But if there is one new thing that is
incredible that the movie gives us is the new video for Smooth
Criminal. This music video is perfection, it's choreographing, it's
setting, it's song, it's smooth style, Michael always goes above and
beyond perfection and Smooth Criminal was incredible. I loved
Moonwalker as a kid, I still watch it for fun to this day, but it's not
the best movie by any means, it's pretty silly, but it's all good if
you're a Michael Jackson fan as well.7/10",93,1988
811,5.0,4.7,"I enjoyed this movie more than ""Yellow Beard"", but both movies are kind
of similar as they are both period pieces and departures for the two
guys best known for their marijuana humor. Nothing of that sort is in
this movie, but I still found it relatively humorous in places. I found
it a bit funny that the hero of this one was Tommy Chong who was always
the more stoned one in the other movies. I liked the humor where if
pain is inflicted on one of the twins the other feels the pain, this
was especially good in a torture scene involving Cheech. Still, it is a
movie that probably would have been better with two other actors in the
lead roles. Nothing against Cheech and Chong, but they really do not
look like they belong in this movie. For the most part the rest of the
cast are not A-list starts, and a lot of them seem to be related to two
leads. The story is about a couple of twins that feel the others pain
going against a French ruler. Not much else to it than that. Most of
the jokes are about the shared pain, there are other jokes, but a lot
of the other jokes not related to their shared pain miss the mark.
Still the movie was mildly amusing and I thought it was better than
""Yellow Beard"" because that one had a plot that was kind of all over
the place.",82,1984
812,5.6,6.5,"I think this movie got a score it doesn't deserve. First of all the story
is
about an adventurer who discovered America and who was rejected the honour
for his efforts, it is all in the movie. It shows how Columbus went from
being a hero to a nobody, it was his sons who had to fight for his honor
after his death. The movie really presents this perfectly, all from
Columbus' dreams until after he discovered America, got mocked and became
a
laughing stock. So this is not the typical hero movie you have seen, but
it
is rather true to its real story, at least as true as you can get in a
movie
lasting 2 hours from a story which goes over a period of 30 years out of
an
extraordinary man's life. The other movie made the same year about
Columbus
was more the typical hero movie, where it ended when Columbus discovered
America. And the music in this movie is so good, it catches the moods in
this movie so great, this music is as perfect to its story as the music in
2001. I want to recommend people to see this movie again and this time
with
another view, and try to remember what their seeing.",154,1992
813,12.8,3.2,"First of all, let me say that this movie is terrible. Really REALLY
bad. The camera work is pedestrian, the acting is scraping the bottom
of the barrel. The kid was the only decent actor in the movie. The
dialog is truly ridiculous at points, and the details propelling the
plot forward don't make any sense. This is further confounded by the
way the time line jumps around, making for a movie that lurches along
like a wounded animal. The story, at its core, is good, and the movie
could have been truly great had it been made by entirely different
people. Using haunting as a metaphor for the true horrors that are
frequently faced by orphaned children, and ward B as a symbol of the
powerlessness of children who are designated wards of the state, could
have been crafted into a truly poignant, moving, and ultimately
unforgettable work of cinematography, but, unfortunately, this clumsy
attempt at that, fails in every way. If Scorsese had made this film, it
would have been a masterpiece.",90,2013

IMDb site first to find out if it is worth to stay up for. At first I
had my doubts about this one, but I'm certainly glad to have seen it.Without being patronizing, idealistic or action filled, this movie is
the most realistic movies about the environment. Some might say it
lacks gore and monsters, but that is not the point of this film. It has
interesting twists and turns and the characters all are reacting very
unexpected. Again, this may confuse the average Sylvester Stallone fan,
but for me it was very pleasant to see a movie with intelligent plot. The movie could be seen as some thriller/horror crossover, but the
strange thing about this one is that the story isn't about zombies and
that it has a unsatisfying ending, which is good. No pointing fingers,
no big stormy weather scenes and no action hero stuff. If you hated ""The day after tomorrow"", you'll like this one. Cause this
one might prove that environmentalists aren't always right...I give this one a 8/10",92,1972
815,10.75,8.0,"Enjoying a revival on the art-house circuit, this reconstruction of the
famous last battle fought on British soil uses modern documentary-style
reporting to convey immediacy. An effective and bloodthirsty film, it covers
a landmark period of Scots-Anglo history, showing not only the senseless
waste of human life, the total incompetence of the Bonnie Prince Charles as
a military leader, but the barbaric excesses of both Scots and English, and
the iniquity and the Scottish clan' system. The period opened the way for
the clearances' where indigenous people were shipped off and the land used
for (more profitable and less troublesome) sheep farming.It really doesn't have anything very good to say about anyone, English or
Scots, but this won't stop many English feeling it is racist and one-sided
(just as the English critics as a whole were the only ones in the world to
lambaste the magnificently spectacular but historically inaccurate,
Braveheart). Watkins may well have had a political agenda  the film was
likened to a social commentary on the American involvement in Vietnam (as
the gutting of the Gaelic Highlands by the Noble Army was said to parallel
the pacification' of the Vietnamese by the U.S. Army). Culloden, however,
is not only a key historical massacre but almost part of Scottish folklore.
Arguing the details of the battle is still a not uncommon pub conversation,
especially to the north and west of the country. My favourite version is by
an elderly lady who lives near Culloden (just outside of Inverness) who
tells it like she was there'. The movie, although originally made for
television, is also a landmark, and riveting stuff, but whether it can
justifiably be used to further a pro-Scottish Independence agenda is much
shakier, given that it happened a long time ago.",69,1964
816,4.5,8.1,"'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' tells the story of two couples that
are quite different at first sight - one used to each other for years,
the other one rather freshly wed in comparison. Actually it doesn't
tell their story, but it displays their relationships. The film begins on a Sunday morning at 2 o'clock, right after a party,
and ends just after the sun rises. In these few hours we get to know
these four people better then we might possibly want. George and Martha are the older couple. He is a history professor, she
is the daughter of the head of the university. Their relationship seems
to be from hell, full of mutual disgust and humiliation. Their guests
are Nick and Honey. He is the new, ambitious biology professor, she is
his naive young wive. As all these four characters are more or less
drunk throughout the entire film, alcohol works as a catalyst, and we
quickly see the different kind of character traits they have: George is
a cynic, Martha loves to torment her husband, Nick is an opportunist
and Honey is very much a stupid blonde. The two relationships deserve closer examination: We wonder why Martha
and George married in the first place. They keep swearing at each
other. Martha can't stop humiliating George, when they are alone as
well as when Nick and Honey are there. Maybe there is still a rest of
love in them, but there mutual respect has vanished completely. And
then there is the strange story of their son, who is supposed to visit
on his birthday. They way George and Martha talk about him make us feel
that there is something peculiar about him. At the end we get to know
more about him, and we can only guess how important the son is for
their relationship. Nick and Honey, on the other hand, seem to be quite the opposite. But,
being used as weapons by the older couple, we see that their
relationship isn't as perfect as it seems to be, either. Nick didn't
marry Honey because he loved her, but because he thought she was
pregnant and because of her money. And when Martha tries to seduce him
to tease George, he plays the game with her, always in mind that this
woman's father is the head of the university. Honey, on the other hand,
is much more emotional than her husband, but she also is the most
passive character, and the one most affected by the alcohol. Mike Nichols assembled an outstanding cast for his film. Casting
Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Martha and George is a stroke of
genius - not only are they terrific actors, but it also heats the
imagination of the viewer how much their real-life-marriage resembled
the relationship they had in this film. Elizabeth Taylor outshines her
co-stars a little. Never was she any better than in this one; although
her character is the meanest in the film, she manages that we still
feel compassion for her at the end. But Richard Burton, George Segal
and especially Sandy Dennis deliver memorable performances, too. 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' succeeds at something rather
difficult: It makes us care for characters we wouldn't want to have
anything to do with in real life. And although it actually consist of
nothing but four people talking for two hours, it never bored us for a
second.",131,1966
817,9.75,5.9,"These no-nonsense action films that try to convey some social
statements have a soft spot in my books and therefore I sometimes rate
these movies higher than they actually deserve. The Substitute is a
late bloomer in this department since it actually received a theatrical
release and did fairly well. Nowadays films like these go directly to
video or television and the ambition that was invested in these films
is today nonexistent.The terribly underrated Tom Berenger plays a mercenary whose girlfriend
is a teacher at a lower class high school. When she's attacked by a
thug Berenger creates his own resumé and teacher credentials and
assumes her position at the school and becomes the substitute teacher.
Once there he discovers the school is run by a corrupt drug dealing
principal who's using some students there to help him run his
operation. Naturally Berenger, along with some of his mercenary
friends, take action and attempt to stop this operation which
culminates in a massive shoot out on school grounds.While this is an action movie at heart, it also tries to relate some
well meaning messages about today's youth. The way lower class kids are
living, which is dangerously on the edge, their way of thinking and
looking at the world around them. In a particularly nice scene, one
character doesn't admit to being ashamed of how her life is but when
asked if she wanted her child to replicate her life, well, that's
another matter indeed. That one scene explains a lot and it's moments
like these that actually make The Substitute a little bit more
interesting than many other films of similar nature.But the film doesn't go too far into social matters and quickly gets
down and dirty with the action, which is well served and the film never
slows down too much. All the cast are willing and able to entertain,
some real quality actors here and they all fare well.The Substitute in many ways represents a dying breed of movie-making
and it will probably give movie fanatics a feeling of nostalgia in
years to come.",114,1996

stupid counterpart of his other role at this time, FBI agent ""Jerry

available versions present this (shot in 2,35:1-Scope) film in shitty
fullscreen transfers, so you can see only half of the real image and

books, inventing new characters and altering the setting - I'm not sure

alienated by this. I understand that books often don't match their
on-screen adaptions exactly but this felt to me so drastically
different that it was far more jarring than the excellent Harry Potter

Why was this set in some werid quasi-'50s/'90s alternate reality rather
than simply setting it in the original time of the books? (Although I
admit there was some appeal in the quirkiness of this setting I did
feel confused by it).I did enjoy this movie but it isn't fantastic, it isn't horrible but I

822,12.0,7.1,"8 times and counting. That's how many times I've read the book. The
episodic structure of the novel is such that it's easy to dip in and
out of, even if you're reading other things. You can quite easily spend
an hour or a day with Henry and Claire whenever you wish.When I found out that they were making a movie of the book, my initial
reaction was how? There's far too much to cram into a two hour movie.
Surely they'd be better making a mini- series?The fact is, that they leave a lot of things out of the movie.
Characters who you'd assume would be quite important are given very
little screen time, or excised completely. Also, the ending of the
novel isn't used, only the spirit of the ending. The book's ending was
filmed, however, so maybe it'll turn up as a DVD extra for all the
purists out there.You know what though? The movie is great. It's perfectly cast, and
instead of concentrating on every minute detail that made the book a
joy to read, it concentrates solely on the boy- meets-girl-out-of-time
concept, and plays out a love story over an evening-sized slice of
time. Lots of people have complained that their favourite part from the book
isn't in it (Rachel's disastrous first date with another man and
Henry's revenge for it, The Gomez situation, Ingrid, Christmas at
Meadowlark etc) but really, there is enough in this movie to sustain it
and to give any newcomers to the story a decent enough reason to run
off and read the book to fill in the blanks. Those people especially
are in for a treat, as while the movie does have it's moments of high
drama, there is a noticeable lack of darkness, which the book has in
spades. Also kudos must go to Bruce Joel Rubin for the writing of a
brand new scene featuring a time travelling Henry and his mother on a
subway train, which slotted in perfectly to the TTW world.Rachel McAdams makes a stunning Claire, her scenes revolving around the
pregnancy issues they have are completely believable and heartfelt.
Early reports suggested Eric Bana wasn't up to snuff in his performance
of Henry. I can only assume those reviewers had been watching a very
rough cut, as I thought he was fantastic. Special mention also to
Arliss Howard as Henry's dad, and Stephen Tobolowsky as Kendrick, who
both go to demonstrate how scenes can be stolen with very limited
screen time.For everyone who's going in expecting the book, lower your
expectations. It isn't the book. What it is, is a condensed version of
the main love story from the book, played out perfectly with respect
for the text. I enjoyed the movie immensely, and am looking forward to
seeing it again. If I want the book, I'll read the book. My imagination
is perfectly capable of providing me with the visuals I need. However,

someone else do the work, I'll be watching the movie.",107,2009

For anyone who has seen the wonderful Lego Batman Movie currently out
in theatres you will literally be jaw-dropped at how bad Gotham City
Breakout is. The Lego DC series started off so well but gradually got
worse and worse. I have no interest left in this series. It was a
mistake to shift the focus away from Batman and bring in the rest of
the Justice League, especially Superman, who just doesn't work as a
character, in any capacity, in 2017.There is no plot here, just a mess of scenes, but I will try to put it
in something resembling a sense-making order. Batman goes away on
vacation for his crime-fighting anniversary while Superman does a
pretty poor job of watching over Gotham City. Sounds simple enough but
they both go off on so many tangents that nothing at all seems to be
the focus. The characters are aggravating, the writing so juvenile and
cringe-worthy it would make CBeebies blush, and the musical score, as

825,7.5,5.0,"I know I've commented on this film before, but my first review made it seem
like this was just another movie that I like. Actually, it is so much more
than that. The fact that it is actually a couple of films edited together is
enough for you to try and find this (it is very rare.) I have the version
under the title ""Track of the Vampire"", which apparently has more footage
than the original release in 1966, which was under the title ""Blood Bath"",
and although people say it's confusing, it's rather easy to understand,
although the foreign footage is sometimes obvious. This is one of my
favorite movies, to say the least. There is something about this certain
vampire film that I like more than the others, maybe it's just how it's put
together, or how it is sometimes bizarre. The credits were a little strange,
or at least how they are listed in movie guides:
certain actors are listed as main stars although they have lesser roles. The
acting wasn't bad, nothing oscar winning of course, but it wasn't horribly
wretched or anything like that. Roger Corman was involved in this, and he
did a fine job. When the film was originally released, it was double-billed
with ""Queen of Blood"", which also used footage from a foreign film (a
Russian sci-fi.) Now, to say that the film is very scary or exciting would
be a lie, but it is entertaining. In fact, it is so entertaining that you
should try and find it on video (although I don't think it has been legally
released on laser disc or DVD.) The one thing that I really don't understand
is why Marissa Mathes was credited before Lori Saunders even though Saunders
was the only one to survive in the end and was in it more than Mathes.
Another thing about the credits, why isn't Karl Shanzer listed in some movie
guides, he seems to be the hero in the film, although there is no particular
real hero. Like I said, my print was the one with more footage, so it might
seem a little strange. But despite that, you should go out and find this
film, because it is somewhat forgotten today, which is un-fair, because it
is very well done.",62,1966

a
lot of peculiar films (The Keep, The Island, A Zed and Two Noughts, Eye of

nature.It has almost no plot. What little plot there is details the efforts of
two
escaped convicts to evade a menacing black helicopter as they flee through
the rugged landscape of some un-named South American country. Did they
really commit a crime at all? Why does the chopper pilot want to catch
them?

obligatory shower scene, and a terrific ending in which the beasts
gatecrash a party with bloody results, the film entertains from the

preposterous plot with just the right mixture of seriousness and
knowing silliness (watch the ventriloquist scene for the loopiest
moment, when the dummy's eyes flick back and forth as its owner is
killed!). Ace make-up FX man Rob Bottin's work is top-notchthe
monsters may be men in suits, but they are still effectively disgusting
looking things, equipped with razor sharp fangs, weird extended
fore-arms and obscenely bulging craniumsand the seasoned leads
(including Vic Morrow as town bad-guy Hank Slattery) give credible
performances. The big breasted girls in the movie are also great,
gamely shedding their clothes at every chance and enthusiastically

the movie also predictable. Nevertheless, I think the movie delivers
its messages well and not so much in a preachy kind of way. It helps
the messages of the movie come across and therefor the movie is an
effective one.As a matter of fact; everything in the movie works out quite well. This

characters themselves. The movie is a good balance of fun and
entertainment and some more serous and dramatic family plot-elements,
that of course never divert from the movie its fun and pleasant
elements.Not too much about the story really, it's actually kind of silly and
hard to believe but it serves as a good basis for the movie to tell its
story. The characters and actors in the movie are definitely good
enough to make the movie more fun and entertaining to watch. Tim Allen
fits the role and the movie has a great supporting cast with actors
such as Greg Germann, Patrick Warburton and James Belushi in some good
and fun comedy roles.It's easily a movie I would watch again.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",98,2001
830,6.25,6.6,"Saw the film this morning at a Sunday Times preview and I'd like to
think that more than a few of you will be eating your words when you
see the finished product. It's beautifully put together, with lots of
humour, the attractive Colin Firth and many superb performances. Celia
Imrie creates a colourful character in Mrs Quickly, Imelda Staunton is
fantastic as the cook (Mrs Blatherwick) and Angela Lansbury is expertly
cast as Aunt Adelaide (despite the feathered dress making her look like
a turkey!) As guessed at on another thread, Nanny McPhee does teach the
children - that manners matter, you should be responsible for your
actions, and that actions have consequences. It isn't dumbed down,
there's certainly no 'dopey dialogue' - and there's also no annoying
Americanisms as beset Charlie & the Chocolate Factory.At first glance, you could imagine Emma Thompson giving a very over the
top performance, given the warts, over-sized nose and tooth. Instead
she gives a careful and considered performance - everything in the
right measure.Enjoy Nanny McPhee for what it is - a large dose of magical escapism
with plenty of laughs for good measure. A few rude words and food
fights to keep the kids (and parents) happy, oh and a dancing donkey,
but overall a film that is lots of fun. Can't wait for the DVD.",97,2005
831,7.666666666666667,7.4,"I'm not very good at plot synopsis, and I very rarely write reviews,
but this film could quite possibly be a distant cousin to David Lynchs
'Eraserhead', in that it involves a marriage gone wrong, a (perhaps)
mutant baby, infidelity, and so much more that is felt emotionally
rather than explained and read into.It contains the most OTT, eccentric, and brilliant performances I've
ever seen, and you can't say that about many films, where the
performances are unique and different. There's serious acting, hammy
acting, B movie acting, serious/Oscar winning acting, comical acting,
silent film acting, but never any acting like you have seen in this
film. And I guess you could include David Lynch acting, as thats pretty
unique too. And of course method acting.Its like watching a theatrical play in cinematic form on acid. A lot of
acid.I showed this to my friend who has the darkest possible taste in films
I've ever known, owns over a thousand dvds, and even he was blown away
by the sheer chaos, resonant imagery, beautifully swift camera work and
photography, and of course, the performances. Most notably Isabella
Adjani who manages to be sexy and scary as hell at the same time. Her
performance in this is monumental, especially the often noted
'underground menstruation' scene which could induce some viewers to a
panic attack. I certainly nearly had one when I watched the film for
the first time.When a character has a breakdown in this film (both of the leads) its a
REAL breakdown. And boy, do you ever feel it. Its realistic yet
surreal. God knows how the director managed to coax these types of
performances out of his actors. He must of drugged them or hypnotized
them or something. He certainly didn't just yell 'action'.The way the scenes are cut together is highly unusual and
unconventional but it makes absolute perfect sense. I don't know how,
it just does. I'm unfamiliar with the directors other work but if its
even half as good as this I'll order everything I can get of his.Recommended to any open minded individual who likes films that draw

834,8.8,4.3,"...the flop that deserves six of its Razzies and the nomination for
Worst Picture of the Decade?I think, ""Striptease"" (1996) directed by Andrew Bergman based on the
book by Carl Hiaasen, is all of the above - a curious mixture of
laughs, satire, absurdism, darkness, silliness, and over-seriousness.
The latter comes from Demi Moore who plays Erin Grant, the FBI
secretary - losing her job and the custody over her daughter to no good
small time crook wheelchairs stealing husband (Robert Patrick looking
and acting like a stoned, redneck version of Gary Oldman) and who takes
a job as an exotic dancer in the local club ""Eager Beaver"" to earn
money for her court appeal. In the club she becomes the hottest
attraction and meets many...interesting characters, the most colorful
being, of course Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) who ""just
loves naked women. It's a character flaw"" and who is absolutely smitten
by Erin. Erin also makes friends with a club bouncer, Shad (Ving
Rhames) who is perhaps the best thing in the movie - clever, sharp,
sarcastic, with the great sense of humor. One scene where Shad tells to
Dilbeck's bodyguards that Meryl Streep used to work in ""Eager Beaver""
as an exotic dancer and they seem to believe him is brilliant. If only
everything had been as good as he was we would've had a really great
movie. What do we have now? Well, Demi Moore looks really good with the
minimum clothes on. I mean, the woman was a 33 year old mother of three
at the time and her body was marvel to behold. I just think that she
was too serious, intense, and solemn doing the striptease numbers 
after all it is not only strip it is tease, too. It goes to her acting
in the movie in general. Reynolds seemed to have a lot of fun with his
sleazy drunk Congressman David Dilbeck, election-day choice of
Christian groups and a lot of laughs comes from his mannerism and
quotes. There are plenty of laughs, actually, in ""Striptease"" but quite
often they seem like the wrong and unintentional type for the movie
material. Who had the best laugh? I'd guess, Demi Moore did after been paid $12.5
million  one of the highest paychecks for an actress back then.",115,1996

novel and not be disappointed by it, but this film didn't disappoint in
any way.Details, such as the whiteness of the maids' dresses, the sound of milk
squirting into a bucket, the sloshing mud of a wet English turnip
field, and the glint of adoration in the eyes of the young lovers --
all came gloriously to life as if fresh off the pages of the book.I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys a good old fashioned
Victorian love story.",186,1979
836,10.4,7.9,"""The African Queen"" was Bogart's fourth film to be directed by John
Huston and his performance in it was very likely the best in his career
as well as one which finally won him an Academy Award He beat out
Marlon Brando, who was heavily favored to win for ""A Streetcar Named
Desire."" The screenplay by Huston and the celebrated movie critic-writer, James
Agee, matched Bogart with Katherine Hepburn in what amounted to a
two-star tour de force in a deeply touching romance linked to
adventures and heroicsBogart and Hepburn were delightful as they infused their personal
conflict with a warmth, humor, and tenderness rarely seen in films
Mixing comedy and adventure, it was a two-character film, in which
Hepburn gave a fine demonstration of her ability to develop within a
role... The sensitive interaction between her and Bogart (in an
unfamiliar guise) undoubtedly benefited from her many films with TracyBogart was given a rare opportunity to demonstrate his range as an
actor, more than holding his own opposite the formidable Hepburn... He
played many scenes with maximum effectiveness, down impossible rapids,
where he becomes covered with leeches and suffers a severe fever
attack, his drunk scene where he rebels against Hepburn and mocks her
high-blown speeches, and the tender moments in which he realizes he's
fallen under her bewitching spell""The African Queen"" was not an easy film to make, most of it being done
on location in the insect-infested, suffocatingly hot and humid African
Congo But the result was a brilliantly entertaining film, a successful
mixture of comedy, character and adventure",105,1951
837,1.5,4.7,"- Since I recently watched Mario Bava's Danger Diabolik, I had an urge
to see some other, lesser known spy movies. This is Jess Franco's
attempt at the genre and he almost pulls it off. If it weren't for some
lapses in action (and logic) this one would have been very good. But
far too often, nothing much of interest is going on. In a typical James
Bond movie, there are many instances where the action stops to further
the plot. In The Girl from Rio, these stops in the action do nothing to
advance the story. They are just there.- Franco probably had one of the bigger ""name"" casts in The Girl from
Rio that he ever worked with. Shirley Eaton, from Goldfinger, is the
villainous Sumuru. George Sanders, who I always get a kick out of
watching, is very funny as the equally villainous Sir Masius. The
biggest problem with the casting is Richard Wyler as the films hero.
He's not interesting enough to carry the part.- Having watched a few Franco movies over the past few years, The Girl
from Rio is decidedly tame. While the movie has its moments, the usual
Franco sleaze is not evident. Too bad - it might have made some of the
non-action moments more tolerable.",94,1969
838,3.0,6.7,"A steady stream of very attractive and nearly identical manikins come
to life and march starry-eyed around the block and up the stairs to a
flat where they briefly meet the object of their desire before
dutifully signing his guest book on the way out. The man they came to
see is the suave Lothario who will try to mentor the socially awkward
teacher living downstairs in the ""knack"" of seducing women. As so often
happens in situations like this, they will eventually end up competing
for the affections of the same intriguing ingénue.This may sound like an overused cliché likely to result in a formulaic
romantic comedy, but director Richard Lester gives us something very
different as he presents the story through a combination of exaggerated
caricatures, fantasy sequences and zany metaphors. The result is that
we are not so much interested in the details of the story as we are in
the fun we have reaching the inevitable conclusion and the social
commentary we encounter along the way. Created in 1965, Lester makes a hefty contribution to the creation of a
frenetic visual style of comedy which will be imitated with great
commercial success throughout the rest of the decade (think
""Laugh-In""). With its mod styling, rapid-fire editing, non sequiturs
and wacky antics, Lester effectively uses this style to provide some
wickedly clever parody of early 1960s sexism, conformity and
consumerism.The film is unfortunately not without some serious flaws. The comic
style which may have seemed fresh and exciting at the time has not aged
well. The good-natured mood of the film robs the social commentary of
any punch or staying power, as does the failure to integrate it into a
unifying framework. Also, the four main characters may be wonderfully
portrayed with excellent comic acting, but only one of them is scripted
such that he ever becomes human enough for us to care what happens to
him, something which is essential in a story that is entirely about the
relationships between the main characters.One may find this to be a very enjoyable and memorable film in spite of
these flaws, but it clearly requires that you recognize how to accept
what it attempts to offer rather than criticizing it for what it
doesn't deliver. I'd also think that it's a valuable film for anyone
interested in the 1960s mass media image of a mostly mythical swinging
London and in the trends influencing popular entertainment during that
time period.",0,1965

842,6.666666666666667,4.2,"One of the biggest ironies of film is that, even though moralist losers
would have you believe that everyone involved in horror films is a
warped sicko, the truth is that just about every major genre star from
Boris Karloff to Robert Englund has been extolled by co-stars as a
nice, in some cases, unusually nice person, while 'respectable' stars
of light-hearted films or ""A"" dramas like Danny Kaye, Judy Garland,
Stan Laurel, Marlon Brando and Joan Crawford are infamous for being
less than pleasant to be around off-camera. Sure The Chaney family was
eccentric, Bela Lugosi would probably have preferred being Dracula than
himself, Christopher Lee is(lovably)arrogant, John Carradine was a less
than ideal father and Herbert Lom is less than eager to talk about his
horror work, but horror stars are, by and large, often friendly people.
My interactions with many of them at conventions(as well as a once in a
lifetime encounter I had with Peter Cushing while on vacation in
Britain)have confirmed this for me. Even minor actors like Whit Bissel
and Paul Ehlers(star of the silly slasher movie 'Madman')have come off
as very normal or down-to-earth in person.But wouldn't it be great, however, if for once there WAS a horror film
star who truly was just as much a fiend off-camera as on? It may not be
very good, but Norman Thaddeus Vane's 'Frightmare' aka. 'The Horror
Star' provides you with an opportunity to see such an actor!Ferdy Mayne, who gave what is in my opinion, the greatest portrayal of
a vampire of all time as the menacing Count Von Krolock in Roman
Polanski's 'The Fearless Vampire Killers' plays Conrad
Ragzoff(mispronounced 'Ragoff' and 'Radzoff' several times)an aging
horror film star with a homicidal temper who has this hilarious ability
to brutally murder people in plain sight and just walk away from it.
Still, Ragzoff comes off as the closest thing to a sympathetic
character in this. It's clear he loves his wife and fans. Although I
eagerly anticipated each coming slasher flick in the era when this film
was made and I was young, my true interest lay in the classics of
Hammer & Universal, so I felt like a fish out of water back then. I
could really relate to Conrad as I too felt like a discarded relic; a
fan of Gothic castles, foggy cemeteries and moonlit nights rather than
horny teens getting sliced and diced(and now in this era of crappy
remakes and lame plot twists I'm nostalgic for those things too!). After dying, Conrad's body(still wearing his vampire costume) is stolen
by a gang of the most blandly nondescript teenagers(each of whom pretty
much has VICTIM stamped on their heads) imaginable. Seriously, the cast
was almost entirely killed off and I still had no clue to who they
were!(one of the teens is played by a young Jeffrey Combs; take a guess
who gets top-billing on bootlegs of this movie). Conrad's grieving
widow contacts him through an obnoxious medium, and he comes to life
with demonic powers and goes on a killing spree, But because the teens
are so nasty, with them humiliating Ragzoff's body by kissing him and
dancing with him, one's sympathy ultimately ends up lying with Ragzoff
rather than the teens.It's here where the film starts going to hell. For the first 17 minutes
it is a good send up of the horror film industry, with a great
performance by Mayne(though nowhere near as good as Krolock)but then it
just turns into a typical slasher film with Gothic overtones, Conrad
may as well just be Jason wearing a Dracula costume since he has no
dialog. The murders are well-handled, but fairly uncreative(though a
scene where Conrad levitates a coffin to bash a woman unconscious, and
later to levitate a coffin with a live victim inside into a crematorium
is so awesome it must be seen to be believed.). The film also has
lighting that ranges from very nice, soap opera-like chiaroscuro to so
bad you can hardly see what's going on. The plot has lots of holes too,
the teens specifically mention that their boarding house is where
Ragzoff once lived, and it's apparently the same building that we see
him living in just a few days earlier! Did his heirs rent it out THAT
fast? It's obvious the teens had been living there for some time. It
also seems unrealistic that Ragzoff would be allowed such an elaborate
and well-publicized funeral considering that he was working in
commercials and it's made clear that he wasn't an ""A"" horror actor like
Karloff or Price but a ""B"" lister like George Zucco or Lionel Atwill,
one of the characters even says ""His entire life was a B-movie"".
Bizarre. Still, there's a nice chase through a cemetery at the end, as well as a
consistently creepy atmosphere. The ending is also superbly downbeat.
I'd say it ranks with 'House of the Long Shadows' as an interesting
attempt to revive classic horror.Ferdy Mayne never got the deserved chance to become a horror star, but
at least he got to show what he could have done. Long live Conrad
Ragzoff! Let him rank with Paul Toomes('Madhouse""), Byron
Orlock(""Targets""), Basil Karlo(Batman villain Clayface), Luis
Belski(From Marvel Comics ""Dracula Lives"" magazine) and Paul
Henderson(""The House that dripped Blood"") as the
greatest(fictional)horror star who ever lived!",86,1983
843,11.8,6.7,"Dennis Hopper's film Colors may seem like hundreds of miles removed
from his first feature as director Easy Rider, but it's made twenty
years later and it shows effectively at least two things on his part:
first, that he can express himself in material that would appear to be
a ""for-hire"" work, specifically with having an older, calmer version of
himself in Duvall (the kind that tries to think things through and can
be ferocious but has experience from a life of work) and Penn (the
young hot-head who you know is good but is troubled in other ways), and
secondly that he can go back to some of his earliest acting roots,
working in movies featuring rebels and gangs (not least of which Rebel
Without a Cause) and actually give them the fire and energy and
as-much-as-possible realism so desperately needed. Colors is a mature
work from a filmmaker who knows what he's doing, and will let the
actors and the mood of the streets and the temperament of the current
events (which were practically untenable in the late 80s and early 90s
in gang-banger) LA.Matter of fact, this should have been Hopper's professional
calling-card, showing that he can make a film that isn't an art-film or
too experimental (Last Movie) or under the radar (Out of the Blue).
Indeed you'd have to remind most people that Hopper even directed it
since, frankly, he lets his stars steal the show, and rightfully so.
There's not a solid plot to speak of, more-so a character study of two
cops, one older one younger, who are partnered up and have to tackle
the ghettos and slums, loaded with ""Blue"" (Crips) and ""Red"") (Bloods),
and also the various Hispanic gangs that are not as notorious but still
as powerful and dangerous.It's a series of pieces that soon take shape into a story, but it's not
even about that. It's just about following these gangs and being true
to their nature: of their rites of passage (beating up the new kids and
setting them off to prove themselves), their bond and codes, their
can-do attitude even when they're behind bars or in hand-cuffs, and the
collective wisdom that you can either talk to a cop or just run... or,
another alternative, shoot. It's also about a value system and class
differences; the former relating, of course, to Hodges (Duvall) and
Penn, who don't see eye to eye on how to apprehend suspects or treat
them. Penn's younger guy isn't a crooked cop or corrupted, but he's a
hot-head, a junkie for adrenaline, while Duvall's been around the block
way too many times (and even admits that he had a higher post before
and is still on the streets for reasons not totally made clear) to put
up with being ""like a gangster"" as he says.And the class part relates to the difference between McGavin (Penn) and
his supposed girlfriend, who comes from the Latino parts of the hood
and has family that Hodges has come in contact with as a cop, putting
them up against the wall. It's through this that we see the split
between the people in Lost Angeles, and while it's not a subtle point
really (and may even be one of the more cliché things in the picture),
it still goes a way to try and add immediacy to the drama, and McGain's
own personal conflicts on the streets. And, again, those gangs, some
played by actors (Don Cheadle and Damon Wayans in early roles, Sy
Richardson), others by I would assume real gang-bangers and people
'from the streets' (another thing Hopper is good at, casting real
people, which he doesn't get enough credit for), that are allowed to be
fleshed out and made into real people, or as real as they can be in
this movie.The filmmakers don't make us feel sympathy for the gang members, but
through making them human beings as opposed to just targets and
caricatures, it adds to the whole experience of being about something.
Nothing here is exploited; it's a well-researched time-capsule that
still holds its own years later, least as long as there are crips and
bloods and other gangs and, you know, hot-headed cops with old-timer
veterans. Very solid, professional film-making.",120,1988

(Ghost, City of Joy), and some very cheesy ones (To Wong Foo) and he knows

845,9.0,5.5,"Director John Badham created a classic in the ""buddy action"" genre when
he directed the original ""Stakeout"". He blended gritty cop drama with
fun action sequences, romance, and humor resulting in a unique and
entertaining cinema experience. So what to do in the sequel? Badham
wisely chose to make ""Another Stakeout"" it's own movie and not just a
clone of the original. Had he simply remade the first movie the sequel
probably would have been successful but soon forgotten about. Instead,
the filmmakers go a different route. They downsize the action, grit,
and romance while focusing on the humor. The three leads from
""Stakeout"" (Richard Dreyfus, Emilio Estevez, and Madeline Stowe) all
return in this film. But this time around they are joined by funny lady
Rosie O'Donnell. Madeline Stowe and the whole relationship storyline
from the original take a back seat in this one. Even Estevez' role is
trimmed down. This movie belongs entirely to Dreyfus and O'Donnell.The story here is pretty unimportant, but we will review it briefly.
Bad guys are trying to silence an important witness played by Cathy
Moriarty. Their plans to kill her fail but she disappears during the
attempt. Cops Richard Dreyfus and Emilio Estevez are assigned to find
the witness and stop the bad guys. They are joined by Assistand
District Attorney Rosie O'Donnell. They take off to the mountains and
rent a house in order to spy on Dennis Farina and Marcia Strassman in
order to stop the bad guys. That is just about the entire story here.
But the thin storyline is simply a premise for Dreyfus and O'Donnell to
show off their comedic skills. And they come through in a big way.
Everything in the film is built around humor, even the action scenes.
For example, an early action sequence involving the chase for a murder
suspect ends in tragedy. The suspect is killed by a witness with
Dreyfus' gun. During this dramatic moment, Dreyfus looks down at his
holster to see that his gun has been replaced by a dead fish. This is
not a serious movie. It's a fun one.In the first movie, Badham's taut direction and thrilling action
sequences took center stage. This time, the director let's Dreyfus and
O'Donnell, along with some stunning cinematography, guide the film. The
result is a non-complicated and fun movie that everyone can enjoy.",108,1993

to the Razzy Awards. If I found out this was a high-school student
production, then fine. But a movie made by adults, there's no excuse
for the horrific direction, writing, and acting, and cinematography,
and...well, everything else. Heck, the catering cart for the cast and
crew was probably awful, too. The storyline is insane, and the reason
for the killings is just stupid. Even if they only invested $100 into
this movie, I don't know where they put it. There is one scene of
nudity showing a pair of breasts.I gave this a 1-star rating. Trust me, it's not even close to a solid
1-star. This movie had no saving grace except for the fact that it
finally ended. Unfortunately, this is the type of movie that the horror

tripe, trashy and incoherent. To find a diamond, we have to sift

the role of Hank Williams. He took me back in time and let me see the
pain and suffering the icon faced daily. Hank's was a tortured soul and
maybe that contributed to his greatness. Huddleston captured that and
pulled back the curtain, letting us see inside the man. I think
Huddleston did an excellent job with not only the songs (his voice was
flawless) but with the exact mannerisms and nuances of Hank Williams. I
thank him for doing such an awesome job and for a short time whisked me
back so I could once again enjoy the icon's music. It was difficult to
keep my feet still because I wanted to get up and dance. This was a
great movie and I hope to see Tom Huddleston in other roles.",123,2015

up and charges a hefty sum for this service. Allejandro (William Levy)
son of a Mexican drug lord Victor ( Jordi Molla) buys Nick's plan. The
job is pulled off, but at the escape pad others come in and kill
everyone including Allejandro. Now Nick is being hunted by drug lord
Victor as he wants Nick to lead him to the man who came up with the job
that killed his son. Nick knows Cate (Hailee Steinfeld) his daughter is
now in danger and will be used to get to him. I had a hard time believing this was Vince Vaughn as his hairdo made
him not look like Vince Vaughn. Still it almost looked like him. I
decided that I would wait for this Vince Vaughn as Nick to talk a
million miles a second as the real Vince Vaughn always does that in
those dumb comedies he's in. Never happened. He played a good dramatic
role and I was happy about that. He almost reminded me of a Joe Don
Baker portrayal. Now daughter Cate, at age 16, wants nothing to do with Nick as he
hasn't been around for the past 12-years. Nick is divorced with wife in
rehab. Nick's job is to protect Cate at all costs. Note the title of
this movie.Nick and Cate go into hiding and It was extremely enjoyable watching
the chemistry between them and we knew she would warm to him in time.
(We can only hope)There isn't too much action in here and we enjoy Cate, who now finally
believes they are really in danger. Nick needs to clear his name and he
keeps getting blamed for other killings as the Police are after him
too. There is no twist as we come to know who those original killers were
who killed Allejandro, the drug lord's son. Nick knows who, but how to
prove it?Notables: Jon Favreau as Jimmy Lincoln who helped find the heist; Bill
Paxton as Detective Keenan; Jonathan Banks as Harper, Nick's friend;
and Terrance Howard as Sheriff Braydon.Okay, okay there is a downside. When all was said and done there was no
mention of Nick changing his ways and not do the planning for heists
anymore. Did someone say ""sequel?""Very good story and acting all around and we like it when we see a
father do everything to keep a child safe. Vince Vaughn is good in
dramatic roles and he should do more drama and change that hairdo.

849,11.2,6.4,"The director's prior ""I Am Love"" ultimately transcended its more
pretentious, arbitrary aspects with a certain feeling of epic
emotionality. But this time around there isn't enough substance or
originality in other departments to detract attention from how...well,
pretentious and arbitrary many of his directorial choices are. To an
extent there's interest in simply watching the well-cast stars go
through their paces: Fiennes plays one of his most extroverted
characters; Swinton has magnetism as usual in a contrasting figure
(contrasting because her rock-star has to be silent while recovering
from surgery--but a laughable flashback where she sings in a recording
studio blows any belief that we're watching a credible musical talent);
Schoenaerts is attractive and earnest; Johnson is good playing a
petulant brat who uses her sexual allure in obvious (yet successful)
ways. If you've ever wanted to see any of these actors full-frontal,
here's your big chance, since there's a lot of nudity here that doesn't
seem to exist for much reason beyond producing a ""Look, s/he's taken it
all off, too!"" reaction. But after a while you realize that as colorfully played as these
figures are, none of them are drawn with enough depth to be genuinely
interesting, and in fact they're largely annoying--to each other, and
to us. It's predictable that the 2nd, vaguely incestuous ""couple"" who
make an invasive surprise visit are going to disrupt the idyll and
emotional security of the main couple who have hoped to escape just
such company. It's predictable that there will be infidelity, and that
sooner or later something violent is going to happen. Yet it's very
hard to care about any of this. That the director thinks his actors/characters are endlessly
fascinating is obvious--otherwise why on Earth would he stage scenes
like the one in which two of them invade a karaoke bar, and though
neither of them can sing very well, we're supposed to believe they
quickly have half the island populace raptly watching their
performance? Judging from ""I Am Love"" and this, I've got to assume the
director himself is a product of jet-setting wealth who automatically
assumes the wealthy and privileged are special, fascinating creatures.
Yet ""Bigger Splash"" inadvertently provides the truthful end to that
sentence: ""...only to each other."" In terms of image and editing, the film is flashy in often pointless,
mannered ways that to my mind are neither beautiful or
interesting...just show-offy and empty, the flourishes of a director
who thinks flamboyant stylistic gestures = a true ""artist,"" without
worrying what they actually MEAN, if anything. (He's made a documentary
about Bertolucci, and while the latter has certainly made some uneven,
mannered work, he comes by instinctively everything that Guadagnino
does in an imitative, pretentious way.) Of course, some will be taken
in by it, since some people will always fall for Art that labels itself
as such.For all the talent it deploys, though, ""Bigger Splash"" is ultimately
just a particularly pretentious variation on ""erotic thriller""
material, without much real tension, and certainly without any real
substance. It's not terrible, but it's ultimately pretty trivial. By the way, if you want a laugh, read Luca Guadagnino's Wikipedia bio.
It's one of those Wiki entries that sounds like it was written by the
subject (and/or his publicist), as it solemnly gushes over his
""curiosity and passion for diverse artistic disciplines"" including the
company he founded that ""conceives and implements luxury communications
for luxury brands."" I didn't know about THAT before, but it sure isn't
surprising that he'd have a background in high-end advertising, the
center of the universe for pretentious stylistic gestures about
nothing.",125,2015

them we can mention: Born Free (1966), Brother of the Wind (1973), The

Away Home (1996), Duma (2005), Eight Below (2006), Le Renard et
L'infant - The Fox & The Child (2007), Life of Pi (2012) and The Jungle
Book (2016). In Wie Brüder im Wind (original title) or Brothers of the
Wind (English title), the story revolves around a child and a bird of
prey, in 1960, in some place of the Austrian alps. In nature the eagle
creates two chicks, and the strongest always ends up throwing the
weakest out of the nest. Thus, after being pushed by the older chick
out of the nest and fall to the forest floor, which would be a death
sentence for the youngest chick, he is rescued by Lukas (acted by
Manuel Camacho), which takes care of the wild animal in secret. With
relationship problems with his father Keller (played by Tobias Moretti,
known for Das Finstere Tal - The Dark Valley - 2014), the boy finds
love and companionship in the bird, named Abel. But when the time comes
to release the eagle back to nature will Abel be able to reintegrate
himself to the wildlife and will Lukas find his own release for a new
life?The story is narrated by Jean Reno (known for Léon - The Professional -
1994), who plays the character Danzer, a forester who lives on site.
The film is directed by Gerardo Olivares and Otmar Penker in a
semi-documentary style. Its major highlights are photography,
soundtrack and sound mixing. The images of the wildlife are
breathtaking, especially the scenes made ​​with the eagle. The camera
angles, including the mini camera installed on the eagle, enable the
vision of all the landscape of the Austrian Alps, which is to behold.
In that Brothers of the Wind does not lack anything when compared to
the best documentaries about nature. The sound mixing gives realism to
the narrated story, immersing the viewer in the animal life.The weak point of the film that ends up compromising the movie's final
result is the script. It focuses too much on the melodrama of the boy
's relationship with his father. While the scenes of wildlife are
natural, family sequences are all artificial and forced. The writers
trio (Otmar Penker, Joanne Reay and Gerald Salmina) errs in trying to
turn the eagle struggle to survive into something bigger, making a link
in Lukas and Abel's story. The directors and writers should have
focused only on the nature and eagle majesty, who is the great
protagonist of the narrated story.",98,2015

accompanied by a friend, who has a number of reasons to be against the
war Also Noah gets the girl of his dreams He even marries her'The Young Lions' retains its impact as one of the better films made

masterly musical score by Hugo FriedhoferDirector Dmytryk never misses an opportunity to underline how war comes
into collision with the destinies of people When Brando encounters May

the perfect image of Nazi vices: Corrupt, hedonistic, and, of course,
condemned along with the rest of the decadent Germans Her hazardous
beauty is used as counterpoint to Brando's enthusiasm and beliefs: She
represents all that is bad and immoral while he is everything noble and
pureDmytryk is less awkward depicting the relationship between Clift and
Lange: Their Love is a natural condition They belong together Like
Robert E. Lee Prewitt, Clift's Noah is ill-at-ease socially When he
meets Lange, his reaction is clear, spontaneous, purposeful, direct He
begins to babble a lot to make an impression on her, because, as he

convey the essence of Noah Ackerman The prison sequence is a clear and
simple proof of it The emotional urgency of the young couple is
communicated through looks, small gestures, and soft and tender words

860,8.25,8.3,"Although John Huston's directing is absolutely equal to the screenplay,
winning Oscars for both, it is the performance level of the actors that
makes ""Treasure of The Sierra Madre"" the classic film that it is.
Beginning
and ending with Walter Huston's award winning role of the worn-out old
miner
who is looking for one last big score, Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt are
equal to the task and draw us in to this tale of need and greed. So
convincing is Walter's portrayal of the seasoned old prospector, we come
to
believe that he is a gold digger by trade who only acts in movies so that
he
can dig and pan for gold again and again. His knowledge of mining and the
lifestyle it demands and forces upon those who partake, is so thorough
that
Bogart and Holt seem like school kids in awe of a new hero. Of course, we
know that his son John, did much research in preparation for writing the
screenplay; but we are nevertheless plunged into a sure belief that this
old
miner must surely have been there age upon age, mine upon mine, and has
therefore, a thousand tales to tell.When, in the course of the story, Walter is taken away, somewhat without
choice, to work the magic of a healer for a Mexican village, we are again
convinced that he is a medical doctor hiding out as a prospector. This is
the acting craft in full bloom. Walter becomes whatever is called for in
the
story. However, if one views his other films, the effect is the same. He
is
one of Hollywood's most under rated actors of all time. Those who have not
seen this film have a joyous experience awaiting them. Great story, great
screenplay, great acting. This is why we love movies the way we
do.",126,1948
861,8.5,7.9,"""They don't make movies like this anymore"" is the usual phrase heard

unforgettable Westerns with a familiar supporting cast including Ward
Bond, Victor McLaughlin, Mildred Natwick and other pros. ""The Quiet
Man"" moves these familiar icons from the post Civil War American West
to the post World War II rural Ireland.You don't have to be Irish to appreciate the visual beauty of the Irish
countryside and villages or the beauty of Maureen O'Hara, but your
appreciation of the story is enhanced if you know something about the
unique Irish culture.Ireland and America have been tightly bonded from the earliest Colonial
Days of America and are permanently intertwined since the Potato Famine
of the 1840's sent tens of millions of immigrants to populate the vast
U.S.John Ford perfectly casts John Wayne as the Irish born, U.S. raised
troubled ex-boxer returning to his birthplace and Maureen O'Hara as the
Irish beauty . The rest of the lovingly assembled cast contains mostly
familiar faces in supporting roles.The script covers vast ground in a mostly light-hearted manner. The
story plays like most John Ford/John Wayne/Maureen O'Hara movies as one
step larger than life.It's clear that everyone appearing in this movie LOVES being in the
movie. Maureen O'Hara never looked more beautiful and thrives as the
woman in the middle between two warring men, her brother (Victor
McLauglin) and her suitor (John Wayne).The over-the-top village to village brawl between John Wayne and Victor
McLaughlin is hilarious and ultimately warm hearted. It sums up the
strange Irish notion that you have to physically pummel a man before
you can have his friendship and respect.There are big scenes and little scenes, but every scene is a delight.This is a movie that can't and won't ever be made again. It's a movie

excellent ensemble cast including Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill

Fletcher who turns out to be one of the most complex characters I have

character is memorable and every performance fits in place.The action is sudden and explosive and not always expected. The film
takes
many twists and turns, yet every twist is a natural consequence of the
situations and characters in the film. Ultimately one is left with a

rich cinematic experience which should appeal to more than just fans of
the

864,6.0,7.6,"The Fisher King can be viewed as an oddball dramedy like several others
during one's initial viewing, but then suddenly you're struck by the
hallucinations of Robin Williams's character, namely the sight of the
large, outlandish, scorching red figure of a demonic knight coming to
kill him. Things like this seem at once to throw the film out of
balance a little bit, like the film is making a straight line and
suddenly makes a sharp and brief stab upward, and then back down to
continue the line in the straight way it was before. One has to think
about The Fisher King and realize just how largely, outlandishly,
scorchingly different it is. Think about this plot when you're watching
the film. You'll realize how well it modestly unravels instead of
contriving itself to mystify us. The filmmakers show no ego and are not
interested in impressing themselves. They are telling their vivid,
dynamic story the way good films are made. The story is just completely
fresh and new. And with that in mind, thinking outside the box along
with Terry Gilliam and Richard LaGravanese, one shouldn't even think of
the brief sporadic fantasies the film splashes at us here and there as
anything so jolting.Jeff Bridges turns in a fantastic, despicably likable performance. I
say this not so much because I believe he has a universal effect on
anyone who understands or enjoys the movie. I say this more because I
related to him greatly. I felt like his character was very familiar
with his self-centered angst, bitterness lathered on top, an emotional
and sexual nature quite like mine, and frankly the performance in a
serious relationship quite like mine. Bridges, who I have always
thought of as a very good actor, has my kudos for understanding to the
point of successful portrayal a type of person who is rarely completely
understood.Robin Williams, constantly underrated at this point for his
self-indulgent bombast and personally difficult, nonstop communication
of his sense of humor, is proved in this, as well as several other
films I could mention, that he has true talent and feels his characters
to the very core and projects as such. It is not and never has been
right to reduce judgment upon him to surprisingly shameless
look-at-me-fests like Mrs. Doubtfire, Patch Adams, and Good Morning,
Vietnam, because he has always been tremendously capable. Above all, I
think he is an actor whose work is founded upon intuition. He
communicates his physical and psychological portrayal by emotional
understanding and deep feeling. When you watch this film, do you not
have that clutching grip upon his character's pain? Are you not taking
that journey face to face with him?Mercedes Ruehl is not a token here. She is not just the voluptuous
Brooklyn Jew girlfriend who nags, criticizes men, and makes dinner the
whole time. That is the way her character lays out, because that is the
path the emotional position of her presence in the story leads. She is
perhaps the strongest, most decisive, and understanding person of all
four main characters, and believably so. She is also very sexy and very
natural. Take the scene with her and Bridges stumbling with laughter
down the street after the dinner scene. She is quite real in a scene
that with many other players would've been annoyingly not so.Amanda Plummer is a sad portrait of a very realistic person, ironically
enough in a film that is greatly surreal. She is the lone wolf that
drifts through life, crippled by a complete lack of self-assurance and
with age has become extremely used to it. Plummer's rich, seldom screen
time is great, very wise acting. When she is suddenly accosted by the
attention and adoration of these other three people, she reacts, and I
feel like I know many people who would react the same way.The Fisher King is in my opinion the first great film Terry Gilliam
ever made. He had never made a bad film before this one, but this is
the film that really made me connect. It's filled with emotional
understanding of the human condition and a parallel story and cinematic
style that are so acutely unique and naturally offbeat. It is among the
definitive Gilliam films. Perhaps the click that sounded off for a
truly effective film came with the connection of very similar, very
compatible perspectives between the writer and the director. It's a
determined, forceful, emotional, passionate, and secretive movie.",137,1991
865,14.0,5.0,"""The Abandoned"" has a young troubled woman (Louisa Krause) working as a
night patrol at a massive abandoned luxury apartment building in New
York City. Training her on the job is a cynical longtime employee
(Jason Patric), but what should be fresh on-the-job jitters becomes a
living nightmare when she discovers something sinister lurking in the
building.Perhaps it's because I went into this film with relatively low
expectations, but I found ""The Abandoned"" to really only be half-bad.
Previous reviewers are astute in their observance of the film's
atmosphere, which is laid on thick and is really the central reason
that I stuck with the film from beginning to end. It's
well-photographed and the sprawling Renaissance-meets-art deco
interiors are profoundly creepy. The film is worth viewing for this
reason alone, as it is truly engrossing on just a visual level.The script is where this film is truly weakest, although this mostly
lay in the hodgepodge resolution, which is where the film really begins
to come apart at the seams. It is not necessarily as cliché-ridden as
many have seemed to paint it to be, though it is most definitely
clichéd. At times the film reminded me of 2011's ""The Innkeepers"" due
to the sparse cast and nightshift setting, though a far less subtle
version; at other times, it seems inspired by 1999's ""House on Haunted
Hill"" remake. Louisa Krause and Jason Patric have great chemistry on
screen here, and play off of one another quite well. Both provide solid
performances that are better than the material demands.Overall, ""The Abandoned"" is a middling supernatural horror film; it is
far from revolutionary, and is at times frustrating in its employment
of routine plot devices, but the synergy between Krause and Patric is
great, and the film is at times legitimately creepy, even in its
conventionality. On a visual and atmospheric level, it's fantastic,
but, as I said, the script doesn't match up with the film's aesthetic
strides. 5/10.",86,2015
866,4.0,7.3,"My following of Major League Baseball and professional sports in
general sort of faded when big time money entered the arena. Having
played Little League and Babe Ruth Ball, I'll still occasionally check
the standings, but would be hard pressed to name the winner of the last
World Series. So my interest in checking out this documentary had more
to do with the science and mechanics of fastball pitching, and on that
score I think it delivers pretty well.Over the span of baseball eras, it's still an open question of who the
fastest pitcher ever might have been, and it's likely that it will
remain so. The earliest attempt to record pitching speed goes back to
1912 when Walter Johnson threw into a wired contraption that set off a
timer; his throw clocked at one hundred twenty two feet per second, or
in present day language, about eighty three point two miles per hour.
That doesn't sound very fast by today's standards, but a modern day
calculation demonstrated in the documentary upped that number
considerably.One humorous attempt to demonstrate Bob Feller's pitching speed
involved a competition against a motorcycle. Feller beat the guy on the
bike handily, and it was neat to see the former great explaining some
pitching methodology to a youngster. The invention of the radar gun
brought scientific measurement of pitching speed into the modern age in
the Seventies, and a number of present day, active and retired big
leaguers were interviewed on the mechanics and intimidation factor
involved in pitching against competent hitters.To give one an idea how out of touch I am with the Big League scene, I
didn't even recognize names like Aroldis Chapman or Craig Gimbrel, my
baseball era would have included guys like Koufax and Gibson, both of
whom are also featured here. There's a brief aside on 'the fastest who
never was', pitcher Steve Dalkowski, who's control was next to
negligible but who had a fearsome reputation with a few of the guest
interviewees like Al Kaline and Hank Aaron. That's Dalkowski's quote in
my summary line above, a bit ironic and sad actually. He appeared in
the film as well, looking defeated by life for having missed out on his
life's passion.They call baseball a game of inches, and in the case of professional
pitchers, those inches can add up when you're talking the difference
between a ninety two and a hundred mile per hour fastball. That
difference is demonstrated graphically, along with a myriad number of
insights into such areas as trajectories, magnus forces and speed. It
might be a bit much for the casual viewer to follow, but anyone with a
keen interest in the science of fastball pitching will find it all
fascinating. Even pitchers seem to be in awe of the science, case in
point one Dave Price who can tell you with exact precision the time he
threw a hundred mile per hour fastball - in a 2010 game against Detroit
against Johnny Peralta. Talk about a lasting impression!",87,2016
867,9.571428571428571,6.9,"""Adventures in Babysitting"" is an underrated gem featuring a very
strong young cast. The movie opens with Chris Parker (played by
Elizabeth Shue in a very early starring role) first finding out that
her boyfriend can't make their big date that night. So she agrees to
babysit Sara and Brad Anderson, played by Maia Brewton and Keith Coogan
(both of whom have dropped off the face of the earth, apparently, in
the last 10 or 15 years). Sara's kind of a brat, and Brad has a crush
on Chris. Brad's best friend Daryl (played by Anthony Rapp, who went on
to appear in ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Road Trip""), who is an annoying
wise-ass, also drops by. Things go okay until Chris gets a call from
her best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller), who says that she ran
away from home, and is now stuck at a bus station in the city with no
money and no way home, and of course she can't call her parents. This
prompts Chris to take the kids (including Daryl) on a little trip, and
of course, hilarious hijinks ensue.They have a tire blow-out, and are helped by a mechanic with a hook for
a hand. Their car is then stolen, and they go to try to get it back.
They're caught by the mobsters running the car ring, and have to escape
(which they achieve by walking along a very thin metal beam overhead).
But the mobsters catch them trying to leave, forcing them on the run
and leading to one of the funniest scenes in the movie: going through a
blues club, the singer stops them, saying ""Ain't nobody leaves here
without singing the blues."" So they do, Chris leading, singing a song
about their predicament. It's both cute and hilarious, with the others
joining in singing back-up (""And we should be in bed!"").The rest of the movie is about them being chased through the city by
these mobsters, and of course, there's one funny bit after another,
with some suspenseful bits thrown in for good measure. This is all
hilarious, but the best scenes are the ones interspersed throughout
with Brenda trying to get along at the bus station. Penelope Ann Miller
truly steals the show; scared out of her skull, she has to contend with
such problems as a bum yelling at her to get out of his ""house"" (a
phone booth); getting her glasses stolen by a bag lady (the look on the
bag lady's face when she puts them on and realizes she can see is
priceless); a hot dog vendor who won't help her out (""Then I don't have
a wiener!"" he says when she says she doesn't have any cash); and a
jumbo-sized sewer rat she tries to rescue, thinking it's a cute little
kitty cat (because she can't see). This is probably the best part
Penelope Ann Miller has ever had, and she demonstrates a surprising
talent for screwball comedy.Like I said, the rest of the young cast is great; Shue pretty much
began her career here, and Coogan, Rapp, and Brewton (who was also very
funny on the also underrated TV show ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"", which
I'm dying to see come out on DVD) put in funny, though clichéd, parts.
""Adventures in Babysitting"" is one of those movies that just sounded
kind of dumb based on the title (like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""), but
if you haven't seen it, give it a try anyway; the brilliant gags and
the strong acting made it work.",102,1987
868,10.75,7.2,"I enjoyed this film a lot, both for the drama and the action. I watched
it on the History Channel where scenes from the film were intercut with
commentary from surviving Tuskegee airmen. It made the film that much
more fascinating.As one of the other reviewers mentioned, there is one scene where a
pilot sinks a German destroyer using only this guns. This is a true
event. From the ""Tuskegee Airmen"" site: ""The 332nd Fighter Group also
distinguished themselves in June 1944 when two of its pilots flying
P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft discovered a German destroyer in the harbor
at Trieste, Italy. One of the pilots, Lieutenant Gynne Pierson of the
302nd Fighter Squadron, using only the aircraft's 50-caliber machine
guns, strafed the destroyer, causing it to explode and sink.""The statement that the 332nd did not lose a single bomber to enemy
action is also true. To qualify that, some of the bombers were lost in
other ways, but never to enemy planes. In fact, under Benjamin O.
Davis' command, the group flew more than 15,000 sorties against the
Luftwaffe, shot down 111 enemy aircraft, and destroyed another 150 on
the ground, while losing only 66 of their own aircraft to all causes. I am not sure they shot down the FIRST German jet, but they did receive
a citation after shooting down some German jets. Again, from the TA
website: ""The 332nd Fighter Group received the Presidential Unit
Citation for its longest bomber escort mission to Berlin, Germany,
March 24, 1945. They destroyed three German ME-262 jet fighters and
damaged five additional jet fighters without losing any of the bombers
or any of its own fighter aircraft to enemy aircraft.""Although there were no ""aces"" that came from the 332nd, this was
probably because pilots were told not to pursue German planes for the
kill once the planes were far enough away that they no longer posed a
danger to the bombers.The Tuskegee airmen who commented on this film said that the racism
they encountered in real life was much worse than was depicted in the
film, but much of the rest of the film was realistic.I found it especially interesting that Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. (played
by Andre Braugher) was depicted in this movie. He was a real person who
was one of only two black line officers in the U.S. Army at the
time--the other was his father. He was one of the first recruits
trained at Tuskegee and received his wings in March 1942, after
becoming the first black officer to solo an Army Air Corps aircraft.
After flying in the Mediterranean, he returned to the US, and took
command of the 332d Fighter Group. Eventually, he was awarded the
Distinguished Flying Cross. Following the War, he commanded the 477th
Composite Group and the 332d Fighter Wing. In 1953 he again saw combat
when he assumed command of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing and flew
the F-86 in Korea. With his promotion to brigadier general, Davis
became the first black man to earn a star in the US Air Force. He
retired as a lieutenant general in 1970, and died in 2002, ironically
on July 4, at age 89.",106,1995

870,11.166666666666666,7.4,"Lizabeth Scott did her best remembered work in film noir (more than half of
her only 21 screen credits fall within the noir cycle), and became one of
its iconic faces. Rarely, however, was she called upon to play the
fully-fledged femme fatale, and there's probably a reason for this: She
couldn't bring off duplicity. Her smile had no shadings into wry, or ironic, or smirky; it had but one
setting  a fresh, guileless grin that lit up like a Christmas tree. F.
Scott Fitzgerald (in his sad screenwriting days) observed of Joan Crawford
that you couldn't give her a simple stage direction like `telling a lie'
because then she'd give an impersonation of Benedict Arnold betraying West
Point to the British. But Scott can't manage even that, which results in
confusingly mixed signals when her characters are motivated by malice, like
Coral Chandler in Dead Reckoning: Her smile keeps convincing us that she's
on the up-and-up.Her damn smile keeps switching on in Too Late For Tears, even though there's
no doubt that she's one hard, cold case. She and husband Arthur Kennedy are
bickering one night en route to a party in the Hollywood Hills when suddenly
a suitcase crammed with cash lands in their roadster. He wants to turn it
over to the police, but she persuades him to think it over, so they check
the valise at Union Station. When she starts buying clothes and furs
against the checked capital, it's clear she has no intention of surrendering
the windfall; we learn that her background was `white-collar poor,
middle-class poor,' and that she'd made a previous marriage solely for
money.Strange men start ringing her doorbell. First Dan Duryea shows up, a
blackmailer for whom the payoff was intended. He slaps her around playfully
(`What do they call you  besides stupid,' she taunts him. `Stupid will do
 if you don't bruise easily,' he purrs back). Quickly Scott maneuvers
Duryea into helping him murder Kennedy but still won't tell him where the
money's stashed. Though wary, he falls for her, starts hitting the bottle,
and grows careless. Meanwhile, Kennedy's sister (Kristine Miller) harbors
suspicions about his mysterious disappearance. When the next caller (Don
DeFore) shows up, claiming to be an old Air Corps buddy of Kennedy's, she
makes an alliance with him to find out what's really going on. And the
claim ticket for the money keeps changing hands....The plot is none too simple, and in consequence director Byron Haskin spends
a lot of time trying to keep it clear rather than addressing some questions
about character and logic that inevitably arise. Why did the avaricious,
manipulative Scott marry Kennedy in the first (or second) place? Why does
the sister live so conveniently close? How did Duryea, and for that matter
DeFore, find Scott so easily? But few thriller plots are so tightly
constructed that they survive rigorous analysis. Too Late For Tears passes
muster as hard-boiled, late-40s noir and as one of Scott's hardest,
strongest performances, inappropriate smile and all.",99,1949

underdog sports movie. I loved it. Saw it in a theater with only 3
other people - at noon, on a Monday, raining - but it didn't matter
because I was engaged and wrapped up in the 1950's story of a bunch of
ordinary guys who did something extraordinary.Based on a real event with real, still living, people it is about heros
of WWII who came home and went about their lives until asked to form a
team for the World Cup soccer matches. They have only weeks and decide
to get some players from the east coast and some from one area of St.
Louis, MO. from the Italian enclave known as The Hill.Frank Borghi (Gerard Butler) is the goalie and a leader of the group.
The challenge is to get the whole group to pull together and mesh the
different styles to make a team that may make a good showing. They
don't expect to win as most of the teams they will play are more or
less professionals and/or have played together for years.The soccer playing is exciting even for this old gal who knows little
about the game. The cinematography is very good and keeps the pace of
the game and shots of the crowds and sports announcers ticking along
and by the end when time runs out on the English players, and the
Americans have won this great upset, I was ready to cheer too.I disagree with most of the reviews I have read. This is a good sports
movie and the performances and pacing are as good as ""Rudy"" or any
other underdog film.One thing I loved was the look of the people and homes and cars. It was
the 1950's again and the music I danced to was just right. One for my

874,4.5,7.4,"In trying to get the textile mill she and her family work for
unionized, Sally Field's Norma Rae Webster also tries to earn
self-respect at any cost. She's been leading a dead-end existence: a
single mother, still living with her family, sleeping with married men
who abuse her. But after being inspired by a union-organizer (Ron
Liebman, in an Oscar-worthy supporting performance), Norma Rae is
awakened to the possibilities of life, and, what's more, everything
that is wrong with the mill that seems to suck the energy and hope from
those who stand there day after day trying to earn an honest dollar.
There are problems with the picture: Beau Bridges' role as new husband
Sonny is treated in a trivial manner (he's supposed to be a voice of
reason, but he's too smooth, maybe condescending, and it's an
unconvincing character); Oscar-winner Field's fiestiness occasionally
feels overdrawn and/or one-note, but in many of the scenes outside the
factory she does indeed excel, seeming vibrantly natural and exuberant.
Martin Ritt's direction is focused and firmly rooted (he never
sugarcoats Norma Rae's character, and sometimes she's not that likable)
and the script manages to sidestep preachiness to get its points across
entertainingly. The art direction is really the second star of the
film: vivid, palpably hot and sweaty, with bits of cotton floating
about in the air. The mill in question becomes very familiar to us, as
do the people who work there. ""Norma Rae"" is involved and long, yet it

875,10.25,7.7,"The Western genre has always been misunderstood as a simplistic, racist
(and misogynistic) traditional genre due to the many mediocre Westerns
of the 40s and 50s. However, real good Westerns have delighted us with
complex stories that take advantage of the setting themes: the conflict
between honor & law, wilderness & civilization, and life & death.
Director Jim Jarmusch, who has achieved fame and recognition in the
independent film community, uses the elements of the Western genre to
create his very own poetical meditation on these themes, giving the
genre his personal touch crafting a powerful and original gem.Young accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) seems to have lost
everything as his parents have died and his fianceé left him without a
reason; so he decides to take a job in Machine, a town located at the
end of ""civilization"" in the Wild Wild West. To his misfortune, the job
he applied to has already been taken and now he finds himself really
without nothing. However, his life will change forever after by a
series of circumstances he ends up murdering a man, becoming an outlaw,
although getting badly wounded in the process. Now, traveling along an
outcast native who calls himself ""Nobody"" (Gary Farmer), he'll begin a
strange and surreal trip that'll prepare him for the next stage.Written by Jarmusch himself, the film's story details Blake's trip
guided by Nobody in a similar way to Dante's journey in ""The Divine
Comedy"", where a series of ""episodes"" are used to explore different
ideas and themes across the trip. Jarmusch subtlety mixes drama and
comedy to deliver his philosophical meditation making the film an
entertaining experience, never becoming boring or tiresome. The Western
setting is used effectively to tell this story and ""Dead Man"" toys with
the Western elements in a subtle, respectful and quite entertaining way
that neither parodies it nor makes fun of it in any way.Shot entirely in black and white, the cinematography (by Jarmusch
regular, Robby Müller) captures that feeling of loneliness and
emptiness that William Blake's life has, as well as his collision with
the wilderness of the wild west. Jarmusch camera-work together with
Neil Young's excellent soundtrack give the film a beautiful surreal
look that echoes Blake's equally surreal journey across the darkness
searching for light. Finally, another interesting point is Jarmusch
extensive care for detail in his portrayal of the American west, as
well as his respect for the Native American cultures that play an
important role in his film; making ""Dead Man"" one of the most realist
Westerns ever made.Johnny Depp's performance is remarkable, and probably one of the best
in his career. Blake's complete transformation across the film is a
real challenge and Depp makes the most of it. Gary Farmer is equally
excellent and he is as effective in the comedy scenes as he is in the
drama scenes, showing his flexibility and talent. The supporting roles
present an assortment of cameos where actors such as Crispin Glover,
Lance Henriksen, John Hurt and Robert Mitchum (in his last role) appear
giving outstanding performances despite the limited screen time they
receive. Henriksen certainly delivers his best performance in years.Jarmusch's film is a brilliant poetical meditation of life and death,
but its episodic nature make it feel even more slow than it is, as
every vignette is separated by fade outs that break the mood created.
This really damages the film's atmosphere, as it feels as a forced wake
up after a pleasant dream. Another problem, is that fans expecting an
action-filled Western may end up disappointed, so bear in mind that
this film is more about feelings rather than actions. Despite his minor
problems, the film is still a very enjoyable experience and a whole new
way to experience Westerns, so even non-fans of the genre will
appreciate it.To summarize, ""Dead Man"" is an atypical look at Westerns that presents
Jarmusch's interesting views on life and death in an entertaining,
attractive way. Among the revisionist westerns, ""Dead Man"" is a
valuable gem that is worth a watch. Even non-fans of the genre will
find something interesting in it. 9/10",121,1995

Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Funhouseit's obvious from the start
that The Funhouse Massacre isn't going to offer much in the way of
originality: it's Halloween night, a group of lunatics have escaped
from a high security mental asylum and are killing the patrons of a
fun-house. Nope, not much new there! Still, at least the film never
pretends to be anything other than a whole load of silly splattery fun,
its tongue firmly in cheek as the psychopaths slash, chop, smash, slice
and dice their way through the attraction's blissfully unaware
customers, who believe that the killing is all part of the showat

decapitations), but when it does, The Funhouse Massacre proves very
enjoyable nonsense, each psycho having their own unique method of
dispatching victims: Animal the Cannibal (E.E. Bell) eats them

unusually large drill to treat 'patients', The Taxidermist (Clint

884,11.5,7.2,"Titus. Where to begin? Oh yes, at the beginning. William Shakespeare
wrote Titus Andronicus early in his career. VERY early in his career,
and
such is apparent. On stage, this script as a play must be awful.
Character
motivations are not explained, there are holes in the action, a character
leaves the country and then comes back, seemingly only to set up the
climax.
There is little explanation of action, and it is less poetic than some
of
his masterworks (Midsummer, Hamlet, Lear). And yet, Julie Taymor,
renowned
for her fantastical vision of The Lion King on Broadway, chose this,
possibly Shakespeare's most problematic play, to be her introduction to
film.This adaptation is wonderful. Why? Because it fills all the holes of
the
initial play. She adds scenes without dialogue, she makes the setting
timeless and symbolic, and removes it from the realm of reality, wherein
the
play never worked to begin with. She tranforms a difficult play about
revenge into much, much more. It is now a feast for the eyes, a
commentary
on revenge, power, theatre, film, and villiany.To be fair, I am not giving Shakespeare enough credit. The play he
wrote
has many marvelous aspects, mainly the Aaron - possibly Shakespeare's
greatest villian. He is unrelenting. And in the film, he is wonderfully
acted. Titus is a good character too, and Anthony Hopkins acts him well
enough.It would be easy for a Shakespeare purist to say ""eww, what was that,""
but
I would call this retelling a gem. It is moody, gritty, passionate,
clever,
awe-inspiring, and true to the theme of the original script. It has only
added to Shakespeare's words. Is it perfect? No. It does make you
stretch
yourself, the ending is a head-scratcher, but this will be my favorite

cinema and then topped it off with a cameo by Darth Maul (as we all
know), so I avoided part two like the plague as I really didn't need
any more old Amityville throwbacks in my movies. So now its part 3 and
a friend dragged me (quietly) kicking and screaming to see it and I
honestly did hope things had improved. But.... Nope. This was quite
easily much, much worse than the first one. For a start its a long time
before anything even happens apart from some silly muddy footprints
around a house and some dreadful SFX which are nothing more than actors
covered in some grey greasepaint. The acting is incredibly hammy with
heaps of cheesy dialogue (that guy from Sex & The City being the worst)
then its time to bring in (wait for it.........) the paranormal
investigation team!!! Yes, it's really THAT original. Once again we
have a plot development used in like 1000 ghost house movies since time
began (yawnnn) and I find it incredible how anyone can find any of this
horrible tosh original. On then to a (much expected seance) and the ham
and cheese really gets ramped up. I mean who are the audience for
Insidious? They clearly know little about horror of the past (you just
can't know anything and not see this film as rehashed dirge). I saw
films exactly like this in the 1970s for goodness sake. But hey, maybe
this film is for the newbies, maybe I'm missing the point. But for
anyone else this is a tired, played to death, remake of a pile of old
dusty movies that most of us really don't need to see again. Insidious
is about as original as acne and I certainly enjoyed playing spot the
movie watching it. And guess what? Darth Maul appears again. Yay!! We
missed him (you gotta wait til the end though).",97,2015

therefor I was reluctant to see the movie. I didn't want to see the big
screen dishonor the book in any way. But, as it happens, I loved it! A lot
of people would say ""This is a horror, it's supposed to be scary!!"" And a
lot of people are right in this regard, it wasn't very scary at all. At
least to me. But...the way Arnie turns from such a geek to a cool, tough,
bad-ass was pretty awesome. Also I liked the depth of all the characers
relationships with one another. It definately stirred some serious
emotions
when Buddy and his goons tore up Christine. Most of all though, I think
the
car herself was what made the movie as good as it is. Just the style and
freshness of the '58 Plymouth Fury kicked ass. If you're reading reviews
(like this one) trying to decide if you even want to see it, I say go for
it. What have you got to lose, after all? The hour and a half you would be
spending trying to find a review for a movie you decide to see, you could
have already watched Christine. That's my advice.",0,1983
889,4.5,7.1,"This film tackles subject matter which we still do not see addressed as
often as it could be, with Sidney Poitier as a young suicide hot-line
worker/college student who works helping out a Seattle psychiatrist Dr.
Coburn (well-portrayed by Telly Savalas).At the time this was even more of a taboo subject. A housewife feeling
despair, Bancroft portrays her alienation and desperation
sympathetically and in an understated manner. She has a child from her
first boyfriend, concealed this from her husband (well-portrayed by
Steven Hill) Her husband becomes angry and she begins to feel as if her
life is a sham. Her office job no longer satisfying, she takes to
wandering the city of Seattle, there are several intriguing scenes of
the coastline.There is one moving scene where she is on the beach and comes across a
small group of children who are trying to rescue an injured bird. She
rushes to a liquor store to buy some brandy (not sure how this can
quite help the bird, but anyway...) she returns to the beach to find
the children have abandoned the bird. It is an effective and disturbing
scene.Poitier is outstanding as usual, in that he is trying to locate
Bancroft when she calls threatening suicide. She has checked into the
Hyatt Hotel somewhere in the city. He becomes alternately frustrated,
caring, sympathetic, angry and joyous in various aspects of the film.Overall this is an excellent film with some very good performances.
Highly recommended. 9/10.",98,1965
890,12.5,6.6,"Before writing this review I took a quick look at Wikipedia and the
article they have on the Seabees. Despite the fanciful story that
Borden Chase wrote here about how the service was founded, the Seabees
were actually an idea already thought of by Admiral Ben Morreell the
Chief of Navy Supply even before Pearl Harbor. Unlike the war in Europe where the Allies would be looking to take an
hold cities with facilities already there, like air fields for example,
those planning the war in the Pacific knew that they would be starting
from scratch. Airfields, fuel depots, etc. would have to be constructed
on jungle islands in the Pacific. So the idea of a separate service for
the construction trade was born.Now that we know that the plot of The Fighting Seabees is so much
hogwash, let me say that what the film does do very well is show the
hazards of what the men in that service faced. Trying to build
facilities at the same time as the enemy is firing on them. The
scenario in this film is repeated many times over on the islands of the
Pacific.As to the story of this film, John Wayne reverses roles here. In most
of his war films he's usually the professional military man, here he's
the tough, but inpatient civilian who never seems to learn the value of
military discipline. Of course being this is the Duke, he does redeem
himself in the end in a spectacular manner.A love triangle is tossed in here, rather unnecessarily in my opinion,
a straightforward account of Seabee heroism would have been sufficient.
Wayne and Navy Commander Dennis O'Keefe are both interested in war
correspondent Susan Hayward. This was Hayward's second film with John
Wayne, who along with Clark Gable, and Dean Martin, she once described
as her three favorite leading men. Her big scene is when she's wounded
and thinks she's cashing in, she declares her love for the Duke. Susan
Hayward has always been a favorite of mine, but it's on the strength of
her performances in her starring roles in the Fifties, not as the sex
object in The Fighting Seabees.The Fighting Seabees isn't one of the Duke's top 10 or even top 20, but
it's a decent enough film to sit through even with the World War II
heroic bravado that was obligatory at the time this was made. You even
get to see John Wayne attempt the jitterbug. During that scene, the
Duke looks mighty uncomfortable. He was never going to compete with
Fred Astaire for roles.",100,1944

shot beautifully. The opening shots drew me in for their wide angles
and good framing and nice dramatic lighting(ie what normal people call
a good mood setter)... noirish in some respects. And then it sucked me
right in.Maybe because it started on the stage and the scenes were so long but
the dialogue was so well crafted that you just had to pay attention.Maybe the fantastic real life portrayals by M&M - not straying nor
betraying.But I found myself constantly wanting to talk some sense into Jerry and

ends. And what an ending it is... I'll leave it at that.I give it a 10 because it maybe is among the very best of this category

896,9.0,5.2,"When news first emerged of a Dad's Army film early last year, the main
cry from the fans and general public alike was 'but why?'.
Unfortunately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the end product does
absolutely nothing to alter this.Beautiful German spy Rose Winters (Zeta-Jones) comes into a small town
to gather information for the Nazis, blinds everyone with her looks,
manipulates them to her bidding while everyone runs around suspecting
everyone else but her of undercover nefariousness. Yes, it really is
that derivative. It's a plot that could have been lifted lock, stock
from a hundred TV movies produced from 1960 until 1980, but tellingly
probably none since.It's obvious that a lot of thought has been put in to casting as every
character is perfectly shaped to match his respective character from
the original series, and every one really tries to do as good a job as
possible. Admittedly Bill Nighy is incapable of playing anyone other
than Bill Nighy but it works as bumbling Oxford boy Sergeant Wilson,
Toby Jones is almost indistinguishable from Arthur Lowe as Captain
Mainwaring, Tom Courtenay does a fair Clive Dunn impression and Gambon
was born to play Godfrey. But casting alone does not a film make.At its core, the original Dad's Army series was little more than a
bunch of men in a church hall bickering with each other, the different
character's unique and exaggerated qualities carefully weaving a
different angle into the argument and comedy as a whole. That can, and
very successfully did, work for thirty minutes, but clearly it's
another thing entirely to treble the running time and expect it to
still function at the desired level. So the writers, as is customary,
took the whole thing out of its comfort zone with a more (supposedly)
extensive plot. The problem is that the plot, script and dialogue are
all utterly dreadful. It is simply not funny, nor is it interesting. At
no point do you care one jot what happens to the characters or the
storyline. Stir in a complete lack of humour and you're left with a
hollow shell of a movie that drags along and leaves you feeling utterly
cheated. It manages to lack fun, pace, spirit and perhaps most
surprisingly of all, nostalgia.It's good that the home front's respective wives get some screen- time,
particularly Mrs Mainwaring who was never more than a sullen passing
reference in the series, but it still doesn't help.The film is littered with tired innuendos that are seemingly delivered
at times with embarrassment, and the occasional poorly timed moments of
slapstick are cringe worthy. It's telling that the outtakes at the end
of the movie are far funnier than anything in the film itself, although
most of the audience will have rapidly headed for the exit by then like
home fans fleeing a drubbing from a local rival.Is Dad's Army a missed opportunity or an inevitable disappointment?
It's difficult to care. Either way it's badly written, dull and simply
not funny.",100,2016

898,8.166666666666666,7.9,"From what little I've read of this film it was lucky to have been made
at all. Some very big talents had some very big egos and those egos
clashed repeatedly. Original director Anthony Mann was replaced by
Stanley Kubrick by Producer/Star Kirk Douglas among other clashes.But the result was all worth it. The stars all give top notch
performances, but the mark of a really great film is the memorability
of each individual in the ensemble. To give a few examples, Charles
McGraw as the sadistic trainer at the gladiatorial school, John Dall as
Sir Laurence Olivier's protégé, and John Ireland as Kirk Douglas's
fellow gladiator trainee are all memorable in the brief roles they
have.Kirk Douglas wisely opts for a straightforward interpretation of a hero
in the title role of Spartacus. He's a BC everyman, born into a world
which hadn't heard anything about human rights, he knows and feels he's
not just cattle. Catch the alternating scenes of Douglas and Sir
Laurence Olivier addressing the slave army and the Roman Army. Olivier
with his years of Shakespearean training coming across as the tyrant to
be, and Douglas in simple prose talking about the slaves fighting for
their hopes and dreams. Very effective.The plot concerns a revolt at a gladiatorial school which mushrooms
into a crisis for the Roman Empire. Political factions led by Olivier
as Crassus and Charles Laughton as Gracchus seek to use the slave
revolt to further their own ends. Laughton as always is a wonder. It's a bit of unusual casting for him
because his parts are usually those of very tortured souls. His
Gracchus is a sly rogue, but a decent man. One of my favorite movie
lines of all time is delivered by him addressing the Roman Senate where
he says he'll ""take a little republican corruption for a little
republican freedom."" Another sly rogue in the film is Peter Ustinov who won the first of his
two Oscars as Batiatus the owner of the gladiatorial school. Like so
many others I'm sure in those days, he's just trying to come out on the
winning side when doing so could be a life or death situation.Jean Simmons as Varinia, beloved of Spartacus, has the only woman's
part of any substance. But when was Ms. Simmons bad in anything. One of
the most underrated and under-appreciated actresses in the history of
film.The lessons about man's desire for freedom and to control his own
destiny are eternal and valid. And this film will be also.",184,1960
899,13.5,7.3,"I have no background in the military, but I would love to see a review
of this by someone who does, preferably by someone with experience with
drones. The message of the movie is that one certain loss of innocent
life outweighs 80+ potential innocent lives lost. Nonsense.If you scan youtube videos about ISIS, terrorists, etc. you will see
Muslims constantly attacking the US and UK for killing ""hundreds of
thousands"" of people in Iraq and Afghanistan while defending the
Taliban, ISIS, and terrorists for merely killing thousands--maybe tens
of thousands tops. But of course that's not a valid argument to just
cite numbers killed. The issue is intention: are the US and UK
targeting--intentionally--innocent people? No. They are targeting
military targets. Do innocent people get killed, either by mistake or
by being too close to the bad guys? Absolutely. Is this a good thing?
No. But the other side--Taliban, ISIS, terrorists--intentionally target
innocent people. It's not a mistake, it's a strategy. And that is the
moral difference. If you don't see that difference, this is the movie
for you.I do know that the US military academies have courses in ethics. Why?
Because they don't want their officers wondering about the ethics of
following an order. ""Do I pull the trigger?"" the drone operator
wonders I think in real life he (and she, his partner) would have been
either court martialed or relieved of duty and sent to Nome Alaska to
count seals for a few years. The time to debate right and wrong is not
when you're about to pull the trigger, it's before you decide to join
up and take an oath of allegiance and obedience. Helen Mirren is a great actress. But she is in her late 60s. I think
you would be hard pressed to find ANYONE in their late 60s in any armed
forces in the US or UK. The character she played would probably be in
their 40s, if not younger. Same with Rickman's character--he should
have been maybe in his 50s. So that part is simply unrealistic. And of
course that takes away from whatever realism the movie tries to
achieve.Let's go back to WW II. Does anyone in their right mind think that
there was 1% of the hand- wringing you see in this movie about
decisions to bomb Hamburg, Dresden, Tokyo, or Nagasaki? It's
unthinkable. Does anyone know of any bomber pilot who thought to
himself when he was over the target ""Oh, one of my bombs might
inadvertently kill an innocent person""? That's just silly. And the
British as the big ditherers? Really? Let's run some history back: the
Luftwaffe is on a raid against RAF bases. One of its bombers didn't
drop its bombs on the intended target. So they dropped them on a suburb
of London, not to bomb London per se, but just to lighten their payload
so they could return to base. The British response? The entire Bomber
Command set out the next night to bomb Berlin. That annoyed Hitler just
a little bit, and thus we have the birth of the London Blitz. Another gratuitous feature of the movie is showing females as
sentimental softies. The female minister in Whitehall doesn't want to
kill an innocent person under any circumstances. The drone operator in
Nevada cries when the little girl is killed. I'm not sure if the
director wanted this message to come across: ""You can't count on women
when it counts."" But that's the message. I'm not sure if this is true,
but I do know that if I were depending on the female soldier next to me
to pull the trigger to save my life, I wouldn't want her to get all
teary and weepy because she was thinking about the family of the guy in
her sights. I'd want her to pull the trigger as quickly as she could.So basically this is an unrealistic anti-war propaganda piece. Well
done, yes. But it presents a false dichotomy and is unrealistic on
several levels. And of course we don't see the ""enemy"" debating any of
these issues at all. Maybe that's the movie that should be made--the
hours of debate and hand-wringing that went on in extremist HQ before
the November Paris massacre. I'm sure they were all heart-broken that
they had to kill 130 innocent people to achieve their military goal

epic tale spun out for 127 minutes. I was surprised by the honesty of

employees, the minor league baseball team he played for and finally his
campaign to NOT be elected mayor. Other candidates spend millions to get
elected; why not spend millions to convince people not to elect you? It's
also interesting to see the reactions of his friends (especially Candy) to

905,5.0,7.2,"""Yours Mine And Ours"" is one of the best ""family films"" of the 1960s.
(Very) loosely based on the real-life story of Helen North, a Navy
widow with eight children, who married Navy career man Frank Beardsley,
a widower with ten children of his own. Lucille Ball bought the rights
to Mrs. Beardsley's book ""Who Gets The Drumstick?"", co- produced it,
and took the starring role of Helen North. For those who know her
chiefly as a comedienne, this film will be a pleasant surprise. For not
only does she have the opportunity to indulge in some of the slapstick
she is famous for, she proves conclusively that she was an excellent
dramatic actress as well. Moreover, she can switch abruptly (and
seemingly effortlessly) from comedy to pathos, sometimes in the same
scene! Henry Fonda takes the part of Frank Beardsley and gives it both
dimension and strength. As his bachelor friend, Van Johnson is a
welcome presence, as is Tom Bosley as a sardonic doctor. There is also
a hilarious performance from Louise Troy, as Frank's date early in the
story. The kids are well cast and include future notables Tim Matheson,
Suzanne Cupito (who grew up to be Morgan Brittany), Mitch Vogel and
Tracy Nelson. A good deal of the plot involves the mutual dislike most
of the kids have for their step-siblings, but a great deal of charm is
present as well. Aiding the production is a nice score by Fred Karlin,
a lovely song ""It's A Sometimes World"", and handsome San Francisco
location photography. A remake has just been completed and will be
released around the holiday season, but it's not likely to top this
one. Incidentally, if you read the original book by Helen Beardsley,
you will most likely come away with a far different picture of the
Beardsley family, one which may not have transferred as well to the
screen. This may also explain why there is no mention of the book as
the story source in the movie's opening credits.",111,1968
906,11.2,5.7,"As slow-burns go, Fred Walton's mysterious catholic-bounded thriller
takes the cake with its minimal and sombre treatment. It's one of those
progressive and morally hounded plots (from William X. Kienzle's
novel), which is a puzzle to decipher, as you find yourself also
personally getting involved with the brooding investigation with
realistic characters. Some of the scheming is a bit hard to swallow,
but for most part it's smartly penned (by Elmore Leonard and Fred
Walton) and the low-key approach seems to make you concentrate on the
lyrical waxing (especially on those commitments to the priesthood and
the self-doubting). However the pacing seemed to plod a bit too much,
where some monotonous patches seemed to lose focus. Two stalwart figure
heads; an impressive Donald Sutherland and equally so Charles Durning
are engagingly strong. Sutherland has a sincere presence about him,
that even if he looks half-asleep. He's still watchable. Josef Sommer
and Belinda Bauer offer able support. Walton's direction is slickly
presented, but feels shapeless and dry. At least he did construct a
subtle, startlingly dreary atmosphere and the music score etches out a
placidly haunting vibe. The violence happened mostly off-screen, but
managed to leave a chilling mark and the Detroit setting complements

too often. lol) Anyway, I was looking forward to this sequel. I haven't
been this excited about a movie since the Harry Potter series. I rushed
my husband so we could get to the movies 30 minutes prior to showtime.
I expected a crowd, but when we arrived it was quiet. Evidently not
everyone was anxiously awaiting this film. I thought the movie started out a little slowly, but it was funny and
heartwarming. People in the theater were laughing and clapping and
genuinely enjoying it. We enjoyed it too. Did some parts feel forced?
Yes. Was it more of the same from the first movie? Yes, but I loved
that about it. When the 1st movie ended, I wanted to know more about
the characters and their lives. This movie allowed that to happen. I
loved that they were able to bring back the old cast. (There is nothing
worse than seeing a sequel with different actors.) I loved that the
characters were just the same as before, only a little older. This isn't a film to change your worldview, but it is fun for
entertainment. I'm looking forward to being able to buy it blu-ray, so
I can watch it again and again.",94,2016

I overheard in a bar drew me to this, and thank you nameless stranger
with impeccable taste! This is one of those sci-fi flicks that comes
along every once in a while that actually has something to say without
overuse of CGI and genre tropes.I knew almost nothing about Midnight Special going in other than said
comment, and I highly recommend you try to do the same. Therefore I
will be as brief as possible to avoid spoilers.Roy (Michael Shannon) is on the run with his 8 year old son Alden
(Jaeden Lieberher) from a religious cult that worships the boy as some
sort of messiah. Also in pursuit are the FBI and NSA, who are
investigating several strange phenomena connected with the child. Roy
enlists childhood friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton) to help them get to a
specific location on a specific date, the reasons for which are unclear
but may involve some sort of otherworldly or cataclysmic event.The comparisons with Starman (1984) and Close Encounters of the Third
Kind (1977) are apt, but this is very definitely a different movie
altogether.The actors are uniformly excellent, especially Michael Shannon, who
gives another intense and believable performance as a man who would do
anything for his son. A bit has been made out of how the movie ends, but personally I found
it a powerful emotional pay-off that I could feel in my chest, possibly
due to the nostalgic feeling this film evokes.In conclusion, go see it. A thought provoking sci-fi drama with a story
to tell. A good one at that.",112,2016
915,11.8,7.3,"Once in a while a movie comes along that is a gift for an actor. It is
like a golden opportunity that has been given to them, but there is a
catch they have to deliver. Three actors were given that opportunity
in State of Grace: Ed Harris, Gary Oldman and Sean Penn. All three
deliver performances that easily merit a Best Actor Oscar, but it is
the chemistry between Penn and Oldman that issue forth true gold.
Oldman completely and utterly loses himself in the role of Jackie
Flannery, a small-time Irish gangster that happens to be the younger,
impulsive, reckless brother of the head boss of the Irish mob in Hell's
Kitchen, Frank Flannery. Frank is brokering a deal with the Italian
Cosa Nostra that will result in a major windfall of money and power for
the much smaller gang of Irish mobsters. Frank is one of the only
people who seems to understand how important this deal is, while the
rest of the gang bristles against the direction of the much more
powerful and organized Mafia. Every time it looks like the deal will go
through, some member of Frank's gang does something stupid to insult
the Italians, and each time this happens Frank is called upon (by the
Italians) to do their retribution upon his own people.In the midst of this very dangerous situation enters Terry Noonan (Sean
Penn), Jackie's best friend from childhood who is now a cop and
undercover with the directive to do no less than take down Frank's
entire gang. In the beginning Terry seems eager to do his job, but as
the reality of what he must do comes crashing down he is torn between
his love for his old friend, and his duty as a policeman. This is
further complicated by the fact that Jackie's sister Kathleen (Robin
Wright Penn) and Terry were childhood sweethearts. As Terry renews his
relationship with both Jackie and Kathleen he begins to lose his
identity and his soul as he is torn apart by the things he must do as a
policeman, what he sees being done by Frank and his gang, and his
deepening relationship with Kathleen.Oldman delivers an explosive performance and he seems to become even
more unhinged and unpredictable each moment that he and Penn spend
together. The true beauty of his performance is the fact that we know
how intelligent Oldman is; yet he is totally believable as this
half-witted madman who is rushing towards his own demise. It is Penn
though that has the heavy lifting to do, because he doesn't have the
luxury of hiding behind the frenetic machinations that Oldman's
character does. You actually feel pain as you watch Terry get in deeper
and deeper, drinking more and more, sleeping less and less, losing his
direction and his mind.The music by Ennio Morricone is haunting, brooding and electrifying;
perfectly suited to the evolving story on screen. As we watch Terry
betray his friends and himself, it seems as if pieces of him actually
float away, carried on the wings of Morricone's music. Robin Wright
Penn also delivers as a young woman who is desperately trying to escape
the mean streets of the Kitchen, the violent world of her brothers, and
her meager upbringing. She also underestimated what being with Terry
would mean, especially after learning Terry's true identity. She is
sucked back into what she has tried so hard to become free of, and must
watch as her family and Terry disintegrates.The entire movie is set upon a collision course between Terry and
Frank, and when they finally collide, director Phil Joanou films it
almost like a dream sequence. The power of this film is how it manages
to so vividly portray one man's attempt to finally confront his past
and his own character flaws. All of us have demons and we promise and
strive to finally confront them, but do we ever? Facing our fears is
one thing, but the true measure of a person's character is how we
perform when that fear stares into us, face to face. Here, Terry comes
full circle and finally confronts the demons of his youth, and the
showdown might cost his life.Watch this film for the terrific performances of all the lead actors,
for the fantastic music, the frenetic action, and the moving drama, but
watch it also to ask yourself, what are your demons, when will you
finally face them and what will happen when you do?",134,1990
916,11.8,7.5,"A plea from a dead noblewoman propels Sherlock Holmes towards a
confrontation with a phantom murderer known as THE SCARLET CLAW.Holmes & Watson are faced with a real thriller in this moody,
atmospheric little film set in Québec. The villain is particularly
nasty--a glow-in-the-dark fiend who savagely rips out the throats of
its victims. This just might be the case which changes Holmes'mind
about the reality of the supernatural...As ever, Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce are perfect in their roles, like
two favorite old uncles, eccentric and a bit crotchety, that one still
welcomes to one's fireside. Rathbone is ever the cerebral gymnast,
making deductions which sometimes lead him straight into danger. Bruce
is a bit more lively this time, getting to indulge himself a bit with
an extremely humorous inebriated scene.A sturdy cast of character actors make up the very frightened
inhabitants of the bog-girded village of La Morte Rouge: Paul Cavanagh
as the occult-studying peer; Ian Wolfe as his alcoholic butler; Arthur
Hohl as the brutal innkeeper; Kay Harding as his unfortunate young
daughter; Gerald Hamer as a nervous postman; Miles Mander as a
terrified old judge and Victoria Horne as his disquieted housekeeper.With the war against the Axis still continuing at the time of

Canada.This film follows SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SPIDER WOMAN (1944) and
precedes THE PEARL OF DEATH (1944).",74,1944
917,11.5,7.4,"There is an ironic point about the production of SHE WORE A YELLOW
RIBBON immediately after FORT APACHE. Most critics agree that Col. Owen
Thursday, the martinet commander, is based on General George Armstrong
Custer, and that the massacre of his command due to his own pig
headedness is the battle of the Little Bighorn. But SHE WORE A YELLOW
RIBBON begins with that moment in the summer of 1876 when the entire
frontier was nervous after word came of the destruction of Custer
forces. The historic continuity (which is amazingly consistent, despite
minor anachronisms) is shown early when Captain Brittles, visiting his
wife's grave, mentions to her the death of Captain Miles Keogh at the
Little Bighorn. Historically this is correct. Keogh, a hero of the
American Civil War, served with Custer's Seventh Cavalry and died with
his commander and fellows. In fact, the only ""survivor"" of Custer's
forces at that disaster was Keogh's horse, ""Commanche"".Captain Brittles has served in the American cavalry for thirty years.
He was one of those soldiers who held higher rank in the Civil War with
a ""Brevet"", but in the cutbacks in the army following the war (Custer
went from brevet major general to Lt. Col. in the regular army)Brittles
had to be satisfied with the rank of Captain. His wife and children
died (presumably of some epidemic illness at the post - they are buried
nearby). His old orderly from the war, Quincannon (Victor McLaglen) is
still serving him. But he is facing a crisis. His thirty years means
retirement, unless the army decides to promote him to Colonel. Despite
the debacle in Montana, it is not too likely that the politically
unconnected Brittles will get the promotion his fine abilities deserve.So we are watching an old soldier slowly fade away in this film.
Brittles is aware he has days before he is to leave (unless a promotion
turns up), and he has to try to keep the hot blooded Indian braves,
impressed at what they just saw Crazy Horse and the Lakota forces
accomplish, go on the warpath. He also has to keep his two most
promising young officers (John Agar and Harry Carey Jr.) concentrating
on their careers rather than fighting over Joanne Dru. He is worried
too for Sgt. Quincannon, who is likewise going to be leaving the army a
few days after Brittles. Will Quincannon's drunken, roistering ways
ruin his chances to maintain his pension? And he has to keep an eye on
the suspicious behavior of the local fort sutler (Paul Fix) is up to -
can he be running guns? Whatever he faces, he faces unflinchingly, and
his motto is never to apologize - it's a sign of weakness.For all the anachronisms listed on this thread, such as the 48 star
flag (in 1876?), Ford got the time and place perfect in what counts.
Note the fascinating relationship of Brittles and Sgt. Tyree (Ben
Johnson). 1876 was a crossroad year for the U.S. regarding the results
of the Civil War. In the negative, a questionable Presidential election
result was solidified when three southern states agreed to support the
Republican (Rutherford Hayes) over the Democrat (Samuel Tilden) in
return for the Federal troops being pulled out of the south and the
official end of Reconstruction policies benefiting southern
African-Americans. One can't deny that is still a stain in American
history (despite Hayes excellent handling of the Presidency
afterwords). But the former foes were finding less and less reason to
dislike each other, and more and more to admire the grit both sides had
shown. During the Civil War, Tyree was a Confederate Captain - he was
Brittles' equal in rank. Once the war ended, after a few years, he
joins the American Army and rises to the rank of Sergeant. Technically
he is not as high a Sergeant as Quincannon, who is Brittles' aide. But
Brittles constantly treats Tyree as a full equal, consulting him again
and again on how to move next when going out of the fort to confront
the Indian threat. The highpoint of this respect is when one of Tyree's
""soldiers"", ""Trooper Smith"" turns out to be a former Confederate
cavalry leader named Rome Clay, and dies of wounds in an action against
the Indians. Brittles and his men watch silently while Tyree and his
fellow southern soldiers bury Clay properly with his flag, the
Confederate one.In terms of relations between the whites of the North and South, SHE
WORE A YELLOW RIBBON is miles away from the confrontations of, say THE
PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND. There John Carridine's northern officer has
nothing but fanatical contempt for Dr. Mudd, whom he considers evil for
helping John Wilkes Booth. Until the end of that film, Carridine takes
a sadistic interest in making Warner Baxter regret his every move. The
events of THE PRISONER was from 1865 - 1869 (when Mudd finally returned
to Maryland). This is seven years afterwords.There are other little historical pointers. The rivalry of immigrant
groups is shown when Quincannon is facing rival Sergeant Hochbauer, who
openly dislikes the former as an overbearing Irishman (Hochbauer being
a German). There is the civilian clothes that are meant for Brittles
(complete with ""Muller cut-down hat"") that Quincannon ends sampling
(which leads to his hysterically funny fight with Hochbauer and the
other soldiers meant to take him to the guardhouse). Quincannon insists
he is not out of uniform (technically he is) but is simply dressed as a
retired gentleman should be. Yes, in 1876, that would be the dress of a
retired gentleman.I like this film. The characterizations of the all the actors are
strong, and Ford had great set pieces in it. Perhaps not as great a
film as THE SEARCHERS (which is more meaty and dark), but a top notch
Western all the same.",103,1949

Simple as that. Ben Johnson is superb - as ever, a much underrated
character actor.Someone mentioned the 'silly' title song. I have to disagree. I love
those amazingly long opening titles and the grandiose pomposity of the
theme tune and its voice-over. All moving into that classic opening
shot of Wayne like an immovable great rock on horseback and the
horizon. Probably (no definitely) my favourite opening to a movie.True to history - if it ever is then its by accident. But what do you

919,10.0,7.3,"They Were Expendable is John Ford's first Hollywood feature since his
discharge from the U.S. Navy and the same can be said for Robert
Montgomery. Both had served in the Navy and Montgomery in fact on P.T.
Boats. From the last presidential election we now know them as Swift
Boats. It's an unusual John Ford film because the usual heavy comedic
monkeyshines are rather subdued here. I'm thinking that John Ford
wisely decided that World War II being recently over, the country's
mood was joyous, but somber in terms of the heavy human cost.They Were Expendable has the benefit though of the American audience
knowing the ultimate victory. The story begins in the Phillipines in
1941 with Robert Montgomery as real life naval hero John Bulkeley,
renamed Brickley for the film, trying to convince the brass of the
usefulness of the P.T. Boat in combat, not just for scouting and
courier duty. Of course that experiment is cut short and the P.T. Boats
and their crews are rushed into some on the job experience.During the film MacArthur, you might recall Gregory Peck saying that he
was going to be evacuated from Corregidor by ""one of Johnny Bulkeley's
torpedo boats."" That scene is dramatized as a wordless Robert Barrat
plays MacArthur traveling on the boat commanded by John Wayne.Wayne is Montgomery's second in command of the P.T. boat squadron who
is not thrilled to be there. He'd like to be on at least a destroyer.
He gradually comes around though. He also gets a fling in the romance
department with Navy nurse Donna Reed.During that interlude John Ford had some of the crew outside singing
Dear Old Girl in a comic vein. Ford was never one to not let a good bit
of business die with one film. You might remember in Fort Apache and
Rio Grande there was some serenading done. And Donna Reed got serenaded
on her ""Hawaiian"" honeymoon with James Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life
with Ward Bond once again being one of the serenaders. I'm sure Frank
Capra would have conceded he stole that from Ford.The story is first and foremost about some very desperate American
armed forces who after Pearl Harbor were at the Japanese mercy. Pearl
Harbor had totalled our Pacific fleet and no supplies could get
through. Still the troops there fought on bravely, they were in fact by
geography expendable. Wayne and Montgomery give good but subdued performances. No do or die
heroics here, just a sobering reminder of a terrible beginning for the
Americans in the Pacific theater of World War II.",135,1945
920,10.333333333333334,8.0,"Howard Hawks initially wanted to reunite John Wayne and Montgomery
Clift who had worked so well together in Red River in his second film
with Wayne. Clift however was at the beginning of the slide that would
ultimately destroy him in seven years and said no. It was then that
Dean Martin was cast as John Wayne's alcoholic deputy. By the way if Clift had done the part it would have reunited him with
Walter Brennan also who is playing a very similar part to the one he
did in Red River in relation to Wayne.In the wordless beginning of Rio Bravo, Wayne while going into the town
saloon to fetch Dino, witnesses a cold blooded killing perpetrated by
Claude Akins. Akins is the no good brother of rich rancher John Russell
who keeps trying to spring Akins from Wayne's jail. He also brings in
some hired guns who bottle the town up.Both Howard Hawks and John Wayne absolutely hated High Noon and made
Rio Bravo as their answer to it. This sheriff doesn't go around begging
for help from the townspeople he's sworn to protect. He's supposed to
be good enough to handle the job himself with some help from only a few
good men.Dean Martin said that the Rio Bravo role for him was one of the most
difficult. At that time he was playing a drunk on stage and was not yet
into the substance abuse problems that beset him later on. But turns in
a stellar performance.This film marked the farewell feature film performance of Ward Bond who
took some time from his Wagon Train TV series to play the small role of
a Wayne friend who offers to help and gets killed for his trouble.
Fitting it should be in the starring film of his best friend John
Wayne.The only bad note in Rio Bravo is that of Ricky Nelson who is too much
the nice kid from Ozzie and Harriet to suggest being a young gun. But
Rio Bravo marked the first of many films Wayne used a current teenage
idol to insure box office. Later on Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Bobby
Vinton all the way down to Ron Howard in The Shootist brought a younger
audience in for the Duke. James Caan who played the Ricky Nelson part in El Dorado was much
superior to Nelson. Then again, Caan is an actor. But I will say that
Dean and Ricky sung real pretty.When you hear Dean singing My Rifle, Pony, and Me in the jailhouse, you
might recognize the same melody from Red River as Settle Down. Dimitri
Tiomkin wrote it and Dean recorded it as well as the title song for
Capitol records. At Capitol Dino did mostly ersatz Italian ballads, it
was what he was identified with. When he switched to Reprise, Dino
started doing far more country and western and it really starts with
the songs he did in Rio Bravo.Rio Bravo is a leisurely paced western, probably one of the slowest
John Wayne ever did. But Howard Hawks created some characters and a
story that hold the interest through out.",0,1959
921,12.0,6.0,"See, I hate that. I hate movies which can't resist the temptation to
spice real events up with invented love stories (Pearl Harbor, Captain
Corelli's Mandolin) or bogus mysteries (Miracle at St. Anna), all while
pompously claiming to be ""based on true events"". I hate tedious
narrative frames which serve no purpose whatsoever apart for giving
viewers a modern setting to which, supposedly, they can relate more

people, including women and children. You'd think such an awful event

clichés (which here reach an almost toxic level) or making stuff up.
But race-obsessed filmmaker Spike Lee isn't really interested in that
terrifying war crime, but rather in the (fictional) story of four
Afro-American soldiers. See, there was an interesting movie to be made about the Buffalo
Soldiers; the problem is, using a real-life massacre merely as a
backdrop for an invented story is callous and tone-deaf. The Sant'Anna
tragedy deserved its own movie.Besides, the movie falsifies history, changing crucial circumstances

922,5.0,6.5,"Just released from jail, father and son Bill and Karl (played by real
life father and son Bob and Robin Hill) are patriarchs of a small crime
family. Their business and life in Down Terrace is plagued with
infighting. When Karl's estranged girlfriend claims to be carrying his
child, Karl's added priorities create tension amongst his immediate
family. Suspicions grow when the family believes there's an informant
in their midst that could send them all to prison for a very long time.This film is hard to categorize. Some have called it a British version
of Sopranos. While it is a story about a crime family, there's nothing
very ""gangster"" about them. They don't dress or look the part. The
three characters, Bill, Karl, and Maggie (Julie Deakin), Karl's mother,
look and act like a regular blue collar family. They're not
particularly convincing as gangsters (which may be why they're so
well-hidden). For a good chunk of the movie, I had forgotten they were
gangsters at all. Kind of like the TV show Roseanne, they bicker about
regular family issues. Heavy with dialogue and awkward situations, the
film plays almost like a comedic sitcom. It could have been about any
family business and it would have worked.There's realism and candor in the film's look and style. Characters
talk about everyday things. Characters are often irritable, unkempt,
and cumbersome. The camera is often hand-held, jerky, and frequently
focuses on the mundane. The dialogue is often quite sharp and funny.
It's certainly not glitzy like a gangster film.There's virtually no action until the latter half of the film.
Admittedly, some parts dragged. And, some parts are engrossing and
sentimental. Some parts take you by surprise. The film's focus on both
the mundane and the surprising moments is perhaps used to its benefit,
but can sometimes feel a little uneven in terms of pacing. When the
unexpected, violent moments hit, it reminded me that yes, this is
indeed a ""gangster"" film. This results in some great dark humor.
AdvertisementThe characters truly make this film. The dynamics between Bill, Karl,
and Maggie are realistic, funny, dysfunctional, and sad. Bob Hill is
particularly memorable as Bill, an aging father who is frequently
disappointed and putting down his son, Karl. Robin Hill expertly plays
off his real-life father Bob (who plays Bill) as the
constantly-frustrated Karl. Julie Deakin gives a complex, multifaceted
performance as Maggie, the loving, sometimes scheming, mother, who may
not always be as kind as she appears. The supporting cast, which
consist of thugs who often do not act like thugs, bring proper amount
of quirky, dry humor.Given the expectations one may have of the frequently popular gangster
genre, fans of that genre will likely be let down by this film while
missing out on this film's more subtler, deeper story about family
relationships. The initial pacing of the film may try some people's
patience. It did me a little. I wished the film hadn't really
characterized itself as a story about a crime family or a ""gangster
film"" because it really isn't. I think it perhaps hurts the film
somewhatit makes it seem less real, maybe more gimmicky. This is
closer to a family dramawith occasional violence thrown in. One may
mistakingly go in expecting The Godfather. I can see this film
re-imagined as a small crime story starring ordinary peoplesomething
akin to a Coen Brothers' film. These characters are odd, quirky, and
dark in that vein.I enjoyed the humor and the little surprises in this film despite the
fact that the plot didn't always keep my interest. Some parts are quite
banal and I sometimes wondered where the film was going. The film picks
up considerably on the second half and the film's theme seems to follow
the old adage that ""what goes around comes around."" By the end, though,
it was ultimately the memorable characters that remained with me long
afterwards.You can find more of my movie review updates on

part of the story is a difficult subject. There are wide ranges of
sexual abuses existed in the society. The percentage of crimes have
been reported is shamefully low. This movie presented the truth of it.I think the part how Bart (played by Greenwood) handled the situation
after he found out the truth was critical. It was humanly portrayed the
deep concern Bart had about Mackenzie's wellbeing. He did not pass
judgment on Mackenzie even she tried to seduce him earlier. He somehow
understood her behaviors. I would say this movie sieved the humanity
through a series of unfortunate events. The director had keen eyes to
present the positives from the negatives in life.Human beings are resilient and uplifting sometimes even in worst
scenarios. This movie would show you that at least. The director left

of manhood, who is troubled by questions of spirituality and god, while
at the same time coming to terms with his own sexuality, and how all of

watched this film within the past year and now I've seen it a half a
dozen times. It has so much going for it that I never tire from
reviewing. Michael Biehn stars in his most sadistic and downright mean
character to date and delivers a brilliant performance. William
Forsythe adds to the mix beautifully as usual. The cast overall meshes
perfectly as well. I'm not going to spoil any plot points but I will
say if you enjoy horror, thriller, and/or action films this one blends
the genres effortlessly so this might be for you. I like the gritty,
backwoods feel which umbrellas the atmosphere of the movie. This remake
sports the same director as the original so the intentions are not
lost. Finally there are great one-liners in the excellent script. One
warning though: If you are squeamish when in comes to uncomfortable
domestic situations and cold blooded murder then you might want to opt
for Dory or Madea.",98,2014

on this... I grew up in Belfast through some of the worst of the
troubles (and have been personally affected by the actions of both
loyalist and republican terrorists) and I have to say that for me this
film is pretty much it in a nutshell. The desensitising effect
mentioned by some of the other comments is precisely what happens in
real life; the fact that stuff blows up occasionally and every so often
someone gets shot dead eventually starts to just become part of the
scenery. I've lost count of the number of times I saw people walking
through Belfast stop in their tracks for a second or two as a bomb was
detonated nearby then just continue on their way. You learn to live
with it, and that's the real horror, which I think is something Clarke
portrays here with an extraordinary degree of empathy. Possibly some of
it's because so many of the places in the film were so familiar to me
but it really hit home in a way that no other film explicitly about
Northern Ireland has ever done for me.",0,1989

Sweetwater, a maximum security prison. He was convicted to a life
sentence due to a passionate crime. Iceman Chambers (Ving Rhames) is
the heavyweight champion, who lost his title due to a rape conviction
to ten years in Sweetwater. Of course they will fight against each

totally reminded me of Fort Polk, LA., firing ranges, maneuver areas,
waist-deep water and all. The movie was fairly authentic and the
characters similar to those same ones at my AIT in 1974. The difference
between the Tigerland year, 1971, and mine of 1974 is all the drill
sergeants and instructors knew they weren't going back to Vietnam, as
it was pretty much all over, so training was very relaxed - not a
challenge at all. That was the precursor to all our troubles in the 70s
and 80s, which I know for a fact as I stayed in until 2004. I never
heard anyone mention ""Tigerland"" but the Army did have realistic
Vietnam training villages at different bases across the U.S. Vietnam
Vets tell me that up to 1972 Basic & AIT could be pretty rough and
rugged, because the trainers had been there and were mandated to train
Vietnam-bound men those skills to make it, although that was not always
the case. Both a drill sergeant at Polk and later one of my Vietnam Vet
NCOs, when we had become instructors at a basic training brigade at
Fort Bliss, told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready

movie rates high.",101,2000
933,6.75,6.5,"This movie is second of Pasolini's so called 'Trilogy of Love' (Il
Decameron, I Racconti di Canterbury, Il fiore di mille e una notte;
1970-1974). All these movies are quite specific, there are said not to
be that provocative or intriguing. They are greatly influenced by the
fact that while directing them Pasolini was contented because of his
intimate relationship with the 'innocent barbarian', actor Ninetto
Davoli. It is also said that in 'Trilogy of Love' Pasolini became
resigned to the present time world by escaping to the past. However I don't think it's true. In these movies, Pasolini introduces
to the audience an incorrupt world where people don't care about
'material aspects of life', they try to live at the full stretch, they
seek love and, of course, sex and they do not respect 'the repressive
limits imposed by religious and bourgeois morality' (Gino Moliterno).
This is probably why Pasolini later declared that these three films
were most ideological of his career (in his famous and long interview
with Massimo Fini). I suppose Pasolini tried to confront such
'primitive' world with the world he had lived in and which he had hated
so much (this confrontation is present all the time, especially by the
contrast between the love and the death, by the contrast between the
first tales, in which the human naked body dominates, and the last two
tales in which pursuit of money causes death and perdition. Because of
such end it is also suggested that I Racconti di Canterbury are very
close to Pasolini's disillusioned last movie, Saló).It is common to hear that Chaucer must have rolled over in his grave
after this movie was released. But if you try to understand The
Canterbury Tales in the context of Chaucer's attitude towards love in
his (other) literary works, you will probably find that Chaucer would
resemble to Pasolini alias Mr Chaucer ends the film with writing 'Here
end the Canterbury Tales, told for the mere pleasure of their telling,
Amen'.",111,1972

Steven Soderbergh movie but, I felt, the whole thing had been done in a

friend, Matt Damon in this case. Terrific pace, involving and
surprising. That's more I can say about most movies but The Informant

too aware of the intention. Matt Damon is a good actor but his acting
is still too much of that, acting. I couldn't forget it was him, not
for a moment. No matter how much extra pounds he had put on, the
terrible hair do, the suits etc. It all felt like the dress rehearsal
for something that wasn't quite there yet. I longed for Alec Guinness
in that part. Visibly invisible. The story is so outrageous, with
bumbling, sentimental FBI agents that couldn't see through this man
until it was too late, is a pill hard to swallow and yet, we're told,
the whole thing it's true. I suppose that the Marvin Hamlisch score was

941,2.6666666666666665,6.2,"The funniest movie for at least a year! Sacha Baron Cohen at the top of
his game. Rude, crude, filthy, but absolutely hilarious with numerous
laugh-out-loud moments. So many laughs in fact that I found myself
wiping away the tears from laughing so much. It certainly helps if you
are a Sacha Baron Cohen fan because he is politically incorrect and his
humour is guaranteed to offend anyone who is sensitive to issues like
AIDS, religion, sexual abuse and the disabled. Of course comedy is so
subjective that you mightn't find any of this funny but I had such a
fun time, I cannot wait to see it again to check out the jokes I might
have missed out the first time around from laughing too much. Norman aka Nobby (Sacha Baron Cohen) is an English football hooligan
who is happily married to Lindsey (Rebel Wilson). They live together
with their nine children in Grimsby in the north of England. He has a
brother, Sebastian (Mark Strong), whom he hasn't seen for 28 years as
they were separated when their parents died. What Nobby doesn't know is
that Sebastian is a top MI6 agent who doesn't reveal his identity. He
is on a case where is attempting to prevent the assassination of
humanitarian, Kate (Penelope Cruz) when Nobby spots him and
inadvertently causes him to kill the director-general of the World
Health Organisation. With only Margaret (Isla Fisher) in the operations
room advising him, Sebastian must rely on his brother to help him catch
the real perpetrators of the crime. There's plenty of gross out humour on display ranging from an elephant
bukkake scene to Nobby sucking out the poison from his brother's
scrotum. Other standout funny scenes include a case of mistaken
identity when Nobby masquerades as his brother to obtain vital
information and Nobby searching for Sebastian in a spa therapy centre.
And if you like celebrities being lampooned, people like Bill Cosby,
Donald Trump and Daniel Radcliffe are fair game for the jokes that are
heaped upon them.Not only are there laughs aplenty but there are also exciting sequences
that would please action enthusiasts. The point of view scenes that
help Sebastian with locating his targets might be frenetic but they
inject variety into the typical chase scenes. There's even a touch of
sensitive family bonding scenes when Nobby and Sebastian recall what
they got up to during their childhood. Although the flashback scenes
are helpful in providing their adult lives with a backstory, they do
occasionally encroach into the comedy and action territory.The people of Grimsby were apparently annoyed with the depiction of
their town but what is a Sacha Baron Cohen film without a little
controversy? The run down appearance of the town and hooliganism
representing the townsfolk add a lot to the comedic appeal of the film.Supporting actors like Isla Fisher and Ian McShane don't get much of a
look in because ""Grimsby"" truly belongs to Baron Cohen and Strong. One
could say that Baron Cohen is typecast as the unintelligent Nobby but
he plays these sorts of characters so well. Strong is more of the
straight man to Baron Cohen's bumbling fool but it's the situations
they find themselves in that promote the laugh factor. ""Grimsby"" is known as ""The Brothers Grimsby"" in America. The film could
be called anything and it wouldn't matter for it's the material that
makes it so much fun. This is one of the best gutter humour movies ever
released and definitely worthy of repeat viewings if you're a fan of
this type of comedy, and especially if you appreciate Sacha Baron
Cohen's brand of humour.",83,2016
942,9.666666666666666,0.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. As a devotee and lover of the
cinematic art form, I tend to focus on the positive elements of films,
and maintain a near reverent respect for filmmakers who engage in
personal projects. Because of this, I typically avoid labels such as
""bad"" or ""good"" and instead focus on the experience. Unfortunately,
this latest from writer/director Angelina Jolie (billed for the first
time as Angelina Jolie Pitt) has delivered a prolonged experience of
monotony and misery that can only be described as bad. Or awful. Or
even beyond awful.It's based in the mid-1970's and filmed on the island of Gozo in Malta.
The setting is stunningly beautiful, and cinematographer Christian
Berger captures the essence of this unique spot with naturalistic
lighting and plenty of wide shots of the rocky beaches that provide the
foundation for a classy and quaint inn run by Michel (Niels Arestrup, A
Prophet). Roland (Brad Pitt) and Vanessa (Angelina Jolie) are the
epitome of an unhappily married couple  though they are stylishly
dressed while driving their 1967 Citroen convertible.He is a writer who doesn't write and she is a former dancer who doesn't
dance. While he is not writing, Roland sucks down gin, beer and
anything else Michel will serve him. Vanessa mostly hangs out in the
room popping pills and watching a fisherman in a row boat. When they
are together, they rarely speak except to ensure we viewers understand
just how miserable they are  with a lousy reason that isn't explained
until late in the film. Mostly she bats her porn star fake eye lashes
while he sports a porn star mustache.A glimmer of hope emerges when a honeymooning couple takes the room
next door. Lea (Melanie Laurent) and Francois (Melvil Poupaud) seem
quite happy and enjoy spending time together in bed. We know this
because Vanessa discovers a peephole where she can take in the sights.
In what is probably the only interesting twist, Lea and Roland are soon
sharing peeps  a step that somehow begins the process of rebuilding
their relationship. Of course, that doesn't happen without many more
scenes of misery prior to the quite predictable finish.Angelina is clearly paying tribute to the 1950's and 1960's French
art-house films, but having two unlikable lead characters who can't
stand to be in the same room never allows the viewers to connect 
though she seizes many opportunities to show off her exquisitely
rebuilt breasts. The film is entirely too long  and feels even longer
 as it squanders a real chance to explore the second stage of
marriage. The beautiful scenery and Gainsbourg songs don't come close
to making this a movie worth enduring.",0,2015

book since I consider Michael Medved to be one of the four or five
worst film reviewers of all time.""Hurry Sundown"" has been pretty much out of circulation in recent
years. I shudder to think how network censors would have butchered it
when it was broadcast on TV; anyone who saw it that way saw a different
movie. It is now finally available on a good widescreen DVD and also on
Amazon and Netflix streaming. I had been wanting to see it for a long
time, if for no other reason than it being one of the handful of
mainstream Hollywood films to earn a ""condemned"" rating from the
Catholic Legion of Decency.It wasn't nearly as bad as I expected; in fact I thought it was pretty
good. It held my unflagging interest for its almost two-and-a-half hour
running time, which is an accomplishment in itself; the worst thing a
movie can be is boring. Not a great film, but an entertaining piece of
Southern Gothic. I couldn't get that upset at the casting of Michael Caine. I've
certainly heard worse southern accents in movies. How about ""Gone with
the Wind"" in which two of the four leads were played by Brits (and
neither Leslie Howard nor Clark Gable even tried to sound southern)?
Caine looked and sounded tentative in the opening helicopter scene
(maybe that was the first scene filmed) but got more comfortable with
the part as it went along. In many ways, Caine fit the role perfectly,
since his character was a self-absorbed philanderer just like ""Alfie."" People have scoffed at Burgess Meredith's racist judge, but let's face
it, folks  people like that really existed in the South back then (and
maybe still do; is that Arizona sheriff much different?). Was
Meredith's portrayal much more over-the-top than Ed Begley's in ""Sweet
Bird of Youth"", which won an Oscar? I got the impression that Meredith
might have been basing his character on George Wallace (the pre-1968
version), and he wouldn't have been far off. As for the poor having better sex than the rich, well that's one of
those clichés that just might have a bit of truth in it, especially
when the poor girl is Faye Dunaway. Were the black characters over-idealized? Perhaps, but that is the way
Hollywood handled race issues back in the civil rights era. See, for
example, pretty much anything starring Sidney Poitier. I don't remember
anyone trying to make a film of William Faulkner's ""Light in August,""
in which the central character is a mixed-race psychopath.""Hurry Sundown"" is a good choice when you want a nice juicy wallow in
southern decadence. The color photography is pretty good, as is the

952,9.666666666666666,7.0,"I think I've seen all the variations on a theme of this story, which, in
turn, is a variation on the Don Juan legend. Of all of them, I like this
one best.Colin Firth is a marvelous Valmont. Firth is a VERY subtle actor. Early in
the film, he pretends to be helpless in the water, unable to swim in order
to elicite a response from his victim,(Tilly), but when his actions do not
receive the response he expected, his face changes immediately. He is no
longer the smiling, charmer, but a man furious that his plan was thwarted.
These changes in expression happen in an instant. The alteration of his
features is absolutely chilling.It is, to me, far more effective to have the villian of the piece LOOK like
an angel, than to look like what he really is (Malkovitch).Annette Benning, with her delicate beauty and dimple certainly doesn't look
like the scheming, sexual predator that she really is.There is one scene in which Firth really does a virtuoso performance. He
dances with four women in turn. First, he dances with his elderly Aunt.
This lady still loves to flirt. He is graceful and charming and flatters
her outrageously. Next he dances with his 15 year old prey. Here he
cappers like a 15 year old, which delights and disarmes her. Next, Valmont
dances with Benning, his former lover. Here he is remote and aloof. It is
SHE who flirts with him! He withholds what she knows should be hers. THEN
he dances with the woman he has fallen in love with. He has a bet with
Benning that he can bed this married, pious lady. In this dance he is
sensual and genuine. SHE reacts with the most rapturous expressions and
movements I have ever seen on screen. Meg Tilly and Colin Firth dancing in
this sequence are breathtaking to behold.Because all of the feelings of the characters in Valmont are so beautifully
acted, Firth, Benning, Tilly and Balk are all believable and because you
believe in them you also feel their pain.Each character suffers because of decisions they have made, over and above
the seductions that do take place.A marvelous film that I recommend to those over 18. There are some
explicite scenes in this film that are too hot for young
people.",137,1989
953,11.0,6.5,"This is one of the best ""Bloke"" movies from the early 90's and whilst

made in the 90's called ""Masterminds"" and it was a PG variation on the
same theme, but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic for that
matter.So what's so special about this film? It's the comradre between the
main characters and the against all odds theme of the film. Sean Astin
is very likable and has starred in some of the most memorable films of
the 80/90's, particularly ""The Goonies"". He also went onto greater
things with ""Rudy"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy, but ""Encino
Man"" is a good trip down memory lane. Will Wheaton from ""Stand by Me""
lends nice support to the film and Andrew Divoff is a terrific villain.
Louis Gossett Jr sleepwalks in his role, but he does add some brevity
to the film, particularly his relationship with Astin's rebellious
nature.So how's the action? By today's standards, it's rather tedious and
cheap looking, almost like a TV movie, but the production values are
good and the violence is actually quite nasty for a film involving
school students. However, the director makes up for the limited budget
with some nicely suspenseful moments and well placed humor.So park your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly remembered action
flick, but don't expect Oscar material!",111,1991
954,4.5,5.5,"Out of all the reviews I have written thus far, this one may arguably
be the toughest. Not because Young Messiah is a particularly good
movie; it's not. I struggle because while it might be easy to lampoon a
movie for being amateurish, inept, casually racist, remarkably
insincere, thematically dubious and egregiously pandering; this movie's
greatest sin however is it's a bore. Clocking in at a sluggish one hour
and fifty one minutes, I constantly was asking myself if this film
might have been improved if they replaced all the supporting characters
with mannequins. Perhaps if Graham Chapman's ghost popped up and sung
""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"" there'd be signs of actual,
you know, life.The film starts with the young Jesus (Greaves-Neal) living in
Alexandria with his parents Joseph (Walsh), Mary (Lazzaro) and their
extended family. After drawn-out moments of pensive staring and one
half-hearted occasion of necromancy, the family decides to trek back to
Judiah since the infamous King Herod is dead. Then the family walks,
and walks, and walks until finally they don't. They stop in Nazareth,
then Jerusalem slowly realizing that their movements are being
monitored by Severus (Bean), a Roman centurion tasked with finding a
certain seven-year-old with a knack for miracles.The main source of attempted tension comes from Severus and Herod Jr.
(Bailey) trying to find the mythic child of Bethlehem. The film takes
great pains in making Herod as traditionally evil as possible complete
with effeminate, overly dramatic mannerisms, a testy anger and an
almost stunning lack of awareness. Sean Bean fairs a little better as
Severus by simply phoning it in as the bad guy with a complicated past.
Yet even his jaded, near expressionless presence can't make the film
exciting. The moments of ""chase"" are largely missed connections with
supporting characters pointing north and saying ""he went that a- way.""
Meanwhile Severus prattles on about Roman steel. We all know the story
of Jesus, or at least we know enough to assume he's not captured by
Romans at seven-years-old so why is this dull chase the centerpiece of
this dribble? At no point in time will a reasonable viewer think Jesus
is in any real harm so why the cloak and daggers BS?The secondary source of tension comes from Joseph's unwillingness to
speak to Jesus about his origins because of...reasons. What those
reasons are, we're never made privy to. Half-realized conversations
happen with such regularity that one would be hard-pressed to find
anyone's reasons for doing anything in this movie. Jesus on the other
hand seems to take things in stride, performing miracles, showing off
in front of rabbis and otherwise being the embodiment of Christ in
miniature form. That's great and all, but he's not exactly an
interesting character. Instead he's every ""the one,"" ""the special,"" the
superhero Metropolis needs,"" we've seen thousands of times before. I
understand Jesus's tale is the granddaddy of all heroes journeys but
this film approaches the source material with such a pitiful lack of
imagination that Jesus doesn't feel like a messiah but an X-Man.With a subject so revered by countless believers, I'm surprised just
how painfully conventional Young Messiah is. The film is adapted from
""Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt"" written by Anne Rice who injects
religious iconography into all her books with such regularity, that I'm
surprised she's not a nun by now. Brought to moribund life by director
Cyrus Nowrasteh, the cinematography and editing is film-school, senior
thesis level atypical. There are some moments approaching the ethereal
in the vein of music video expressionism, but then we're brought right
back into the heavy- handed pandering that's become a hallmark of these
kinds of movies.The best thing that can be said about Young Messiah is at least it
panders without fear-mongering or demonizing other groups. Movies like
God's Not Dead (2014) and Left Behind (2014) preach with such bluster,
that the only thing stopping them from being malignantly harmful is
their amateurishness. I long for the day when we expect more from these
kinds of movies other than them being benignly boring. It is possible,
if you're willing to sit through rarefied gems like The Tree of Life
(2011) or Au Hasard Balthazar (1966) or The Passion of Joan of Arc
(1928). Otherwise you may just have to get your spiritual fulfillment

this film... but it's difficult.The problem is... it's near perfect. It is clever and inventive in it's

enchanting... and importantly... not infested with formulaic Hollywood
nonsense.The actors do everything that is expected of them, (and more in the
cases of Sally Field and Tyne Daily), there is zero CGI... and the
swearing is limited (and confined) to the sort of swearing real people
engage in. Healthy, gutsy, robust 'effing' and blinding. Also... no
swords, elves, planets or vampires intrude on the fun. We all have our own preferences when it comes to entertainment I like
my music intricate and embracing, I like my novels to be difficult to
define... and I like my films to be addictive... (at least for the

958,4.333333333333333,5.9,"This is the story and journey of a lone man, Cord (played by Canadian
Jeff Cooper), who is in search of Zetan and his book of knowledge.
Along the way he meets many people and has to overcome several trials.The story was original conceived by Bruce Lee, with help from James
Coburn. In the meantime Bruce left for Honk Kong (Golden Harvest) to
make what would be his series of movies that would immortalize him.
This movie was resurrected after Bruce's untimely death.What would have been Bruce's role, as the blind mystic/martial arts
flute player with a bell on his toe, went to the universal Bruce Lee
role acquiring machine that is David Carradine. In David's defense he
does play 4 roles in this movie and is the saving grace of the movie.
Jeff Cooper painfully interprets Cord, the hero. He almost lacks any
emotion even when annoyed or angry his face is strangely serene and on
the verge of a smile. He obviously spent time working out, but little
to no time in a dojo. Also what's up with the hair ?? David's problem
lies in his ""martial arts"" skills and his fortune cookie kung-fu
babble. The movie seems like an extended version of the TV series that
David was in (Kung Fu). There are problems with this movie. Initially the movie was to take
place in the East (China, Thailand, etc) to correspond with the various
themes of the movie (Taoism, Zen Buddhism, etc). Instead the movie was
filmed in Israel. The landscapes and backdrops are at times
breathtaking, just out of place. This along with the crappy martial
arts choreography (think Dolemite) and the repetition of extras gives
the movie the feel of a Conan knock-off.There are also some nice cameos by Roddy McDowall, Christopher Lee and
Eli Wallach. The man in oil scene is priceless. Throughout all this if
one pays attention, one can pick up a lot of Bruce's beliefs and
philosophies. One can only wonder how good this movie would have been
if Bruce would have been able to make it. I highly recommend this movie
for fans of Bruce and the martial arts genre.-Celluloid Rehab",102,1978

960,9.75,5.9,"Having watched and mostly enjoyed (with the inevitable suspension of
disbelief) the sister film 'Olympus has Fallen' I had the chance to
watch this over in the states. Assuming another dose of suspension of
disbelief, I settled down to watch it.This film, despite its good lead cast appears to have left the brains
of plot and due process behind as it made the leap across the pond.Set in London which is gleefully smashed up within the first 30mins of
the movie along with most of the global heads of state it puts action
scenes over plot devices (not that I was expected anything else) but
there are some concerning portrayals of real life characters which
undermine any amount of nice explosions and gun-play.The heads of state are all archaic stereotypes of what we assume to be
the culture of each country rolled into one person.For instance, the Italian PM has a young 30-year-old-love who he meets
in secrete atop Westminster Abbey. The Canadian President has the
perfect family. The French President is conducting some kind of
important state business in a kind of renaissance launcher boat on the
Thames replete with Champagne (did he really use it to get from Paris
to London?) and the Japenese PM is stoically quiet, patient and
reserved until the moment when the Thames Bridge is blown up around
him. Of course the US President is portrayed as a hip, fashionable
humane and judicious man with none of these stereotypes (negative or
otherwise).This marks the first concern - outside of their own nation, Hollywood
really does not care how these cosmopolitan characters are portrayed -
indeed - entire nations are mercilessly the subject of stereotypical
derision as the hapless heads of state are killed in creative manners.
Not that I mind red London buses being the unprinted cue for 'this film
is set in London'.What happens next is even more incredible. Since the 'assassination' of
the British PM, with the exception of some kind of funeral planning
meeting early on, there does not seem to be any kind of UK government /
leadership / disaster management faculty left. Rather than employ
characters from real life counterparts like 'deputy PM' or 'Defense
Secretary' or 'COBRA' or indeed our intelligence services like MI5 the
film leads us to believe the the job of bringing order to this chaos
falls to a Chief Inspector who thinks that yanks is still an acceptable
term for our American cousins. (He is not even a Chief Constable though
confusingly he does have chief constable epaulet rank badges) of
London's Scotland Yard. Really - the entire intelligence and
counter-terrorism effort. (This would be akin to a police captain in
the WDCPD mopping up after a similar event took out the President of
the US, though we know of course in Hollywood this could never happen).We have Morgan Freeman as Vice President giving strong suggestions
(read: orders?) over some kind of skype thing to this Chief Inspecter
who enacts his word like some kind of servile unthinking amoeba.Even our army is portrayed by a portly old man wearing something from
the dad's army set who dares to suggest a military response but is
denied this by Morgan Freeman and sheepishly accepts this reprimand.At some point the President asks to be shot by Banning should he fall
into the hands of the terrorists. Of course as soon as this is heard we
know that the president is going to fall into the hands of the
terrorists and is undoubtedly going to be rescued again. This removes
any anticipation of plot from the film and leaves the rest of it as
mere action-porn than anything else.Other issues such as the NSA revealing that they have been spying on a
London address for ages and the mindless insertion of armed foreign
nationals on the streets of London are too numerous to mention.Should Aaron be re-elected for a third term in something like 'Paris
has Fallen' then I think I might have to go back to watching nature
documentaries on UK Gold to sate my action thirst. Beast hunting beast
in the great oceans would have more twists and turns than this film.A bland, obtuse and frankly disturbing revelation of how Hollywood
regards the rest of the world should be portrayed against the might and
absolute 'good' of the USA. How arrogant, patronising and disgusting.",99,2016

962,7.5,3.3,"Truth be told, then I made it no more than 30 minutes into the ordeal
that is also known as ""Poltergeist Activity"". Indeed, the movie was
just that unfathomably boring. I just simply gave up and threw the
towel in the ring out of sheer and complete boredom.I was initially lured in to watch this movie given that it was a ghost
movie with some poltergeist activity - hence the name, duh! But wow,
was this a swing and a miss. 30 minutes into the movie and still
nothing had happened, aside from a dysfunctional family consisting of a
father and daughter having moved into a new house and were just
stumbling about with any direction or meaning.I didn't even care one bit about any of the characters in the movie,
because they were showing as much charisma as watered down cardboard
cut-out characters would. And the dialogue in this movie didn't really
help promote the entertainment value either.As for the acting, well I didn't really see anything noteworthy, and I
am sure that it was the result of having nothing worthwhile to work
with in terms of script, direction and storyline. The actors and
actresses here just simply had nothing to work with.""Poltergeist Activity"" came and went without leaving a dent or even the
tiniest of scratches in anything. And I can honestly say that I have no
intention of ever returning to watch the rest of the movie at any time
in the future, because the movie just had nothing to offer.I am rating ""Poltergeist Activity"" a mere two out of ten stars, solely
because it did have some production value to it, at least. But when it
comes to it, don't waste your time, money or effort on ""Poltergeist
Activity"", because it quite simply just isn't worth it. It seemed that

964,7.5,5.3,"I'll be honest. I think if I hadn't seen this in cinema,with the lights
off, the loud sound system and the big screen, I would've given it a
lower score. If you saw The Forest earlier this year, you know what to
expect from The Other Side of The Door. The Good: I know a lot of peeps don't like her, but I think Sarah Wayne
Callies has a great presence and a naturalness to her performances that
I enjoy. She made for a believable mother, who had to make the kind of
choice no parent should ever have to. Jeremy Sisto is another actor I
like (remember him as the guy who got the arrows in his back in Wrong
Turn?) and the kid actress, while average, didn't annoy me and actually
appears in one of the better/scarier scenes in this movie. I also liked
that the location was India and the evil/dark presence was part of
their folklore. It was a little something new, that I hadn't really
seen in North American films.The Bad :Cliches, clichés, clichés! When for the love of Rice will they
stop using the tired old tropes of : -Ghost with hollow eyes and
stretched mouth (CGI of course) Look over there! Oops no, it's right
next to you! (accompanied with loud ass noise) -Parent is completely
absent from story for no reason, only to show up at the end. Sisto is
VASTLY underused in this movie, to the point where I wondered if there
was bad editing and he had scenes that were cut out. -Not following
your own rules! (Burn stuff and ghost goes away, but wait, nope!) -
Told not to do something or else. Does it anyway! -Witness the
supernatural. Interact with the supernatural. Denies it exists.I could go on and on, but nobody likes to read these days so I'll just
stop and say, wait for it on DVD and watch it to pass the time. The

966,7.666666666666667,6.2,"""Up the alley and down the street Fallon and Broom sell bones and meat.
Fallon's a butcher and Broom's a thief. And Rock's the boy that buys
the beef.""At the film's closing, Dr. Thomas Rock(Timothy Dalton)proclaims that he
has become a ghost story that frightens children and questioned how it
had gotten so far.A revisionist take on ""The Body Snatcher""(..a marvelous film produced
by Val Lewton), this film has Dalton portraying a scientist whose
skills in anatomy are unsurpassed thanks to his intense study of dead
bodies. The law prohibits Rock from using fresh corpses for his
research so all he has to use are rotted corpses brought in by grave
robbers or criminals hung or animals. He soon enlists the aid of
graverobbers Fallon and Broom(Jonathan Pryce and Stephen Rea)to bring
him fresh bodies for proper research not knowing they are supplying him
with victims they murder. Julian Sands plays Dr. Murray, Rock's
assistant, who falls in love with a prostitute named Jennie(Twiggy)and
discovers when he goes to see her how Broom and Fallon get their
corpses so fresh.The whole business of delivered bodies provides a special moral dilemma
within the story(..which worked quite well in ""The Body Snatcher"").
Also, the film is quite an indictment on the plight of impoverished
""squalor"" who lie slowly dying in the streets and alleyways or drift
slowly into the abyss of alcoholism. Director Fisher's camera doesn't
shy away from the less fortunate as the film seems to show us
first-hand their suffering. Dalton's doctor is actually the sympathetic
figure in the film in regards to his recognizing the poverty that his
colleagues and peers seem to either ignore or just care not to
acknowledge. He honestly desires fresh bodies so that he can make a
difference in the advancement of the medical profession moving it from
the dark Ages to the 19th Century. It's just unfortunate he has to
resort to paying graverobbers for specimens. But, the film does
recognize(..like in ""The Body Snatcher"")that Rock knew very well that
some of his specimens may've been attained beyond reasonable means.
Thomas' sister provides a detrimental problem to the furtherance of his
work as she believes his ways are the works of the devil. His wife is
also seen as immoral by the sister for she artistically portraits
anatomical charts of the human body. Others question Thomas' work as
well, specifically Prof. Macklin(Patrick Stewart, whose role and
character is underwritten)who wishes for his unusual methods to be
grounds for dismissal.The major moral crisis, though, comes when a deranged Fallon attempts
to murder Jennie and is sought after by Dr. Murray where Rock's illegal
researching in accepting bodies murdered might soon be discovered.
While he only wishes to advance anatomy to save lives, his accepting
murdered bodies is indeed considered immoral and unlawful.While the material of the film might seem familiar, considering it just
really feels like a remake of ""The Body Snatcher"" and is just difficult
not to think of the previous film while watching ""The Doctor and the
Devils"", Fisher's marvelous direction makes up for it. Unlike his
Hammer years, Fisher doesn't have to hold back. He isn't held down by
restrictions and can display the cruel realities of life such as the
squalor in the streets as the epidemic it was. The period
cinematography feels fresh and completely genuine. It is quite grim and
bleak which might put off many with no hope seemingly in sight for many
in this film. Fisher keeps the film, for most of the way, on the
dreaded streets so that we have a hard time looking away from the
truth.",93,1985
967,12.6,6.6,"First things first: I have to say I have never read Charles Dicken's book,
but after seeing this movie, I'll be stopping by the state library to pick
it up. This is a GREAT movie - enjoyable, moving, and historically
convincing. (My history teacher made us watch it to see what the French
Revolution (especially the Reign of Terror) was like.)After reuniting with her father, Dr. Manette (they had been separated from
each other for many years), Lucie Manette goes back to England, where she
meets a handsome stranger, Charles Darnay. Darnay is really Charles
Evremonde, a French aristocrat who disdains his vain and arrogant uncle
and
who runs away from France. They fall in love and marry. But there is an
English lawyer, Sydney Carton, who also loves Lucie. When Darnay returns
to
France to save his servant, he is thrown into prison and besieged by all
the
foolishness and speculation of the French Revolution. I won't divulge any
more of the story to you.but I have to say the ending is really, really
great. It's so moving that I can't watch it without crying at least a
little. (Yeah, I cried when we were watching it at school, and hopefully
no
one saw me.)For others who know the story, I can't tell you if the movie lives up to
the book, but I do think the movie is a very convincing depiction of what
happened during the French Revolution. Madame DeFarge, one of the
`revolutionaries' (ha!), embodies the spirit of the common people during
the
Revolution. She felt it was absolutely necessary to kill a lot of nobles,
even if they were innocent and had done nothing wrong. In the court
scenes,
we see how unfair the French tribunals are; defendants are barely given
the
chance to speak and they are convicted on little evidence and a lot of
speculation. (The film compares the French court to the English court,
which is infinitely more just.) We see the so-called anti-Revolutionaries
being marched to the guillotine.it's a very moving moment. The film works
very well because it doesn't lose any part of the story or the historical
background. They work very nicely together.To single out someone for acting, I have to commend the talented Chris
Sarandon, who played Sydney Carton and Charles Darnay. That must have
been
really hard to do, especially since Darnay gets everything he wants and
Carton doesn't. It's great acting. However, Sarandon manages to stay on
course and the results are wonderful. He manages to combine jealousy,
love,
and strength all in the same gaze.A WONDERFUL film.it gets your anger going, pulls on your heartstrings, and

beautiful, tuneful, and loads of fun. While it pokes fun at Hollywood
it also does so with great love. Little bits and pieces of Hollywood
lore find their way into this great film and it's a pleasure to get the
joke or recognize the real star they're referring to.The star trio is just perfect: Gene Kelly give a funny performance as
the hammy silent actor; Donald O'Connor makes the most of his ""second
banana"" role; Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the ingénue trying to break
into films. The three stars perform many memorable numbers, including Kelly's
""Singin' in the Rain"" classic; all three in the ""Good Mornin'"" number;
O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh""; and Kelly and Reynolds in ""You Were Meant
for Me."" The masterpiece however may be the ""Gotta Dance"" production
number with Kelly and Cyd Charissejust perfect. Also great fun are
O'Connor and Kelly in ""Fit as a Fiddle"" and ""Moses Supposes.""There are of course other production numbers, including the montage
that shows Hollywood's race to transition to talkies, a scene that ends
in the ""Beautiful Girl"" number featuring Jimmy Thompson. Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won an Oscar nomination and steals the film
in a classic comedy performance. Also good are Millard Mitchell,
Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno, King Donovan, Kathleen Freeman, Mae
Clarke, Julius Tannen, and Madge Blake.The great trick to this film is that while Reynolds is supposedly ""lip
syncing"" for Hagen, it's really Hagen's voice that Reynolds is miming
to as in the ""I Would, Would You"" number. The final miming act is Hagen
mouthing ""Singin' in the Rain"" is really Reynolds. It gets so confusing
you can't tell who is lip syncing whose voice.Lots of Hollywood lore retold in this film. Hagen's Lamont character is
a veiled reference to Norma Talmadge, who supposedly failed in talkies
because of her New York accent. It's also a reference to Louise Brooks,
whose talkie debut in The Canary Murder Case was all dubbed. When Kelly
screams ""I LOVE YOU"" it's a reference to John Gilbert in is talkie
debut flop. His Glorious Night. Kathleen Freeman's diction coach
character is a reference to Constance Collier, who returned to
Hollywood as a coach. And on it goes.A great film!",103,1952
970,9.6,7.2,"A gold-digging, or rather diamond-digging, ""dumb"" blonde, played by
Marilyn Monroe, and her singing gal pal, played by the vivacious Jane
Russell, provide mutual support on a love boat cruise, where they flirt
with, and woo, eligible and preferably rich, men, in this musical
comedy from the early 50's. The story is thin and nonsensical. But
that's OK, because the film's strengths lie in its comedic script, its
dazzling musical numbers, and the inclusion of the visually stunning M.
Monroe, as Lorelei Lee.Superficially, Lorelei ""seems"" like a not very bright ""babe"",
especially in some of her comments. For example, she counsels Russell's
character by saying: ""I want you to find happiness --- and stop having
fun"". But there is a subtle quality about Lorelei that suggests that
she may be smarter than she lets on. One wonders if Monroe, who was
quite intelligent and bookish in real life, was really acting in this
film, or just being herself.While there are several lively, and memorable, musical numbers, they
are all lead-ins to the lavish, eye-popping musical finale. On a stage
adorned in garish colors (orange, pink, and black mostly), a
breathtakingly glamorous Monroe belts out the popular song: ""Diamonds
Are A Girl's Best Friend"". Her singing (partially dubbed) is not quite
as credible as the performance of Carol Channing in the Broadway
version. Still, the film's finale is a cinematic spectacle, a veritable
feast for the eyes and ears. ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" is not a heavy
weight ""message"" film. It is instead a pleasant and entertaining bit of
fluff, where the emphasis is on fun, music, and glamour.",91,1953

dalliances --- what she finds out isn't pleasant. Preminger, whose
films usually feature women without virtues, gives Cannon the rare
opportunity to carry a film on her own and she's quite possibly

a most complex and provocative relationship between a young French girl
(Jane March) and a Chinaman (Tony Leung). The two lovers' attraction
towards each other are purely physical, but there are a lot of psychological
burdens and suffering that they can't break free from, since the two of them
are psychologically washed-up people who lives within the shackles of
society that they live in. At times they treat each other cruelly while at
times they treat each other with tender affection, yet we don't know whether
they feel true love for each other or not. That's where the story gets very
interesting and different.The sex scenes are indeed graphic, but by no means done in bad taste or just
for the sake of sex. The film is much more than about lust, it is about two
lovers who found refuge in each other's arms. Jane March and Tony Leung
gave great performances, showing the subtleties of conflicting emotions that
they had to endure. Beautifully paced storyline with great atmosphere and
soundtrack will make this a worthwhile movie experience. Very highly
recommended.",115,1992

Pearl Harbor. Thus, it's really not a war movie. Actually its more of a
soap opera with Burt Lancaster putting the make on Deborah Kerr and
Frank Sinatra having a fight with Ernest Borgnine and Montgomery Clift
having a tryst with Donna Reed, which brings me to the element of the
movie that I really liked: Donna Reed's character. In the movie Donna
Reed plays a prostitute who wants to earn enough money to go home, but
by the end of the movie circumstances have transformed her from cynical
prostitute to fiancé and bereaved victim who has lost her man, and for
whom things would never be the same. To me, this is what a good movie
is all about - powerful and compelling character development within the
context of a story that is credible and makes sense.",118,1953

""Gosford Park"" is because they misunderstand the point trying to be
made. Gosford Park wasn't made to focus on whodunit (if it was, why
would they tell you who did). If viewers think that Gosford Park is
""boring"" or ""confusing"" or even ""the worst movie ever"", it may be that
you're not willing to see what really is portrayed: the authenticity
and its story. The authenticity of Gosford Park is as close as it can
get to real life as it was back then as it can get. Experts who were
maids, butlers, or cooks themselves were constantly at the scene
criticizing the actors behavior and moves. Another main focus is the
story behind it. The brilliant story as well as excellent character
development are like no other: only Robert Altman could do a film such
as this. So, next time you see it (which I highly recommend that you
do), be PATIENT and actually be WILLING the enjoy the differences in
film-making, not just the kind of films you like.",131,2001

with less dark comedy moments.*incoming spoilers*This old bat gets sacked as a house keeper and as she leaves she gives
the family boy the ugliest doll since Chucky's last dump. Odd things
happen, paintings get ruined, foot prints (CLEARLY not belonging to the
boy) appear about the place. Mummy blames the boy. A baby sitter gets
killed. Mummy gets taken as a crack pot by daddy. Realise doll is
possessed. Doll goes whacko-Jacko. No bugger thinks to burn the stupid
thing from the start. Doll gets it's comeuppance. Evil spirit enters
boy.NOW!!! Why the mother spotted the paint foot-prints and doesn't know
her son well enough to realise they are flippin' square prints, ergo
NOT her son's, is a mystery. Why she insists on yelling at her son
about it rather than looking at the sodding doll two feet away (with
red paint all over it's feet) is another odd ball moment. Why, when she
decides it must be the doll, she locks it in a shed full of garden
tools rather than incinerating the bloody minded mannequin is stupid
move round 3. How this jerky badly animated lump of kindling manages to
overcome anyone enough to kill them is laughable. Why, when it advances
on mum at the top of the stairs with a baseball bat (and takes a week
to reach her) she simply slides down the wall to a convenient head
height for the doll, rather than launching a good hard boot into the
thing and making with the big legs out of there... who the heck knows.
All of the above with a couple of dozen other 'what the fekk are you
doing'? moments make this movie a face-palm mess from the start. 3 out
of 10 because the doll didn't fluff it's lines and they managed to find
the budget to make it in colour. Utter twaddle, but if you want to

might) just about do it.",90,2015
976,14.0,5.4,"Moore knew he was living on borrowed time so far as Bond was concerned. Way
too old, too slow moving and paunchy to be carrying a Walther PPK for much
longer. His Bond contract allowed him to make two other films during this
period - post OCTOPUSSY and pre A VIEW TO A KILL (that was to be his last JB
outing)Wisely perhaps, he chose this role as mild-mannered but wholly professional
Chicago psychiatrist Dr Judd Stevens, whose life hits a major rut after one
of his patients is stabbed to death - wearing HIS coat. Having no idea what
is going on for pretty much the entire movie Moore conveys Judd's plight
rather well I thought. As unlike anything Moore has ever done, he must deal
with finding himself simply in the wrong place for seemingly no
reason.Several things to like about this flick - IF you care to look. Art Carney's
turn as burnt-out but still cluey PI Morgens is a real gem of a performance.
When Moore admits he doesn't believe in guns, Carney counters, ""Yeah, well I
don't believe in Santa Claus, but each Christmas he still comes round."" The
brief scenes in his ramshackle office are really worth looking at
closely.Cop Steiger is a tad over the top as is his wont - give him any opportunity
to rave - he's in actor's heaven. Ron Paradi as mob boss Cortini puts across
one of the nastiest and inherently evil men you would ever wish to not meet

977,4.75,7.1,"Review by Ruby: If you are reading this, you have probably read the
background info about The Irishman Danny Greene and his Italian buddy
John Nardi who worked and broke the law many times over in the streets
of Cleveland throughout the 1970s. In addition to Greene and Nardi,
many of the cast members were familiar ""mob types,"" and testosterone
was practically flying off the screen in the midst of bravado,
fistfights, gunfire, and countless explosions. But there was an actual
story to follow also, so it offered more substance than much of the
drivel that manages to run in the theatres today.Even though they were gangsters, Greene and Nardi were surprisingly
likable charactersfor killers, that ismostly because of the
charismatic acting of the two leads, Ray Stevenson and Vincent
D'Onofrio. The supporting characters were interesting also, including
the talents of Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Steve Schirripa, Paul
Sorvino, Tony Lo Bianco, and Mike Starr.Interspersed with the actors' scenes were actual clips of film footage
from local newscasts of the day, which added authenticity and a
touchstone to the amazing story that unfolded in Cleveland some 30-40
years ago.I highly recommend ""Kill the Irishman"" as an action-packed, escapist,
period piece, featuring superior acting and excellent film editing. It
was a thoroughly enjoyable 100+ minutes!",106,2011

true to what Shakespeare wrote and was undoubtedly his vision, yet is
undeniably fresh and relevant and affecting, despite its Renaissance
setting. It feels more modern and current than the soulless bluster of
Baz Luhrmann's effort. Whosoever says Whiting and Hussey are anything
short of fantastic as Romeo and Juliet needs to reconsider how they
want Shakespeare acted. Do you want dramatic bluster and fist waving
(which Hamlet specifically cautions against) or true raw emotion and
feeling? These actors, mostly because they were so inexperienced,
couldn't be more natural and true to their characters every step of the
way. You truly believe that they are in love and it's a legitimate
love, no just ""crazy teens."" And the rest of the cast - Jesus H.
Christ! They're all fantastic. The Friar and Nurse were obscenely
perfect, becoming among the most endearing characters ever filmed, and
of course John McEnery is the best, most pathos-laden Mercutio ever,
all stage, screen, TV, etc. renditions included. Michael York is a
fabulous Tybalt, menacing, arrogant, headstrong, cruel, but ultimately
sympathetic. Tybalt is after all just a petulant child - he's no evil
tyrant, just a misguided bully, who certainly doesn't deserve to die. I
love that his killing of Mercutio is accidental and that he seems to
show remorse for it. Even the Prince is really damn good, with his last
lines leaving an absolutely chilling impression on the audience. All
are punish-ed! A must see.",138,1968
980,6.4,8.0,"Imagine turning out the lights in your remote farmhouse on a cold
night, and then going to bed. There's no need to lock the doors. The
only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. Sometime after
midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway. Moments later an
intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room.What makes this image so scary is the setting: a remote farmhouse ...
at night. Based on Truman Capote's best-selling book, and with B&W
lighting comparable to the best 1940's noir films, ""In Cold Blood""
presents a terrifying story, especially in that first Act, as the plot
takes place largely at night and on rain drenched country roads. It's
the stuff of nightmares. But this is no dream. The events really
happened, in 1959.Two con men with heads full of delusions kill an entire Kansas family,
looking for a stash of cash that doesn't exist. Director Richard Brooks
used the actual locations where the real-life events occurred, even the
farmhouse ... and its interior! It makes for a memorable, and haunting,
film.Both of the lead actors closely resemble the two real-life killers.
Robert Blake is more than convincing as Perry Smith, short and stocky
with a bum leg, who dreams of finding Cortez' buried treasure. Scott
Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, the smooth-talking con artist
with an all-American smile.After their killing spree, the duo head to Mexico. Things go awry
there, so they come back to the U.S., stealing cars, hitchhiking, and
generally being miserable as they roam from place to place. But it's a
fool's life, and the two outlaws soon regret their actions. The film's
final twenty minutes are mesmerizing, as the rain falls, the rope
tightens, and all we hear is the pounding of a beating heart.Even with its somewhat mundane middle Act, ""In Cold Blood"" stages in
riveting detail a real-life story that still hypnotizes, nearly half a
century later. It's that setting that does it. Do you suppose people in
rural Kansas still leave their doors unlocked ... at night?",134,1967

seeing this, I have to go out and rent that one.The characters on display here might feel a bit too distant and not
everyone will be able to find a character he can entirely sympathize
with, but that's what made it so intriguing to me. It's not showing a
rose-tinted world. And it is not afraid to go ways, that other movies
might have been. It's raw and sometimes feels like a documentary
(though it obviously isn't).Very good acting and a story that flows from start to finish, with no
(visible) flaw in the storytelling. Highly recommended",91,2010
982,4.0,7.1,"""A shattering conclusion."" ""The best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never
directed."" These are a couple of the tag line quotes that appear in the
trailer for ""Catfish."" The movie poster tells us ""Don't let anyone tell
you what it is."" Watch the trailer and it seems like this is going to
be the next ""The Blair Witch Project."" Really, go to You Tube and watch
it right now. I'll wait  What do you think? It looks suspenseful and
frightening, doesn't it? Well, it ain't, sister. The marketing
department for ""Hit the Ground Running Films"" did a number on twisting
this two-minute trailer around to make it seem like you are going to
see the next big documentary thriller. What you will see is a study in
social media and the human psyche that is using modern technology (such
as Google Earth, Facebook and texting) to bring the story together.""Catfish"" is a documentary by three aspiring filmmakers. The story
begins by introducing us to Nev Schulman who is the main focus of the
story that his brother, Rel Schulman, and friend, Henry Joost, are
producing and directing. Nev is a young, charismatic photographer in
New York City. One of his photos he had published made it all the way
to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This is where an 8-year-old girl
named Abby sees the photograph; she draws a painting of it and sends it
to Nev. As having been the father of an 8 year old myself, I could tell
something was rotten in Denmark from the quality of work this child was
producing.Nev and Abby start a pen pal relationship via Facebook. Nev befriends
Abby's entire family on Facebook and even talks to her mom on the
phone. He becomes close to Abby's older, attractive sister, Megan, and
starts having feelings for her over the phone. Hey, it happens. There
is an accurate scene where a nervous Nev calls Megan for the first
time. Within today's culture of meeting people online, it is exactly
how these phone calls play out. People meet online and text and e-mail
back and forth until the day comes where they exchange phone numbers
and there is an awkward human connection. It's a norm for this
generation and they will easily relate to Nev's nervous behavior while
tripping over his words when he is speaking to Megan.Nev and the filmmakers start putting the clues together from Megan's
e-mails. Through some detective work on You Tube and other various
sites they are slowly realizing that someone is playing them like a
squeezebox. They get the bright idea to drive to Michigan to confront
Abby, Megan and the rest of the family.This is where the movie trailer leaves us hanging. After a long trip,
the trio of filmmakers arrives at the barn by Megan's house in the
middle of the night. They peer inside the barn...and... andsorry I
can't tell you what it is. I have an agreement with a movie poster.
But, what I can tell you is that it's not some 20 year old standing in
the corner of a basement in an abandoned house in the woods. That has
been done before. It's not even startling, not in the sense that I
would expect it to be.The rest of the film spends its time explaining how Nev and his mystery
solving team react to their findings. If you pay attention (and, it's
pretty easy to do) you can pick up on where the movie was going.There was no big ""wow"" moment nor was there ""a shattering conclusion.""
It was simply people explaining their actions on why they did what they
did. At the end the audience is rewarded because the film's title is
explained. Trust me  the end does not justify the means.Should you see this movie? Only if you want a movie that has a lot of
build up and very little climax. It would fare better in a small,
independent movie theater rather than on Megaplex screens. In fact, I
could see a professor using this as a teaching tool in a Psychology 101
or Sociology 101 classroom. It made some valid points about how people
can manipulate one another on the Internet. The point is well taken,
because I certainly felt manipulated by the movie trailer.",87,2010
983,9.666666666666666,7.0,"'An Officer And A Gentleman' is a brilliant film with great performances
from Richard Gere, Louis Gossett Jr. and Debra Winger. Richard Gere
embodies
the character of Zack Mayo, a troubled young man who, due to neglect and
ill
parenting by a military father, signs up with the Navy to get some
direction
in his misguided life.Mayo's life is made even harder by the ball-busting Sergeant Foley (Louis
Gossett Jr.) upon his arrival at the barracks, and he struggles to find
his
place. However, he does find it in himself to stand-up to the overbearing
Foley and his own inner-demons and, during the course of the film, goes
from
being selfish, weak and undisciplined to considerate, strong and
determined.
His will, as well as the love of the beautiful Paula (Debra Winger) and
the
guidance of Foley, makes him stay the course and lifts him 'up where he
belongs'.Richard Gere is great in adding layers to what could have been a poorly
drawn characterisation. Mayo is not always the 'good guy' and is more
often
than not a complete prick. Nevertheless, he undertakes a journey of
self-discovery where he refuses to become a carbon copy of his father and
takes hold of his own destiny, turning himself into the man he wants to
be.
Gere has never been better on film than when he screams, `I got nowhere
else
to go!' at Foley in such a heartbreaking howl that the audience can
literally feel his pain.Debra Winger is also good as Paula, a downtrodden factory girl trapped in
a
small-minded small town with a lack of opportunities for women. She not
only
finds a way out in her love for Mayo, but the hope of a better future
somewhere else. Louis Gossett Jr. also stands out as the foul-mouthed,
domineering Sergeant Foley who proves to be pivotal in Mayo's
journey.With a great soundtrack, strong performances and the most rousing and
emotional final scene in a film since 'Rocky', 'An Officer And A
Gentleman'
deserves its place among the classics of film history.",124,1982
984,9.25,0.0,"The Beatles travel down from Liverpool to record a TV show.If I was to meet Richard Lester I would shake his hand and thank him
for recording the Beatles during the middle part of their career when
they could entertain but hadn't yet shot off in to outer space. Without
this we would have a piece missing from their history - and lets be
frank - our history. They changed the world and all they had to change
it with were electric guitars and their personalities!The script is clever in that it showcases the personalities of the
group without asking them to do much acting. Wilfred Brambell tags
along to give comedy relief and the whole thing fits in plenty of songs
that are good - but not as good as what soon followed. They are still
tied to the Northern dance halls.I have always thought that if they had a died in a car crash at this
point they would be a mystery to the modern audience - hugely popular
at the time - but not particularly stand-out from the other bands
around. Like the way we regard Charlie Chaplin or Mary Pickford - both
incredibly famous in their prime - but little regarded today. Whether you like to admit it or not there are three geniuses at work
and Ringo Starr. So I guess that it is fitting that Ringo comes across
the best of the group: Down-to-earth, chatty, witty and willing to talk
to anyone. Even the kids down by the river. John Lennon had a comic wit
that could have given him another career had his music not been up to
scratch. Talk about being master of the witty comeback. Anyone watching this film will see London as it really was at the time.
Not the swinging sixties that everyone pretends it was. Grubby shops,
unpainted windows that look about to fall out of their frames, empty
streets bar a few beat up cars. I guess you could say this is the perfect record of Beatlemania: The
driving beat songs (cranked out even quicker on stage), the backstage
sieges, the ping-pong put downs that is the hallmark of English humour,
the screaming that overpowered the performance. Enjoyable at the time

average Troma film, which is probably who should have released it in

986,12.2,7.8,"Just saw ""The Fallen Idol"" at the Nu-Art in West Los Angeles on the
last day of its one week run, with a new crystal clear 35 mm print. The
meaning of the title only becomes clear at the film's conclusion, so I
won't say much more on that score. From a Graham Greene novella which I
have never read, the author drafted the screenplay, so presumably the
film remains faithful to Greene's perennial themes: loyalty and
betrayal; faith and faithlessness; marriage and divorce. What makes
these issues intriguing is that the film largely revolves around the
point of view of an innocent, charming young boy called Phillipe,
played to perfection by Bobby Henrey. He lives in the London embassy of
a French speaking country, which is a sort of purgatory (always the
Catholic themes with Greene) which is both in England and not subject
to its laws. He is taken care of by a kind valet/ chef de maison called
Baines (understatedly played by Ralph Richardson) and his Cruella De
Ville of a wife (played as the personification of small-minded evil by
Sonia Dresdel). Phillipe has no mother (she has been unwell and away
for a long time), and no memory of her. Insteads, he has the run of his
own Garden of Eden-the huge Embassy with its lovely views over London,
great rooms and sweeping staircases. He even has his own snake- a pet
that he hides behind a brick on the balcony and carries around in his
pocket. He hero-worships Baines, who indulges him and talk to him and
hates Mrs Baines who orders him around, hectors him and threatens him
at every turn. The story of the film occurs over a week-end, where
Phillippe and the Baines' are left alone in the Embassy as the
ambassador has gone to bring back his wife from her convalescence, and
revolves how Phillipe understands the love triangle between Mr Baines
and Mrs Baines and the lovely Julie (played with cheek-bones high) by
Michele Morgan, speaking both French and English.Look out for some terrific performances by the main cast (especially
Bobby Henrey as Phillipe), but also by a series of supporting
characters : two washerwomen, a sharp tongued lady of the night, a
kindly bobby, several detectives and a perceptive doctor. The
photography bears mentioning. There are shades of the ""Third Man"", as
well as a great hide and seek game in darkness under the furniture in
the empty Embassy, and a truly memorable run through the empty streets
of London in the dark. From a personal point of view I enjoyed several
scenes shot on location at the London Zoo, which was all very familiar
even from a fifty year vantage point.The film won a British Academy award so it's not exactly undiscovered,
but it's not been easy to find at revival theaters or on DVD, but it
deserves to be. As I said at the top, a minor masterpiece which
operates on many levels. (Los Angeles-April 2006).",95,1948

history. Burt Lancaster gives one of the great performances of all time and
really should have won the Oscar. Susan Sarandon is also superb, and their
scenes together are unforgettable. Kate Reid as a faded gangster's moll is

apartment certain that her coveted best friend is dead. After officers
come to question her, she discovers that Carole has barely survived the
incident but is critically injured and disfigured.Alyce is quickly consumed by overwhelming guilt, and begins
experiencing ghostly hallucinations about her friend. She turns to the
very substances that led to the accident for ""comfort"", and one drug is
rapidly replaced by even stronger drugs. With a sociopathic drug dealer
administering his special brand of social philosophy as her only

tale. But just as the primary character transforms, so does the whole
story. It is difficult to categorize the film because the genre is
constantly evolving the shifting. This film is not what is presents itself to be initially, and neither
is the lead character. What emerges is a gruesome, cold-blooded killing
spree and complete madness. Three characters who are likely targets for
the killing spree are spared, while others are indiscriminately
slaughtered. I'm not sure of the reasoning. One character is hacked to
bits and ground into mush, but I see the reasoning behind the action.The main casts acting was convincing enough to earn credibility,
thought was put into characters and their development. Buckle up and

interest in. To see what i mean, watch the Tim Burton Alice movie again
and watch what all new characters do within the first two minutes of

990,8.2,7.6,"Let's call this film a documentary. Sure, these were actors following a
script. But more importantly, it documents a segment of life that few
readers in the developed world have any insight into.For those who avoid graphic violence, I suggest reading the section on
this site that describes specifically what it is, and shut your eyes
selectively. I did; but still couldn't relax enough to have dinner
afterward until I downed several shots of Scotch. I was shaken, my
throat constricted, and imbued with a feeling that may be a mild dose
of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.But documentaries are like that. And when I read that the
writer-director, Cary Joji Fukunaga, had actually lived with his
subjects, and risked his life voluntarily, as they do out of routine
necessity, I consider the least I can do is vicariously experience this
reality. It is a reality that I see every day in the frightened eyes of
those stunted young men congregating around ""Home Depot"" looking for a
day's wages.It reflects a life so mean, so violent, that the lawless Tijuana is a
Nirvana compared to their home slums of Honduras and Guatemala. So
first they come to Mexico, then ride the trains to the ultimate goal,
America. In doing so they run a gauntlet of dangers that could only be
conveyed in a dramatization such as this.Empathy, compassion to all in our society, is a luxury for those born
into a world where such emotion is the norm. Even in America's
imperfect society, the rule of law predominates and the random violence
is still newsworthy. The people in this film, especially the gang
members had no such choice. These gangs provide a circle of affection
and caring, but it is defined by the contrast between those who are
their ""homies"" and the outsiders, the other gangs, for whom cruelty has
no limits.On a day trip last week to Baja California, we were stopped at a check
point configured exactly like the one in the film. A single soldier in
bullet proof vest surrounded by sand bags with a 50 caliber machine gun
pointed at our car. My friend struck up a conversation with the guard;
they both smiled, and we went on our way, to stop at a bakery right
before crossing the border and heading to our home in Encinitas.Similar check points; but for those refugees in ""Sin Nombres"" huddled
in the empty car on the truck, their lives depended on not being seen.
If they had been spotted, and then run out of fear, the machine gun
would have killed them in a second, by soldiers hardened by the same
violence they face.My day trip to Mexico, while covering same type of territory, could not
have been more different. I had my American Express Card and an
American Passport, along with a cloak of protection by the norms of an
ordered society. Those depicted in the film had none of this. Their
lives were determined at the moment of their birth, with choices so
limited that their desperate Odyssey to reach what was my birthright
was their best available option .This is an important film. Perhaps it should be edited with the more
horrible graphic acts simply alluded to, to make it more accessible to
a wider audience in America. While it provides no political
prescription, it conveys an accurate picture of the reality of life
just below our border.If there is to be a political plan to addressing our ""illegal
immigrant"" problem, at the least it should be informed by the road
taken by those depicted in this powerful film.",96,2009

entertaining in a way I can hardly describe. First: The Title. A movie
titled ""Ninja Cheerleaders"" is just a ""gotto see this movie"" to me.
Anyway - the story is incredibly stupid (cheerleader strippers fight to
get back the strip club of their ninja master against Michael pare -
and to top it, they have to win a strip contest to get money for
college....ha ha ha ha). This is a great setting for a really funny but
stupid film, but the camera work, the directing work, the music, the
actors - everything is just so bad. It is so badly made, it is
sometimes hard to watch. But the girls are cute, they are brutal, they
beat up everything they can - and then their is Captain Sulu as the
master and Michael Pare. I want to like this film - if it was better

a film for men, who wanna see babes beat up guys.",81,2008
993,12.5,6.4,"This movie really is an underrated gem. Somehow most critics have
become totally unable to accept Woody Allen's work for what it is and
compare it only to other movies from the same years.Woody Allen has said many times that he has no interest in looking back
to his old work and, in my opinion, it really shows. From someone who
has often raved about the 'Radio Days' of his youth and adores prewar
Jazz, he has steadily developed into a director who has no trouble
catching the modern every day lives of the people around him.
Recreating the atmosphere from his older movies would only show the
inability to move on, along with the rest of the world.Anything Else is proof of that. It's a modern movie with a typical
Woody Allen style dialogue that works on several levels. Between the
jokes and witty remarks and often great replies, lie the worries of any
young guy or girl that has to learn to deal with life's fears and
frustrations. Anything Else also has a really nice atmosphere and a
great pace - the movie at almost 2 hours never feels like it's stalling
or going nowhere. The story moves forward constantly. Biggs really is
the star here and is a perfect Young Woody Allen. Ricci is only a
supporting character, but both she and the rest of the cast really make
this into a believable, relaxed and enjoyable experience.For those who are willing to learn a little: this movie does make a
simple, but very true point about learning to deal with life.Photography, directing, editing and writing is really first class work
- nothing less than what you get in other top Woody Allen movies.
Beautiful locations, great camera work and typical Woody style jazz
really make this into a perfect 10/10.The lack of awards and negative reviews are just like Dobel (Woody
Allen) says in this movie: You know....it's just like anything else.Go see it for yourselves!",108,2003

at work.It's too bad the film didn't include scenes showing the president being
briefed on the attack and then going to bed in order to get some rest
before his fund-raiser in Las Vegas. It would have been powerful to
contrast what was happening in Benghazi and the presidents actions
while the attack was still taking place. What's truly sad is how these people were abandoned by the politicians.

agree. I'd stress that I'm a huge Charlie Kaufman fan and my
anticipation on going to see the film was equally as big as my
disappointment after I'd done so. So what's the problem? I think it's
the smallness of the story;yes it's about alienation,yes it's clever,
yes the sex scene is achingly real and uncomfortable, but this movie
has only a few points to make  mostly about alienation and the
""otherness"" of people  and while it makes them well, they don't amount
to a decent movie. Thinking about it afterwards  and puzzled by the
praise it has received and disconcerted by my own disappointment  I
realised that if this movie has been made with human actors it simply
wouldn't get the same sort of critical acclaim, in fact, it would be
deemed dull, dull, dull. The thing which lifts it out of the ordinary 
but not into the extraordinary  is the fact that it's told via
animation. I urge anyone who loves the movie to try and imagine sitting
through the same script acted by real people  it would be achingly

I was captivated by the lovely erotic scenes. Although there is a love
story in it, the film isn't entirely an happily ever after affair.

1000,12.5,5.1,"You couldn't make it up. Except they did: it took two guys to write the
story of Frank Ryan, a tough mercenary (played by the inimitable Brian
Thompson) who's hired to rescue a foreign rebel leader, and does so by
teaming up with a bevy of hot female agents and posing as a gay fashion
photographer on a location shoot. Thompson even gets to kiss Oliver
Reed and then shoot all his bodyguards.Every line is a classic. Random quote: ""Murder, blood, and paranoia are
going to make fine company where you're going."" The direction is equal
to the words. Nico Mastorakis (aided by Peter Rader) is a trash auteur
of Albert Pyun proportions and aside from some okay Steadicam shots the
movie is as flat as painted brickwork.Reed plays the bad guy, Bartos, with an outrageous Johnny Foreigner
accent and that walrus moustache of his. He's keeping the rebel leader
captive and somehow can't see through the good guys' ruse. Too busy
molesting his female staff, perhaps. Meanwhile, Frank's boss is played
by George Kennedy, who you'll remember foaming at the mouth in The
Naked Gun.The editing is in a league of its own awfulness. There's a scene early
on when Frank is creeping into Bartos's office, and we keep cutting
back to the party downstairs for half a second at a time. It's not
tense, it's just jarring. And in the final shootout it's virtually
impossible to tell who's shooting who.All of this should add up to a dismal movie, but there's too much fun
and conviction and energy for it to be wholly dismissed. Kind of like
Plan 9 in that regard. And there's a legitimately great scene where
Frank is reporting back to the boss on a bugged line, so he's having to
convey his progress via fashion metaphors - ""Cosmo are 'dying' to
meet!"" Unfortunately there's not enough action, and precious little
peril, to achieve the Commando gold standard of 80s action movie
rewatchability. (Well, it just snuck into 1990.) What there's plenty of
is camp, including numerous big-haired fashion shoot/military training
montages and more than one raucous female prison. Plus henchmen so
stupid they make video game A.I. of the time look smart. Oh yes, and
the worst sex scene in film history, complete with actual pan pipes.Put this one on your 'So Bad It's Good' shelf. It's objectively
terrible but somehow irresistible.",91,1990
1001,4.5,6.6,"""Louder Than Bombs"" (2015 release from Norway/France; 109 min.) brings
the story of the Reed family. As the movie opens, we see Jonah Red
(played by Jesse Eisenberg) in the hospital with his wife and their
newborn baby. After the movie's opening credits, we then shift to
Isabelle Reed (played by Isabelle Huppert), a NYT was photographer who
perished a few years ago and is now the subject of a retrospective. The
NYT reporter who worked with her is going to write a long piece on it,
and gives a heads up to widower Gene Reed (played by Gabriel Byrne).
Finally, we also get to know Conrad Reed, the younger brother of Jonah.
Conrad is struggling in high school, and also at home. At this point
we're about 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot
would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for
yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Norwegian
writer-director Joachim Trier, whose previous movie, 2011's ""Oslo,
August 31st"" was outstanding. This is his first English language movie,
and here Trier dives into a complex family drama. It took me a while to
figure out who was who, and what exactly is going on. Perhaps the
emotional linchpin of the movie is young Conrad (played by
newcomer--for me anyway Devin Druid), who's sulking character at first
is not very likable, but as more and more peels of the onion are
removed, the Conrad character is developed deeper and fuller. When
older brother Jonah urges Conrad to ""sit out"" the high school years,
Conrad nods but of course does the exact opposite... The movie
structure for ""Louder Than Bombs"" is further complicated because of the
multiple flashbacks involving Isabelle. And how exactly did she die
anyway? This movie reminded me at times of the Robert Redford-directed
family drama ""Ordinary People"" from 1980. In other words: heavy duty
stuff. I don't know whether Eisenberg has played a better role in his
still relatively young career. He is vulnerable as the older brother
and the husband, trying to deal with a lot of things coming at him in
life. Also keep your eyes out for a fairly small role from
up-and-coming Rachel Brosnahan as Jonah's ex-girlfriend Erin. People
sometimes make good choices, sometimes bad choices, ""but you can't plan
for what happens after you've made a choice"", cautions the NYT
journalist at one point. There is a lot of good music in the film, both
as to the original score composed by Ola Fløttum (unknown to me), and
as to other incidental music (including Tangerine Dream's ""Love On a
Real Train"" in a newly re-recorded and extended version).The theater's Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at this past
weekend turned out to be a private screening, as in: I literally was
the only person in the theater. That is a darn shame. I recognize that
this type of film isn't going to attract big crowds, but not even a
small crowd? Jeez... Maybe this movie will find a larger audience on
VOD or when it is eventually released on DVD/Blu-ray. Regardless, if
you are in the movie for a heavy duty family drama that features some
great performances, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Louder Than Bombs""
is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",109,2015
1002,9.666666666666666,5.2,"Notorious Italian smutmeister supreme Tinto Brass delivers six ribald
tales about various youthful couples and their carnal escapades. First
outing, ""Alibi"" - A man convinces his wife (luscious blonde Sarah
Cosmi) to make love to a hunky bellhop. Second yarn, ""Double Trouble"" -
Two couples get in on with the each other's spouses. Third vignette,
""Two Hearts & a Hut"" - A maid (buxom knockout Raffaella Ponzo) works
for a kinky rich German lady (broadly played by Virginia Barrett).
Fourth segment, ""Jolly Bangs"" - A bickering couple discuss their
infidelities while lounging on the beach. Fifth story, ""Evil To Him Who
Thinks Evil"" - A frustrated photographer can't get his model fiancé
(tasty brunette Maruska Albertazzi) to engage in anal intercourse with
him. Sixth, best, and funniest short, ""Call Me Pig I Like It"" - An
amorous young couple enjoy their honeymoon in London, England. This is
perhaps the most amusing and wittiest of the six stories, with a great
cameo by Brass himself at the very end as a peeping tom. Brass relates
every last segment at a quick pace, maintains a breezy'n'bubbly tone
throughout, gleefully mines a brash and unapologetic line in raunchy
humor, and, of course, depicts the raw sexuality on display in a most
graphic and unflinching manner (besides the expected explicit
lovemaking, we also get such racy stuff as S&M, voyeurism, and
lesbianism to keep things lusty and arousing from start to finish).
Naturally, there's a wondrous array of insanely smokin' hot women who
show off their sizzling sensuous stuff with a terrific lack of shame
and inhibition, plus even the guys bare their wares as well. Frederico

easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive
aspects of Little Man. First, I'm impressed with the special effects.
It really did look like Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of
a little person. I never doubted it for a minute.Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier
played an annoying restaurant singer, and his renditions of ""Havin' My
Baby"" and ""Movin' On Up"" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who,
coincidentally, played Grier's father in 1992's Boomerang (if you
remember, he ""coordinated"" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket)
now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun.Beyond that, this movie is about as believable as White Chicks. How
dumb is it when even the doctor can't tell that it's a 40-year-old man
and not a baby? He's got a full set of teeth!!! How is it possible that
no one seems to notice that it's not a baby? Little Man is so bad that
there's a Rob Schneider cameo. And please, if you're stupid enough to
waste $8 on this movie, at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your
children. This movie is way too sexual for small children (lots of
jokes and innuendo about sex, going down, eating out, etc.), and I felt
embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening I
was forced to endure. If you insist on seeing an idiotic film, as least
spare your children the pain and suffering.",0,2006

back with his most perfectly realised film. While hardly unapplauded on
its
release (and in short retrospect) this is a movie that will be regarded by
future generations as a classic. It is so smart, sassy, funny and has a
beginning, a middle and an end. The kind of tragicomedy that gets the best

occasionally. We don't like him much - nor should we - but he is not so
bad

(available in two parts on YouTube under the title ""Talk by Michael C.
Ruppert"") the picture he paints for the future of the world has been a
stark one for some time now.However, gloomy is one thing. Being deadly accurate in nearly all
predictions is another thing altogether. Ruppert, and his team at From
the Wilderness (his newsletter) have been bang on the money when it
came to oil prices, housing prices, and of course the collapse of the
US housing market, and in other areas as well including drugs, the CIA
and 9/11 itself. Ruppert being an ex LAPD narcotics officer who was
born into an intelligence family, has had experience in seeing truth
where others bury their heads in the sand. When he tried to bring to
light evidence that the CIA was dealing drugs within the USA, he was
shot at and forced off of LAPD. This was only the beginning of his
investigative career, and of the vicious repercussions he suffered
because of it. In November of 2004, his book ""Crossing the Rubicon: The
Decline of the American Empire and the End of the Age of Oil"" went
largely unnoticed, even though it could serve as a final nail in Dick
Cheney's political coffin concerning his culpability for 9/11. Ruppert
has said, ""This is a book that I, as a detective, would... drop in the
lap of a DA and say, 'I want a filing for murder, premeditated, first
degree, multiple counts with special circumstances."" The best part: he
makes no mention of bombs in buildings, or holes in the pentagon, or
molten metal, but merely treats the case as another crime to be pieced
together and solved. His conclusions are staggering.And in light of this, to hear what he predicts is yet to come is
guaranteed send a chill down your spine, even if you don't believe him.
And what does he predict? Nothing short of the collapse of
industrialized civilization itself. How could this ever happen? Quite
simply, the world runs out of oil. Since everything we do is dependent
upon oil... well it's probably best if I let Ruppert speak for himself.The film plays like one of Ruppert's more impassioned talks, albeit
with some cinematography added in to keep the eye amused. We are in an
undefined space that looks like a bunker, or an interrogation room.
Ruppert sits in a chair, smoking cigarettes (presumably to calm his
nerves, or as he's been known to say ""I smoke as many cigarettes as I
want to, but not nearly as many as the movie would have you believe"")
and tells us what's on his mind. And by the time you're done seeing
""Collapse"" it'll be on your mind too... no matter how hard you try not
to believe it. What makes ""Collapse"" so much more powerful than the angry rants and
shenanigans of Michael Moore is that while Moore may be passionate
about what he's talking about, it's clear that Ruppert is more than
passionate... he's scared to death. What's worse, and also unlike Moore
who has received greater publicity than many fiction filmmakers,
Ruppert has suffered from a kind of Cassandra syndrome for sometime.
His writings and speeches are prophetic and yet, until recently, he has
gone mostly unnoticed by the majority of people. Despite this, he's
cracked open some of the biggest cases of all time: the CIA dealing
drugs, empirical evidence that Dick Cheney was directly responsible for
thousands of deaths on 9/11, and most recently, the collapse of the
global housing market. It's not difficult to picture a similar but more
ancient voice shouting ""Don't let the horse through the gates of Troy!
It will bring ruin!"" only to be met with violence and humiliation.As is true with so many visionaries, Mike Ruppert is just now beginning
to be heard... and like so many useful visions, the realization is
coming too late.",82,2009
1018,10.5,8.0,"Fritz Lang, a man who knew the business like no other, is seen at the
top of his craft with this interesting film noir that pays off in
unexpected ways. Mr. Lang was a man that believed in total control and
who wanted to get the best out of everyone in all his films. ""The Big
Heat"" is one of those rare films in which all the elements come
together with surprising results.Corruption in higher places is the basis of the story. A good police
detective who cares enough to keep on probing into the suicide of one
of his comrades, is what brings Dave Bannion, not only to the attention
of the higher ups in the police department, but to Lagano and the
mobsters that work for this evil man. Tragedy finds a way into Dave's
home that makes him even more resolved into seeking justice and
unmasking the mobsters found along the way that have a grip on the
police department.The casting of ""The High Heat"" is what makes this film different from
the rest of the films of the genre. Glenn Ford made an excellent
appearance in the film. He gives one of the best performances of his
career. But of course, the film belongs to Gloria Grahame, the bad girl
in most of the films of this genre. What a joy it's to watch her! Her
Debby Marsh is one of the best roles she portrayed for the movies.
Surprisingly, Ms. Grahame and Mr. Ford show a lot of chemistry in their
scenes together.The others in the film do good work under Mr. Lang's direction. A young
Lee Marvin is perfectly creepy as Vince Stone, a man who gets what's
coming to him at the end in a memorable sequence playing against Ms.
Grahame. Jeannette Nolan makes a valuable contribution as the bad widow
of the man that commits suicide. Alexander Scourby, as Lagana has some
good moments. Joselyn Brando plays Dave's wife. Also, in a small part
we see Carolyn Jones.""The Big Heat"" demonstrates why Fritz Lang was one of the best
influences in the American cinema.",90,1953
1019,8.6,7.8,"Sidney Lumet proved himself to be a highly competent and effective
director/storyteller for the true story of New York Officer Frank
Serpico, who became famous after appearing to testify before the NAPA
Commission about payoffs and corruption in the Police Department. At
the time, it was unheard of, and it gained Peter Maars attention to
write the book, which thus got transferred to the screen as so. But
what makes Serpico such a riveting and eye catching picture today are
the little things about it, little details in specific scenes and
locations that help ring Serpico's emotions far more than true- it's
just there. Even more amazing on the part of the actual filming of the
movie is that it was at the time filmed backwards (started with the
beard, then the mustache, then clean-shaven).Al Pacino, right off of the first part of the Godfather trilogy, took
this role with all the fire and compassion that he had in him. He sees
in Serpico not just an honest cop wanting some balance and honor in his
work, yet also a man, who can get as joyful and humorous as he can act
subtle, furious, and thoughtful. This will always remain one of his
stand-out roles after all the Scarfaces and Scent of a Woman pictures
he can do because he, as well as Lumet, know how to approach such a
saga. Plenty of great, compelling set pieces, and even sweet ones (like
when he first buys the sheepdog as a puppy). A+",130,1973

accompany the opening credits, which consisted for mostly CCTV /
voyeuristic shots of a team conducting surveillance on the movements of
Harrison Ford's Jack Stanfield and his family. I know it's a cool
track, but Angel is perhaps becoming one of the more overused tracks in
Hollywood pictures already.But it hints well at what Firewall is going to become. Cliché and
overused sequences which will probably make you scream ""haven't I seen
this somewhere before""? Firewall offered nothing very new in terms of
plot outline, as it contains modified scenes from even Ford's own works
like Air Force One (the family's survival being threatened, and it's up
to one man to save the day) and The Fugitive (the frame up and one
man's run from the law). Ford has already become comfortable in the
role of an all-American one man hero, that this role offered no
surprises at all.It's basically standard fare with the usual chases and action fight
sequences. Stansfield is a VP of (network) security of a bank, and has
designed the bank's software, with other operational duties like making
sure the bank can respond to external online threats. However, as the
saying goes, almost 80% of intrusion are committed knowingly or
unknowingly from the inside, and with a head honcho part of the act,
you can be sure that he has the know-how to siphon out cash if he wants
to.In comes Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), scheming con man, who with his team
of merry men, take Stanfield's family hostage and lapses into the usual
psycho-mumbo-jumbo routine. With the family's antics at escaping, you
really wonder if Cox, as a villain, has what it takes to call the shots
in a hostage situation. While he might have the upper hand, it's his
weakness in being ruthless to the hostages that proved his downfall,
and make him a very weak cinematic villain. Here's someone who would
rather shoot at his own men than to teach them hostages a lesson.
Probably he has this noble subscription to ""women and children first"".
And it doesn't help when there's the usual good guy amongst his merry
men who offers the family sympathy points.Word of caution though, for those who might think that this film offers
some cool technology on screen. Leave the techno-babble at the door,
there's no ""firewall"" to hack into in the first place, and the
""hacking"" is actually a no-brainer. And unless the USA offers wireless
internet access like everywhere, it's pretty incredible with what a
laptop can do in the movie.It has your expected twists and seemingly smart moments, but nothing
that will truly make you go ""wow"". The fist fight choreography can get
pretty intense, however, there's no need to reach the end of the road
before you know who's gonna emerge tops. It isn't exactly a bad movie,
but one which doesn't even have a single sequence that can redeem this
picture from really bad mediocrity.",0,2006

espionage thriller which intersects events from post-Stalinist Russia

woman trapped between two men. Enchanting faces and majestic landscapes
with falling snow and an expressive score  all of this creates a
passionate and mysterious atmosphere. The film is full of tension,
drama and emotion.Some critics objected to the supposedly unrealistic costumes and
details of the lifestyle of Russians. However, I can not agree with
that. The style of life of Russian people has always been dependent on
the social status of people, even at that time and the elite which was
depicted in the film certainly were not ordinary folk. To the
director's credit, she has avoided the thoroughly traded road of
vulgarization of the Russian people on the silver screen.The actors have created characters which are true to life and difficult
to forget. There are no doubts that the film will become one of the
classics of its genre.Sarif has definitively made a great casting, the role of older Misha

basically The Terminator with a storm thrown in for good measure. The
US has created an artificial intelligence called Echelon which becomes
self-aware and turns on its creators. Our only hope is in a clinically
inept woman and her robot buddy who are following a series of cryptic
clues to stopping Echelon left to her in a VHS tape by her dead father,
one of the creators of Echelon. Our bungling heroes are doggedly
pursued by evil Echelon robots and psychotic government agents, neither
of which are fully explained due to formulaic, lacklustre writing. The
murder of the girl's father, Echelon's ability to manipulate the
weather, the sudden appearance of the VHS tape at just the right moment
and the father's use of cryptic clues to lead his daughter to the 'kill
switch' instead of just telling her straight up on the tape could also
have used some explanation.Despite a relatively promising story, the film is let down by a
terrible cast of Z-list TV actors and a director with a background in
mannequin restoration. Sometimes it's possible to salvage a bad film
with good editing, but the editor here had very little to work with and
with this being his first film was completely out of his depth. The CGI is also terrible. I've come to expect bad CGI in low budget
films from 10 years ago, but this film is less than two years old. It
seems anyone with even a little experience in Cinema 4D and After
Effects thinks they can start their own visual effects company and make
feature length films. If only it was as easy as that.This is a prime example of a low budget film where no-one in the
production was prepared to give 100% or even lift a finger if they
weren't paid extra for it. Everything about this film is cheap and
formulaic. If you've seen one SyFy film, you've seen them all and

a bit off putting. I mean, the movie actually has a Chekhov's gun, only
his name is not Chekhov and he's black! The military tactics used are
bad, but not laughable. Also the ending... I am conflicted about it. On
one hand it could be Matrix's AI in the human world sequel that we've
dreamed about ever since Smith uploaded himself into a person. On the
other hand it could be a high tech classic villain second wind which
dooms the story to obscurity.Bottom line: There are no high level questions being asked about

of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his
dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is
out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him.
It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action
movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John
Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts,
kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick
succeeds in its simplicity.As an action movie buff, all I wanted to see in this movie is some
inventive action sequences, and I was not disappointed. Every single
action sequence in this movie is fast-paced, beautifully shot, fluid,
intense, and you never have trouble understanding what's going on. The
direction of this film is fantastic, as is the writing. There's no
melodramatic soapy story lines - everything is straight and to the
point, and the point is to get to the action. Not one moment in this
movie is boring. The short dialogue is effective from getting to action
sequence A to sequence B without any confusion as to any character's
motive. It's all laid out in front of you - all you have to do is sit
back and enjoy the insanity happening on screen.Remember when Live Free or Die Hard came out and people were upset that
John McClane only fired pistols throughout the entire movie? I like a
little versatility when it comes to action heroes, and evidently so do
the writers. John Wick wrecks face with pistols, assault rifles,
shotguns, knives, even mano-a-mano; the man can do anything. The
difference between John Wick and other modern action movies (Die Hard 5
and Taken 3 for instance) is that you actually believe John Wick is
killable. He's not some invincible superhero like Bruce Willis was in
Die Hard 5, having his car crash and flip like a hundred times and the
second it stops he gets out without a scratch and starts running. No,
John Wick takes a beating in this film. Numerous times in fact. But
most of the time he's kicking ass and taking names, and instead of
acting as some unstoppable killing machine, he just seems like a guy
who's an expert in his field. He used to be a hit-man after all.John Wick is a blast to watch. Really, it's just a mindlessly fun
action movie. It has large-scale shootouts, CQC sequences, and a
classic hero-villain hand-to-hand confrontation at the end. The only
negative I can say about the movie is that the villains aren't anything
to write home about. They're Russian mobsters which we've seen a
million times, and their leader isn't given enough to work with as far
as character goes. Willam DaFoe has a brief but important role though
as Wick's former colleague. Regardless, John Wick is all about the action and it goes above and
beyond in every respect. It's a breath of fresh air after all the poor
sequels we've been getting, and thankfully John Wick has the potential
to be the next great action franchise. An absolute must-watch for
action fans.",101,2014

brothers hold them hostage, as they await the return of Mother.I've only ever seen clips of the original, but from what I can tell
that this is almost completely different, such as the setting instead
of in the backwoods America we get a suburban house-hold in which I was
slightly disappointed, being a huge fan of backwoods survival flicks,
but accepted and understood the necessity for the change. The backdrop
definitely made it a more realistic take on the story, which seemed to
be what the filmmakers were going for. With all the changes, the movie
is now more of a home invasion crime thriller than the horror flick
that many might've thought it'd be.The performances in this movie are top notch especially Rebecca De
Mornay who plays the sadistic mother showing the audience a kind (yet
still devious) and sadistic side of her character and the great lengths
that she'd go to protect her family, and it's also nice to see her back

to tag along. This makes for a great story. Chucky really shows his
true colors and sick, twisted sense of humor here. We also have an
interesting group of characters here, who are actually worth

because Andy's not a kid? New setting? No matter what the reason, this

""Child's Play 2"" deserves a place very close to the top.This sequel picks up two years after the original in which young Andy
Barclay (Alex Vincent) was tormented by Chucky, the killer-possessed
doll trying to transfer his soul into the child's body. With his mother
traumatized, Andy is sent to live with a foster family. Trouble is,
there's a certain rebuilt Good Guy brand doll all too eager to get
reacquainted.""Child's Play 2"" is solid horror fare. It has legitimate thrills as the
seemingly innocent doll plunges to murderous life in the blink of an

however, is an exciting finale at the Good Guy doll factory in which
Chucky, piece by piece, meets his maker. First he's forced to amputate
his own hand (he replaces it with a knife blade). Then his legs are
torn off in an unsuccessful maiming. Next he's showered in gallons of
steaming hot doll plastic before finally having an electrical cord
stuffed in his mouth, exploding his head into a thousand gooey pieces.
Where do they come up with this stuff?There are plenty of other things to like about this picture. Its budget
is much higher than that of the original, a fact that shows up in leaps
and bounds on the screen. With the origin storyline out of the way, the
sequel is able to focus solely on the excitement without getting bogged
down in too many details. And Brad Dourif outdoes himself as the
creepily frightening voice of the homicidal doll.""Child's Play 2"" established Chucky as a legitimate horror icon. Simply

the foul mouthed psycho doll complete with body modifications and a
punky bride in a movie filled with funny one liners and black humor.
However, when Chucky came to life almost 20 years ago, he was a real
thrill that redefined the horror genre of the late 80s and spawned a
series of imitators (some better than others).Director Tom Holland crafts this very original tale written by Don
Mancini, where a dying sociopath (Brad Douriff) uses voodoo to
transplant his soul to an inanimate toy. Catherine Hicks plays Karen
Barclay, a single mother who gets the possessed toy for her little son
Andy (Alex Vincent), not knowing what is hidden deep inside the doll.Despite its apparent cheesiness, Holland truly creates a haunting
atmosphere filled with suspense by following the trick Steven Spielberg
used in ""Jaws"". While we know from the very beginning that the toy is
haunted, we never get a glimpse of what he can do and neither does the
characters; only the young Andy knows the truth, but nobody believes
him.Unlike its current MTV-inspired incarnations, ""Child's Play"" starts a
bit slow, but suddenly it turns into a suspense-filled roller-coaster
with enough thrills to keep you at the edge of the seat. Holland
directions truly makes the difference between a cheap B-movie and the
classy film this one has become.Brad Dourif makes a superb job and this movie started his now-legendary
career in the genre. Catherine Hicks is a very good lead character,
surprisingly realistic, thanks in part to the very well-written dialog.
Chris Sarandon completes the cast as the detective investigating the
mysterious murders surrounding Chucky and Andy.The movie moves at a very good pace, despite its slow start; it has
that 80s feeling and it is surprisingly violent for its time (it was
released when rules were turning a bit stricter). It has great special
effects and a very creepy atmosphere inside it's urban landscape.While many reviewers consider a flaw the fact that Chucky's possession
is not a mystery, I believe that a lot of the suspense is in the fact
that we know that, but the characters don't. It is a very well
constructed film in the end, and definitely better than its current
sequels. 8/10",87,1988
1041,4.5,5.2,"This movie was a surprising little film for its intelligence and a nice
change of pace for a repetitive genre. In films that open the same way
this film does- two people of different social classes meet at a bar,
one seems like a simple man of good repute and the conformist ideals of
a hero, the other a dark, sexy foreign woman of the upper class who
appears to be the femme fatal (the one who will drag this upright
citizen through the depths of hell in a web of dangerous passion)- you
think you've seen it all before. But the story turns in on itself- it
is the hero of this film who carries a dark past, a not so clean cut
belief system, and a desire to rebel against society- he is the violent
one in turmoil going through his own form of hell. It is the female
foreigner and seducer (played fantastically by Paz Vega) who raises him
out of the depths to which he has sunk by instilling in him the need to
connect with others and the ability to confront his past. Their affair
is dangerous but necessary for character growth. He brings her down,
but she saves him from himself. The ending scene is brilliant- the man
paints his (metaphorical and literal) blue room to ""White"". He needs
Michael (Paz Vega's character) to help him reach a state of solace to
paint his life and create an empty canvas upon which the audience can
draw their own conclusions. Is their affair healthy? No...maybe? Is it
necessary, their coming into each others lives, and destroying what
they have each built for themselves? YES",103,2008

though, Michael Gambon and Albert Finney, were shameless scene
stealers, but one can hardly fault them for their excellence. There
were many things to like about this film. It was gorgeous to look at,
brilliantly capturing the look and sound of a sumptuous age. The pacing
and editing were fine, though the device using flashbacks for most of
the film occasionally led to a moments confusion about when a scene was
supposed to be taking place. And the story itself is quite
inspirational. A note for my Canadian readers and the Canadians who
attended the TIFF screenings. The film mostly covered the struggle to
outlaw slavery in Britain itself, though they did touch on
Wilberforce's efforts to have it outlawed throughout the British
Empire. This continued in the years after the conclusion of the film,
and a Bill to do just that was passed in 1833, a month after
Wilberforce died. So the film we watched was very much about our own
history, and the story of the abolition of slavery in Britain directly
affected the eventual abolition of slavery in Canada.",118,2006

Sudeikis actually does a really good job in a non comedic role and is
almost the perfect choice for the coach. This is a movie I cannot say

shown in a high majority of scenes. On the other end, however, there

something it didn't promise and that took me by surprise. The
Stepfather, as I'm sure you all know, is a remake (reboot?) of the 80's
slasher series that set the tone for every darn Lifetime movie starring
Valerie Bertinelli or Nancy McKeon. A desperate divorcée falls for a
mysterious guy who, despite telegraphing to the audience how evil he
secretly is, manages to fool his fiancée and her family into thinking
that he's a swell guy....that is, until the body count starts. The plot
isn't worth discussing. There's nothing here that we haven't seen
before. What IS worth discussing is the director's obvious decision to
exploit Amber Heard's lovely figure in one long never ending cheesecake
sequence. You could make the argument that the ONLY reason this film
was even made in the first place was to launch Amber into the
stratosphere of blogworthy sex symbols (not unlike what Michael Bay
managed to do with Megan Fox). You'll see Amber in her underwear
lounging in bed, Amber in her itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini, gratuitous
close-ups of her splendid anatomy, etc. This exploitation becomes so
flagrant that it distracts from the story itself, which is probably a
good thing. In a way the Stepfather 2009 comes off more like a 70's
Drive-In flick; the kind teenagers would flock to in hopes of seeing a
little skin. Maybe that was the point after all? I sure hope it was.

1053,4.5,8.3,"THE definitive saga of backstage brouhaha ever dished out by Hollywood. A
triumph of screen-writing, never will one see such ripe, acrid dialogue
spewed out like this again -- every indelible scene gloriously stained
with
classic one-liners. An actress wanna-be looking for her big break
carefully
worms her way into the glamorous life of a legendary Broadway star, then
tries to supplant her privately and professionally.A sterling, incandescent cast provides the fire and music to this concerto
of theatre attitude. Bette Davis knew she was handed a dream role when
she
was cast as Margo Channing, the indomitable diva caught up in the throes
of
mid-life crisis both on- and off-stage. Not willing at all to deal with
it
tactfully, she makes life a living hell for anyone within knife-throwing
distance. This juicy, once-in-a-lifetime part turned Davis' own flagging
middle-aged career back on its feet, especially coming on the heels of one
of her biggest ""dumps"" ever, ""Beyond the Forest."" Remarkable as it may
seem, Bette was not the first choice here, replacing an injured Claudette
Colbert. With all due respect to Colbert, Bette Davis was BORN to play
Margo Channing. A mauling lioness one minute, a coy, declawed pussycat
the
next, Davis relishes every wickedly bitchy scene she gets to tear into.
Yet
in her more introspective moments, she evokes real sympathy for Margo (as
only a true star can) especially when her character missteps. It's a
resounding victory for the Queen Bee in every way, shape and
form.Her ""supporting cast"" also manage to create a buzz of excitement. Gary
Merrill and Hugh Marlowe, known for their relative blandness, are splendid
here in their respective roles as queen bee's lover and playwright. While
Merrill's Bill Sampson tames Margo the woman with gutsy directness and
virile passion, Marlowe's Lloyd Richards appeases Margo the star with
flattery, great dialogue and a calm resolve. Worth watching, then, are
their fireworks scenes with Margo when intelligence and restraint no
longer
work. Debonair George Sanders gives customary snob appeal and dry
cynicism
to his waspish, ultimately loathsome columnist Addison DeWitt, who swarms
around Broadway's elite knowledgeable in the fact his lack of heart and
poison pen yield exclusive rights and power. The most sensitive and
sensible one in the collective bunch, the one lacking a true stinger, is
Karen Richards (played wonderfully by Celeste Holm), Margo's best friend
and
confidante, who finds herself caught between the queen and a hard place
when
she accidentally makes a pact with the devil. Thelma Ritter couldn't be
overlooked if she tried. An inveterate scene-stealer, she weathers strong
competition this time in a movie crammed with clever conversation and
pungent zingers. As coarse but well-meaning Birdie Coonan, a brash
ex-vaudevillian now the queen's ever-loyal ""drone"", Ritter's character
properly handles her boss's antics with amusing grit and backbone. On the
periphery of this Broadway beehive is mop-faced Gregory Ratoff as an edgy,
gullible, thick-accented producer, Marilyn Monroe as a hopelessly vacuous
starlet, and Barbara Bates, as a novice schemer with a very bright future,
all making their few scenes count -- especially Bates, who is forever
enshrined in the film's stunning final shot.The chief thorn in Margo's (and everybody's) side, and the other real star
of this picture, is the queen's titular lady-in-waiting, Eve Harrington.
As
played by Anne Baxter, this role is probably the most delicate and
difficult
of all for the weight and believability of this drama falls squarely on
her
shoulders. Unfairly overlooked all these years by the flashier posturings
of Davis, Baxter does a beautiful job of drawing initial pathos then panic
as she slowly unveils her own lethal stinger. By film's end, Baxter is
directly on par with her scenery-chewing co-star. Killer to killer.
Champion to champion.Six Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director (Joseph L. Mankiewicz),
Best Screenplay (also Mankiewicz) and Supporting Actor (George Sanders)
went
to this cinematic bon mot. Had Bette Davis and Anne Baxter not competed
as
Best Actress (Baxter refused to place herself in the Supporting Actress
category), it would have drummed up two more awards to be sure.Developing a faithful cult following over the years, this film deserves to

1054,9.333333333333334,6.3,"Alien Nation is a cross over between Sci-Fi and the 'buddy cop' genre.
What separates this from the usual buddy film is that instead of the
difference being ethnic/class/gender, it is human (James Caan) and
alien (Mandy Patinkin).The clichéd beginning with the main character's partner being killed is
done very well with stylish gunplay and set pieces. Caan really shines
in the action scenes and it is great to see him in such a tough guy
role. Caan is a great actor and can do more than macho as he shows in
the scenes involving his daughter when Caan displays remorse, making
the audience feel more sympathetic towards him. Caan aside, the cast is
fairly mediocre, full of average actors except Terrence Stamp who puts
on a good show as the bad guy.Something I loved about this film is how similar everything is to The
Terminator. This is due to the film being produced by Gale Ann Hurd and
there being other members of the Terminator crew present. Like
Terminator, Alien Nation greatly benefits from the dark, murky feel of
the environment, giving it an edge over a lot of Sci-Fi films which
suffer from being too 'shiny'.The film does a great job at exploring racism, giving the impression of
time repeating itself regarding the Western civilisations treatment of
blacks when they were forced in to the country. Caan's conversion from
despising the ""Newcomers"" to accepting them is admirable and
convincing. It is not an overnight change and it is done discretely,
very convincing.As with a lot of escapism films, you can not take Alien Nation too
seriously so it is best to approach this film with an open mind and
desire to be entertained rather than wishing to be introspective. A
very well made, enjoyable film.",91,1988
1055,9.75,6.1,"There's an inherent problem with making a movie of this kind: unless
you're a creative genius of your time, these sorts of movies have the
potential to turn real generic, REAL fast. Reminiscent of Denzel Washington from Training Day, we see Samuel L.
Jackson play an overly aggressive cop with an agenda, with the movie
focusing on the problems he's causing for his new neighbors. A
completely realistic situation that can take place anywhere. Problem
is, because a movie like this is completely character driven, after you
have the nice slow build up to the climax, once the tension snaps,
you're relegated to basically a generically default final act of the
movie where ""the bad guy finally comes out of the proverbial shadows
and literally chases the hero."" (i.e. Disturbia, The Glass House). It's
a shame too because the buildup on this was very good. Samuel L.
Jackson was really scary here, he played that bullying, obsessive
character perfect. The only acting problems I saw were 2-3 moments from
Kerry Washington where her sad face was done poorly, with overly done
lip quivers and facial movements (similar to Kirsten Dunst's crying
scenes from the Spider-Man movies, except done in a BAD way).With a movie like this, you pretty much have these possible outcomes: 1) the generic, semi-predictable ending (like we got here). 2) tragic
ending with hero dying at the end. 3) an unpredictable twist coming out
of left field (this has the potential to be very good or very bad). 4)
a Great ending.Unfortunately we usually get number one, since they wanna give the
satisfying, safe, effective, tried and true, Hollywood ending. Most

1056,10.333333333333334,6.6,"Director William Lustig followed up his classic ""Maniac"" with this
equally potent thriller. Robert Forster offers an interesting, low key
portrayal of Eddie Marino, a blue collar guy whose wife and son are
savagely attacked by loathsome punks. When Eddie realizes that he
cannot rely on the ""justice"" system - including a crooked defense
attorney (""Maniac"" star Joe Spinell, in an amusing cameo) and an
incompetent judge (Vincent Beck), he finally takes a friend, Nick (Fred
""The Hammer"" Williamson), up on his offer to help clean up the streets.
The tone is set up very well right away, as The Hammer addresses us all
and delivers a monologue bemoaning the level of crime and violence in
the modern world. One can indeed see that he and his associates, Ramon
(Joseph Carberry) and Burke (Richard Bright), himself a former cop,
don't necessarily ENJOY what they do, but see it as being necessary,
stressing the basic human right to not have to live in fear. And Lustig
and company pull no punches when it comes to the depravity of our
antagonists' crimes, not being afraid to cross the line of what might
constitute good taste. At the very least, the movie is decent,
reasonably gripping entertainment that explores that oft visited theme
of what the average person is capable of doing once they've finally
been pushed too far. As in ""Maniac"", the use of the various NYC
locations is excellent, and there are some great chase sequences and
scenes of strong violence. The widescreen photography (it's cool that
this movie was shot in the Panavision aspect ratio) is impressive; the
haunting and catchy main theme by composer Jay Chattaway may very well
stick in the viewer's head a while after the movie has ended. The good
supporting cast is also a big help, featuring such performers as
Rutanya Alda as Eddie's wife Vickie, Don Blakely as despicable lowlife
Prago, salsa music legend Willie Colon as gang leader Rico, Carol
Lynley as the ineffective district attorney, the awesome Woody Strode

received some criticisms on the pace and the low sense of humour but
still managed to pull off a profitable $500,000 at the local ticket box

the vast number of readers of the illustrated novel series of the same

theatrical release in view of March school holidays. Typically, the young readers can relate to the obligatory activities
and school life of Greg and friends. There must be someone in school

whether it's the quirky behaviours of the kids, the older brother
Rodrick or even the Heffley parents. Comparing it to other movies in
the same league, this movie stands out with better humour. One of the
potential pitfalls of a family movie is having jokes that are too hard
for children understand. In this case, they manage to dodge away from
the potential pitfall as the jokes are pretty relatable to the
children. Even the adults cannot help but to laugh at the goofiness.
Enjoy some simple and good humour! One of the important factors that
helped to increase the entertainment value was the 2-D sketches. They
were incorporated seamlessly into the storyline and are both intriguing
and eye-catching.As suggested by the title, this movie is more focused on the brothers'
relationship, a further development from the first movie of the series.
Rodrick was more than an annoyance; he showed the ""older brother"" side
more this time. Be it manipulating his little brother to achieve his
motives, or embarrassing his little brother for his own pleasure, or
even to passing on his little brother the ""good"" stuffs aren't these
again, pretty relatable to everyone? Exactly, we're back to it again:
relevancy of the movie is indeed the biggest selling point of the
movie.As the movie winds up, it continues to stir our interest and leads us
to a less sighted side of the brothers which is dear and heart-warming
to watch. Upon watching, you'll probably nod to yourself and say
'indeed, blood is thicker than water'. Despite the older brother not
wanting to befriend his little brother initially, at the end of the day
he is still always there for him and vice versa. With more diaries to
come, this series will definitely gain greater popularity among the
young readers.- www.moviexclusive.com",0,2011
1064,14.0,4.3,"Well, call me odd but I enjoyed Pod very much. On reading the other
reviews for this film I realise that leaves me in the minority but I
like what I like. As others have pointed out the first half of this short-ish movie (76
minutes run time) is primarily conflict and dialogue between three
siblings, each of which have their own baggage. However, while some may
find that to be a drag and want to get straight to the beastie the film
is named for, I lapped it up. Until said beastie hits the screen Pod plays out like a psychological
drama. Martin, an ex soldier with a history of emotional illness and
delusions, appears to have gone completely over the edge when he
insists he has captured a murderous alien creature and locked it in his
basement. Older brother Ed, a psychologist, and Lyla, the vulnerable
younger sister show up to try and coax Martin into getting some much
needed help.Considering the subject matter and the circumstances the tension
between these three characters is, to me, believable and well crafted.
The characters have depth, the dialogue was terrific and while the
shadowy Smith, who shows up toward the end of the film is perhaps,
deliberately bland, being some kind of military spook, I really enjoyed
the family members and their dynamics. Brian Morvant and Lauren Ashley
Carter's performances were both stand outs. As for Pod himself, well.. he was pretty cool though we've seen his ilk
before on the X Files and elsewhere. Nonetheless, i don't believe this
movie was intended to be just a horror/sci-fi flick. That may well be
why many reviewers got bored with the it; too much angst and talk and
not enough CGI and gore. For a suspense/horror flick with some intelligence you could do a lot
worse than Pod.",76,2015
1065,8.5,7.2,"Disney`s version of 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA is rightly remembered for
the classic scene featuring the giant squid , but it should be remembered
for more than that . Captain Nemo is a wonderfully written anti-hero who`s
what would be described nowadays as an environmentalist , but don`t dare
confuse him with being some sort of yogurt knitting tree hugger because this
is a man waging a violent crusade against warmongers and anyone else he sees
fit to exterminate . It`s a really intriguing character study and Nemo is
played superbly by James Mason . Compare Mason`s performance as Nemo to that
of Steven Seagal`s role as ecowarrior Forrest Taft in ON DEADLY GROUND .
Done so ? A laughable contrast isn`t it . Kirk Douglas may disappoint as Ned
Land but his real function is to act as a physical square jawed hero
alongside the academic and somewhat ambigious Professor Arronnax.I also appreciated the fact that Disney resisted the temptation to invent a
child character in order to make the film appeal to children more by way of
audience identification , nor is there any sort of mawkish sentiment or
frivolity that`s spoiled many a Disney film . In fact this is such an
exciting thoughtful adventure if it wasn`t for the presence of a seal I
wouldn`t have believed it was a Disney film .Did I mention there`s a great battle with a giant squid

that it isn't even a movie, but instead a DVD project as it has a
rather leaden history. But though there was no theatrical release to
garner public interest and little promotional material about its shelf
release, it may just find an audience among word of mouth promotion. It
has enough elements to keep the interest of even late at night tired
viewers - and that says a lot these days. Elmore Leonard's novel has
been reconstructed by Hossein Amini and John Madden has done his best
to string together the various beads of the plots that comprise this
story, and the result is a film peppered by some worthwhile actors who
do their best to make the implausible story lines work. Armand 'Blackbird' Degas (Mickey Rourke) is a long time hit-man, an
American Indian with a past pasted together by tragedies who accepts an
assignment to make a new kill. His plan is disrupted by his accidental
and maladaptive association with a bona fide psychopath Richie Nix
(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and girlfriend Donna (Rosario Dawson). Nix
decides to partner with Blackbird and in the process they encounter a
'couple on the rocks' - Carmen and Wayne Colson (Thomas Jane and Diane
Lane) - who happen to witness an incident that puts them in danger of
Nix and Blackbird's recipe for not leaving witnesses. The couple is put
on Witness Protection Program but that doesn't dent the clever
Blackbird from accomplishing his goals. The rest of the story is a cat
and mouse chase that has some moments of real terror. And as in most of
Leonard's stories, things don't turn out the way they seem to suggest. Things are missing from this film that create holes in the story and
stretch credibility. The work by the lead actors is quite good as is
that of the momentary cameos by such luminaries as Hal Holbrook and
Lois Smith. A great film this is not, but a film that maintains
attention/tension it is and worth an evening's entertainment. Grady

1067,12.666666666666666,7.6,"This movie is extremely well made. Make sure you get the original
director's cut, or Special Edition as they are calling it on the DVD. It
includes the real ending, along with more than 20 minutes of additional
footage. The morons from the studio in Hollywood decided that the public
wouldn't want to see a nearly 3-hour underwater adventure, and forced James
Cameron to cut it down and change the ending. The ending the studios
insisted on is your typical boring old done-a-million-times happy ending,
and does not work. It betrays the message of the film, and makes it
nothing
more than a good underwater shoot-em-up. This movie is much more than
that.
See the REAL ending to understand why it is so important to this film. As
opposed to the canned studio ending, the REAL one makes you think. Well,
what did you expect? Hollywood executives make movies for the common herd,
they dumb them down to make sure every patron goes away feeling happy. God
forbid that anyone actually may have to think a little. At the time,
despite a few solid hits (such as the original Terminator), James Cameron
wasn't enough of a power in La-La land to force the studios to release the
movie as he wanted it to be. After Titanic, they will do whatever he says,
so we can now expect some great Cameron films to look forward to, rather
than having to wait for the REAL movie to come out years later on a Special

television once. I can't remember what attracted me to seeing it, but
it was a surprisingly good movie. Eric Roberts showed the industry that
he can act and be very convincing. The central actors must have studied
gypsy life because they pulled it off very well. The film is mostly
about the tension of the next successor to the throne (Judd Hirsch) and
his son (Eric Roberts) whom the present King (Sterling Hayden) favors
as his actual successor. Hirsch plays a cold, scheming character who
finally does one of the most despicable acts a person can do, and shows
no remorse for it. This, in turn, sparks retaliation from his son. If I

1070,4.0,5.4,"City Heat casts two of Hollywood's biggest box office draws of the past
forty years in the same film as different types. The film is set in
Kansas City of 1933 which richly earned the reputation it had back in
the day of a wide open town. This was in fact the Kansas City of Tom
Pendergast. Clint Eastwood is a by the book and honest city detective,
not an easy thing to be in Kansas City of that era. Burt Reynolds is a
former cop who's now a roguish private eye. The two of them have a
history, they like each other well enough, but they also grate on each
other's nerves.As all good private eyes have, Burt has a cool and efficient Effie like
secretary in Jane Alexander and a partner in Richard Roundtree. Burt's
one of the few back in the day who would even consider going into
business with a black person. But Roundtree's playing a lone hand
involving a runaway bookkeeper and a war between two rival mobs headed
by Rip Torn and Tony LoBianco. For his troubles Roundtree winds up dead
and in the same tradition of Sam Spade, when your partner's killed you
do something about it.But it's also Eastwood's homicide case and like it or not the two are
forced into an alliance of inconvenience, kicking and screaming right
up to the end of the picture. The plot also calls for rescuing
Alexander who Eastwood fancies, Madeline Kahn who's Burt's girlfriend
and chanteuse Irene Cara.City Heat is not at the top of the list of films by Eastwood and
Reynolds. But they've got nothing to be ashamed of here. The film
glides effortlessly from comedy to drama and both guys get their
innings to show why they're the superstars they are. You could do a lot
worse than City Heat for your viewing pleasure.",93,1984
1071,9.75,5.4,"This is the last movie that Charles Bronson made before the death of
his second wife, actress Jill Ireland. At 68 and with a string of
mediocre action thrillers littering his 1980s output, this sleazy cop
movie turned out to be one of his better efforts of the decade. Bronson
plays vice detective Crowe, a racist veteran of the force who has grown
weary of seeing the scum of Los Angeles dragging innocent children into
prostitution and drugs. A parallel storyline follows visiting Japanese
businessman Hiroshi Hada (James Pax) who struggles to adapt to American
values and soon after arriving loses his young daughter to slimy pimp
Duke (Juan Fernandez). Crowe has already had run-ins with Duke, so when
he is assigned to find Hada's daughter, the stories merge with tragic
results. Bronson is still trim and performs well as Crowe, with several
good action sequences. Largely maligned as an actor because he
underplayed his leading roles, Bronson always fit this type of role
because you could believe that he actually does the things he is
portraying. There is a nice little scene involving an ethnic event
where Crowe vents his frustration on some startled Japanese that speaks
volumes about character motivation. Juan Fernandez is exceptional as
Duke and makes his character truly evil. Veteran British director J.
Lee Thompson does a fair job of keeping the movie plugging along and
has a great set piece at the end of the movie involving a crane and
crashing automobiles. The subject matter isn't as exploited as it could
have been, but it's still pretty rough and loaded with nudity and
violence. Bronson fans won't be disappointed and even non-fans (like my
wife) enjoyed it.",97,1989

awful crap I will sit through from beginning to end and this is
certainly one of those times. I never watched the first movie, as I'd
been warned away from it vehemently by another movie buff. I thought,
however, as a second film had been made, perhaps the budget would be
larger and the cast and crew may have learned a few things further down
the line production-wise. Boy, was I wrong. At least, I can't think the
first one could be any worse than this film. I literally paused it
firstly to take out the bins and then to wash the dishes to break up
the monotony of it all.What a wreck. There is nothing redeemable about this movie and I
watched this one right after Sharkansas Women's Prison Massacre. That
was also terrible, but a masterpiece by comparison. After fifteen
minutes of The Hospital 2, I thought maybe a beer would make it better.
Then it was a couple of gin and tonics. Surely that would help, right?
Nope. No amount of self-medication could put a band-aid on this injury.

1074,4.25,7.0,"Pee-wee's Big Adventure (the first full-length feature by acclaimed
film-maker Tim Burton) is the kind of movie you'd have to force yourself
NOT
to like. Adapted from Paul Reubens' hit children's (and adult's)
television
show, it is a delightful fantasy that is bound to entertain. The tagline
for
the film describes it as ""the story of a rebel and his bike,"" and that
really about sums up the entire movie, but there's something about Pee-wee
that taps into everyone's inner child and captures the care-freeness of
youth, making his adventures irresistible and utterly captivating ...
because -- afterall -- Pee-wee is still the coolest man-child out there
(take THAT, Michael Jackson!). The plot (which is really rather
insignificant) revolves around Pee-wee's prized bike, which is tragically
stolen while he's shopping for novelty toys at the mall (who DOESN'T wish
they had this man's life?). After deciding that the police couldn't
possibly
help him in his endeavors, he ""takes the law into his own hands"" and sets
out on a quest to find his bicycle -- which a phony fortune-teller has
told
him is in the basement of the Alamo. The film can be enjoyed on a number
of
levels: while there is always the sheer fun and hilarity of Reubens comic
genius, there is another genius at work here -- Burton's. One of the many
pleasures of watching a Burton movie is that you can tell you're watching
a
movie by a man who's watched a lot of movies, and each feature of his is
drenched with homages, parodies, and inside jokes: Pee-wee's Big Adventure
features references to beach blanket movies, horror movies, Godzilla
movies,
Tarzan movies, and even The Wizard of Oz. The other great thing about
Burton
is that he always adds a dark edge to his work, regardless of how flippant
the work may be: when Pee-wee's bike is stolen, it's a moment of almost
Hitchcockian intensity. Burton's playful use of shadows and cartoonish set
pieces conveys a sense of simultaneous lightheartedness and malice; his
films accomplish that rare feat of creating a world entirely of their own.
But even if all of this film-geek babble means absolutely nothing to you,
you can still have fun on this adventure, because Pee-wee is one of the
most
likable characters in the history of entertainment: anyone who claims to
find Reubens obnoxious or unfunny is either lying to you or has no sense
of
humor. The screenplay for Pee-wee's Big Adventure was written by Reubens
and
Saturday Night Live alumni Phil Hartman, and its combination of childish
humor (""I know you are, but what am I?"") and unexpected insight is
absolutely charming. With top-notch direction and full-blown hilarity (the
""Tequila"" scene is one for the time capsule), it is one of the most purely
enjoyable films ever made; it's that rare cult movie that's just as good
as
its fans would tell you it is. So go on: give into your temptation and
watch
it. As Pee-wee himself would say, ""I triple-dog-dare ya"" not to like
it.Grade: B",91,1985

newer designs, they incorporated older aspects - the planet REALLY
looked like a better version of one of their old sets.Furthermore, Oldman managed to peg Dr. Smith perfectly, taking in all
the old camp elements and putting them to very good use - even using
some old catch phrases in different ways.As diversionary, light sci-fi adventure goes, I thought this was great

1076,12.0,6.1,"Fresh out of the cinema I have a very good feeling about the movie. My
first impression is that it is definitely worth seeing. Alex de la
Iglesia (the director of for instance ""El Dia de la Bestia"" or ""La
comunidad"") makes this time a mystery movie following the classical
parameters. A nice plot, specially for those who like mathematics or
logic in general, with intricate moves and very nice dialogs by John
Hurt and Eliah Wood (who, by the way, looks like a pretty solid actor.
I had only seen him playing Frodo and was a bit worried about him
getting stuck on that character, not at all) who basically follow the
classical thoughts about ""the perfect murder"" and in the philosophical
search for absolute truths.Being a fan of de la Iglesia, whose sense of humor is well known and
pretty easy to recognize, I am quite happy to see that he is also able
of making a genuine mystery film, with everything you expect to see on
it, twisted arguments, funny characters (""Podorov"", and of course,
Dominique Pinon from, among others, Delicatessen) and a extremely good
film-making, nice sequences, good mystery music, etc.To me, being a bit of a geek, the mathematical references are too
obvious, the series shown are too well known, they are nice
nonetheless, but for instance why to talk about Fibonaci numbers (which
were also in the 'Da Vinci Code' when one can talk about many other
nice and funny series? On the other hand being a mystery movie's lover
one always enjoys the sequences which are clear homage's to previous
classics, pay attention and you'll enjoy.Let me end up by mentioning the very nice work of Leonor Watling (you
may have seen her before in, for example Almodovar's ""Talk to her"", her
meaning she), who, apart from being a really good actress, of being
extremely beautiful and attractive is also a pretty good singer! It was
quite a pleasure, being Spanish myself, to see her playing an important
role with such a great casting! So, watch it by yourself, the first ""serious"" Alex de la Iglesia movie,
and he does a pretty good job!",104,2008

'Oh, so that's what this is all about??'Yes this is what this movie is all about, Robert De Niro's dirty
grandpa character who has just lost his wife of 40 years, is now
revealed to be a foul mouthed, booze obsessed pervert who wants to f*ck
young girls. Its up to the young, clean cut and unaware Jason (Efron)
to escort him from Georgia to his Florida retirement home. Aaand that's
your movie in a nutshell people, sound familiar? well that's probably
because its been done a sh*tzillion times before.I mean honesty, who thought of this? who green-lit it? The entire
concept is so cliché and dated, an old grandfather figure that turns
out to be a dirty, loud mouthed, profanity spewing perv who also just
happens to be an ex-special forces type so he can also kick ass if
needs be. This of course means you're gonna get a sequence where he
does indeed kick someone's ass much to the surprise of Jason his
grandson. Naturally of course, the fact that grandpa is an ass-
kicking, alcohol machine, means that the grandson character must be a
total goodie goodie, a real preppy nerd type because its the perfect
equal polar opposite match-up. Completely and utterly predictable,
clichéd, corny and unoriginal, the characters literally lay out the
ground plan for the plot without even having to write a single word of
dialog for them. And yes you've guessed it, that plot simply revolves around lots and
lots and lots of binge drinking at parties, girls in skimpy bikinis,
pool parties, beach parties, drinking, drugs, lame pranks, drinking,
sex, nudity, drinking, jail time, muscle flexing and plenty of
drinking. This is basically the modern frat boy flick minus any
originality because frat boy flicks were a staple diet back in the
80's. So this odd pairing drive off on this road trip of sorts in an
attempt to reach Florida. God knows how far they actually get because
the entire flick is taken up with the duo getting into various parties
so grandpa can try and get laid. This is against the wishes of a
shocked Jason of course but he usually ends up getting tricked or
drugged into it, then winds up enjoying it, then winds up waking up
somewhere hungover and naked...or in jail, take your pick. The whole
time Jason is also trying to hide all this outrageous behaviour from
his very sexy, yet very prudish fiancée and his conservative parents.
Anyway all I know is at one point they get to Daytona beach in Florida,
no clue how they got there or how far they still had to go, but who
cares.Now in all honesty the casting for grandpa Dick with De Niro is pretty
good. De Niro is the obviously the perfect age and he has that perfect
persona where you're not really sure what he's actually like, he could
easily be a dark horse. To that extent De Niro does the job well, as we
know he's great at swearing and being tough, he still looks pretty
tough, and he fits the rough ex-services persona well also. For all
intense and purposes he could easily be playing yet another mobster
type in a comedy, he never really swings too far from that schtick. As
for Jason played by Efron, well to be honest the guy is too good
looking and too muscular for this part. He isn't too bad with his comic
timing and everything (surprisingly!), but when it came to sequences
like the 'flex-off' on the beach and when he's generally topless, he's
way too ripped! That's not a bad thing but I really think to get the
right comedic affect they should of cast someone without a good
physique, with bad hair, someone who's a bit geeky looking. That would
at least be a good opposite to the rest of beach/party going extras who
are generally all sexy boys and girls. The fact that Efron is way
hotter than all of them kinda makes most of the sexual innuendo gags
fall flat.I must point out one character played by some bloke called Jason
Mantzoukas. Oh my f*cking God this guy was so f*cking annoying I could
of killed him, literally killed him. Who is this guy? where did he come
from? why is he being cast in movies? is he supposed to be a funny guy?
Holy sh*tstains this guy was dreadful, completely unfunny, everything
just fell flat or totally missed the target by miles. His whole drug
obsession spiel was just so f*cking clichéd, so old, so not funny! Yeah
its so cool and amusing to do drugs or pretend to do drugs ha-ha-ha!
Jesus Christ I was giggling at sh*t like this when I was a kid back in
the mid 80's. Then you have the two corrupt cops, one male and one
female, played by whoever, I don't care. Once again, completely not
funny, not even close, just cringeworthy on every level, literally
amateurish.Yeah so bottom line, this is a piece of sh*t, an unfunny piece of
modern day movie garbage. Not even De Niro or Efron's perfectly tanned
torso can save this, its dribble of epic proportions with not a laugh
in sight. That is of course...the thought of seeing De Niro's cock in
Efron's face sounds good to you? Or 72 year old De Niro's character
having sex with a supposed 20 something college student (Lenore) and
then having a kid together (making Efron's character the uncle to his
grandfathers newborn son and a college slut his new grandmother). Oh
and then there's the real classy dialog between grandpa Dick and
Lenore...'You're gonna tsunami on my face', 'You're gonna flood like
the Nile', Nice.2/10",0,2016

fellow here, didn't watch any 'classics' horror movies but I do enjoy
horror movies in general as long as they are not just gore type of
movies. I'd say my favorite horror movies are The Ring and The
Conjuring.So, past that to The Witch. I'd start by saying the movie was not what the trailer lead me to
believe. This is not as much about scary moments or jump scare and more
about a family coping with a lost child, and the movie trying to build
suspense and just make the viewer feel uncomfortable. Because of this,
I can see why some people will see it as really really slow with not
much happening.Some PLUSES for me: - Anya Taylor-Joy (the older daughter) is amazing
in this movie and I also think Ralph Ineson (the father) did a good
job. - the score is really really good, there are periods of intense
silence and periods of creepy music at just the right times to build
tension - the cinematography with nice wide shots combined with the
score works really well in most momentsFor the MINUSES: - I felt like the other child's acting was pretty bad
and over the top and just took me out of the movie in most scenes where
they are the focus (thankfully there were not THAT many) - a bit too
slow of a pacing during the first half even for my tasteSo, just like I said in the title, KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. If
you go and expect your typical horror movie with jump scares and a
hidden 'baddie' slowly revealing itself along the movie in scary
scenes, THIS IS NOT IT. This is mostly a family drama that tries to
build suspense and make the viewer feel uneasy.On a side note, I caught this on a premiere showing with a theatre half
full and the occasional comments, coughs and even laughter from some
'individuals' took me out of some moments. If you do want to watch this
in the cinemas, I would recommend waiting and going way past premieres
and on a awkward day / time so you have the cinema close to empty. Or,
if you have a sweet setup at home with a good sound system, I would
just watch it at home.",92,2015

more immediate. Though, if you're after blood-splattering action, you
might be disappointed as this is more a character piece. Interesting

1082,4.5,6.5,"Once upon a time, Channel 9 in New York featured the Million
DollarMovie, which ran one movie all day long for a full day, a
programming technique that has been copied by modern cable and
satellite TV's in their endless repeats of movies and shows. But in the early 70's, before the invention of the VCR, Channel 9 was a
film student's dream in that he or she could watch a movie over and
over for one day and really study it. Beat Girl arrived on Channel 9, a few years after its run in British
and, presumably, American theaters. I watched about eight hours of Beat
Girl, in the generous, endless loop provided by Channel 9. This movie
fascinated the 13-yr.-old me who had never encountered such rebellion
and hostility on the part of a school-aged daughter towards her father,
who has returned from a trip with a step mother for whom the daughter
is unprepared.At 13, rebellious, unhappy, and edgy, I needed a ""bad-girl"" paradigm,
and this movie supplied me with her. I loved the heroine and despised
anyone who would stand in her way. She left such an impression on me
that I have been fascinated by ""bad girls"" ever since.However, the film is so bad -- or good, depending on your point of view
of gritty, early 60s ""To Sir, With Love"" England -- that you might want
to stick around to see what happens to this sullen chick who's
accompanied by some stoner boys to some bad jazz music. Or not: this is
one low budget film with fairly terrible acting but there is a gritty
earnestness to this film.Look for Oliver Reed, John McHenery, and Adam Faith in secondary roles.
As in all of 50/60 flicks. look for a moral -- but look for the moments
of rebellion, too. And dig that crazy music.",0,1960

young age, Jolene (Chastain) deals with getting over the past and
finding herself. She sets off on a journey across the country looking
for what is missing in her life. This is a very, very good
coming-of-age story, also kind of inspiring in a way, no matter what
happens to her she never gets down and keeps pushing forward. On the
other hand it is also pretty depressing to watch what this girl goes
through. This movie does a great job of showing what a girl, who was
raised as an orphan and spent her youth between the home and foster
parents, acts like. Though it's not her first movie the woman who plays
Jolene (Jessica Chastain) is fantastic in this. It's not an easy role,
especially with as much sex and nudity involved (nothing gratuitous, it
actually helps define the character), along with the ranges of emotion
she must portray. I'm really surprised she didn't get any recognition
for this. I don't want to give too much away, but I really, really
enjoyed this movie. I give it an A.Would I watch it again? - I did already.",121,2008
1084,11.8,7.4,"A modern remake of the 1940s film, ""Double Indemnity,"" this movie has a
solid, large fan base of its own. That's justifiable, too, because this
is well done.It sports a 1940s-type film noir soundtrack but the rest is purely
1980s. By that, I mainly mean nudity and profanity, although the
language isn't that offensive.Kathleen Turner plays a femme fatale, similar to Barbara Stanwyck's
role with Fred MacMurray in ""Double Indemnity,"" except with a different
ending. Actually, the entire story is quite different from the classic
film noir. William Hurt has MacMurray's male lead role. I liked the
classic actors better but Turner and Hurt shine with their
performances, too.This is steamy movie to say the least. Set on hot, humid Florida summer
nights, you can almost feel the heat coming out from the TV screen and
the heat from the two leads going at it several times. Turner is
excellent as a woman who will go to great lengths for money, as they
sometimes do. (Hey, my 87-year-old father is dating a 24-year bimbo in
Florida, so I know of where I speak.)The story is divided into three segments: (1) the setup; (2) the
romance and plotting of the crime and (3) the crime and unraveling of
Hurt as things begin to go very wrong.An intriguing film, this loses nothing with multiple viewings. It's
always interesting. The more I watched this, the more I found - as the
case frequently is - myself fascinated with some of the lesser
characters such as Hurt's two friends, played by Ted Danson and J.A.
Preston. Danson, by the way, gives us a preview of the amoral character
he played later in the hit TV series, ""Cheers.""This is the kind of film you snuggle up with someone on a cold winter

rappers have best-sellers based on the borrowed riff or refrain from an
eighties classic. And they pull it off. The question is - did this
movie get a fair shake in being rated as average? This simply means
that some liked it and some did not. But slashing it for merely what it
reflects is like smashing the mirror on a bad hair day. The movie is a
love story. It's a simple plot, and when one sits back and reflects on
it, it pulls off the simple plot. It is low budget, yes, but in a good
way. Bad CGI and silly effects would not have added to the love story,
but to the SciFi wrapper. And who eats the wrapper and writes a review

main actors do perform their own stunts and combat sequences which

it is so realistic. At times you actually forget that you are watching

claim is that a degree of human casualties and suffering may be the
optimal path to a better world, especially when the alternative is
equally brutal chaos. This is not a popular theme. It has become much
more fashionable to be anti-war in all cases. And understandably so,
since variations of this logic have often been used in the past to
justify atrocities. But the film provides a crisp litmus test for
avoiding delusion: action must be taken with a heart void of malice and
an unwavering commitment to the broadest possible ultimate outcome of
good for all. Can anyone live up to this standard? Several characters
in the movie do, each in their own way. If the standard could be met,
would the world be a better place? These are questions worth reflecting

1097,4.333333333333333,7.4,"""Lust for Life"", Vincente Minnelli's rich interpretation of Irving
Stone's Vincent Van Gogh bio-novel, is a film both compelling and
repelling; in delving into the psyche of the artist (unforgettably
portrayed by Kirk Douglas), one can see an untrained, unbridled genius
smashing convention to open viewers' eyes to a world defined by
passion; yet in doing so, we share in the growing nightmares and agony
of his creative mind, teetering toward the madness that would destroy
him, and it is an unsettling experience, to be sure! This is a film so rich in visual imagery (with a Technicolor 'palette'
that attempts to recreate Van Gogh's view of his world), that it
demands repeated viewings, just to savor the details. From wheat fields
'aflame' in color, to night skies that nearly writhe in waves of
darkness, the elemental nature of the artist's vision is spectacularly
captured. And in experiencing the world through his eyes, the loving,
yet uncomprehending concern of his brother (James Donald), and more
hedonistic, shallow patronizing, and gradual disgust of fellow artist
Paul Gauguin (Anthony Quinn, in his Oscar-winning performance), become
elemental 'barriers', as well. Van Gogh wants to 'speak', but no one
can understand his 'language', not even the artist, himself! Kirk Douglas never plunged as deeply into a portrayal as he did, in
""Lust for Life"", and the experience nearly crushed him, as he related
in his autobiography, ""Ragman's Son"". His total immersion in the role
SHOULD have won him an Oscar (Yul Brynner won, instead, for ""The King
and I""), and his bitterness and disappointment at the snub would haunt
him, to this day. With the passage of time, his performance has only
increased in luster and stature, and it certainly shows an actor at the
top of his form! ""Lust for Life"" is an unforgettable experience, not to be missed!",122,1956

Vietnam War. The viewer witnesses a young soldier get shot. Next we see

son in Vietnam, and are trying to cope with this. In the middle of
their dinner, they get the news that he has been killed in battle. The
grieving process begins. But Andy comes home in the middle of the
night! They assume that the messenger was mistaken and celebrate their
son's return. However, Andy is very different to them--he is ostensibly
emotionless and doesn't say much. And he's a little pale. And more than
a little violent.***slight plot spoilers ahead, though not anything you don't know from
reading the plot summary or the back of the DVD*** This has to be one of the most depressing horror movies I've seen. I
suppose it could be classified as a zombie movie (even though there is
only one ""zombie""), and in the tradition of NOTLD, this one has a
message. Everyone knows someone who returned from war a different
person. Not only is Andy emotionally numb, he also needs to kill in
order to ""survive,"" just as he did while he was at war. The family,
which was fragile before his return, is now completely torn apart. The
dad drinks, mom is in denial, sis insists on making things like ""the
good ole days,"" and they all fight about Andy, who has nothing much to
say at all.***slight plot spoilers over*** This low-budge production has a made-for-TV feel, but it isn't by any
means a bad movie. The performances are mostly great. There are some
amusing events and dialogue that seem somewhat out of place, but I was
thankful for the comic relief. There are also some cheesy and overdone
elements, but they don't affect the movie too much. There is also the
""killer's viewpoint"" camera-work (which Bob Clark also uses in Black
Christmas), that became staples of 80s slashers. The climax seems
absurd, but that is only because with all the melodrama, it is easy to
forget that this is a horror movie! The final sequence is
heartbreaking. I highly recommend Deathdream to anyone who thinks that
horror movies are only for escapism and have no other value, and
everyone who already knows that this isn't true. My rating: 8/10",88,1974

heard the bad reviews from critics but hell, who listens to them? While
watching this movie, I wasn't aware that The Invasion was re-filmed and
rewritten. Apparently they rewrote it to add the twist in the end, as
well as they added more action sequences with faster and better-angled
camera work.So the movie starts off right away with Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman)
scattering around the medicine cabinet in a Pharmacy whispering ""stay
awake, don't fall asleep"" to herself. The neat fast-paced camera work
kept you right into the movie from the beginning, but sadly the amazing
beginning just doesn't match up to the pathetic ending. It seemed like
they got tired of writing the movie so they decided to end it off with
a simply and quick ending.Some organism from a different planet crashed down to Earth and took
over the citizens of the world. When the organism comes in contact with
a human, they will become a different alien-ish like being obsessed
with capturing people and affecting the world with their plague. When
each person was affected, they would turn into these emotionless,
mindless and painless zombies while they sleep. In search of her son,
Carol Bennell gets affected and must stay awake so she would be able to
save her boy. With help from Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and his team
of doctors, they go on the search for a cure, to save humanity and
especially, save Carol.I find that this movie gave off the message it was trying to, but in
the process it failed at almost everything else. I was expecting,
before walking into this movie that it would be filled with suspense
with my heart jumping ever so often... but I wasn't scared or thrilled
once. The suspense scenes had great music playing, had the great camera
angles, but was just missing the spice to make it really work. And in
regards to the end of the movie... I can promise you the writers got
tired of having to rewrite a story and just through in a quick,
painless ending. Course the quick painless ending resulted in annoyance
for the audience.While I walked out of the theater, I was thinking about this movie and
how I would interpret it. One thing came to my head, and it was that
the new directors did what they were supposed to - make me think and
remember this movie once I leave the theater. This was NOT a
forgettable movie, rather quite memorable. Sure there was a bad ending,

Holocaust, which is the crippling effect of the Survivors' war
experiences on their children. Studies have shown that the children of
Nazi Holocaust Survivors share many if not all of their parents'
psychological issues, particularly depression and post-traumatic
stress. This film has the rare courage and honesty to show the bleak
emotional damage left by that war, not only on its direct victims but
on their children as well. The portrait of the mother is particularly
bitterly real -- her seemingly inexplicably outbursts and fits of
violence a near-mirror of the unexplained violence she witnessed as a
girl; her narcissism and coldness linked to her own abandonment as a
girl. Again, a poignant and tragic reality of the psychological
landscape of all survivors of war. The actors were superb, the dialogue
actually worth LISTENING to. Haas and Lucas put in beautifully nuanced
performances and Bisset was outstanding in arguably the best, most
emotional performance of her career, and looking more beautiful than

something like this ""Just remember it. Don't forget. Remember. And just

her dead in the bath tub. Frightened, she runs out and returns a few
minutes later. A man is now at the house, and he takes her to the
bathroom to show her there is no body. It was your imagination, he
assures her. She JUST saw the dead body, and yet he convinces her that
nothing happened. She comes back the next day to snoop around, and now
sees that the tub has a significant amount of blood in it. We
immediately cut to a scene of her wandering around town calling out her
friend's name, as if the girl had only been injured and might still be

normal feelings of sharing a lover with another.The funniest part is the surprise visit from the American girl's mother

the surface of all that and plays this for fun and laughter. It's just
good old-fashioned escapism along the lines of ""California Dreaming,""

had the impression it's merely meant for kids. On the contrary, most of
the dry humor and charismatic Garfield poses are difficult to 'get' for
young children. And yet, the film completely aims for a youthful
audience. I have no problem with a movie being pro-children, but this
is exaggerated and hardly accessible for adult viewers. The movie
totally lacks all the elements that make the comics so entertaining.
Garfield's clever and sarcastic remarks, Jon's clumsy womanizing
techniques All this has been replaced with an unhealthy dose of
feel-good messages and lame jokes. The computer engineered Garfield
doesn't appeal and the other, real pets are badly chosen. The plot is
standard-sentiment, with Garfield saving his new housemate puppy from a
sneaky, fame-chasing TV host. Breckin Meyer (as Jon Arbuckle) and
Jennifer Love Hewitt (as the yummy vet Liz) walk around without
anything to do and Bill Murray voices Garfield like it's some sort of
dire job he wants to get rid of asap. The first (long-awaited?) cinema
adventure of everybody's favorite cat appears to be a quickly produced
and unprofessional flick soon to be forgotten. Too bad, since you're
left behind with the feeling they could have done something better with
this.",80,2004
1111,12.0,5.3,"Doc Stoner(Strother Martin, who most know as the warden in COOL HAND
Luke who utters the famous line, ""What we got here is a failure to
communicate."")who has grown quite mad over the years, injects an
innocent, kind-hearted college student, David(Dirk Benedict;Face of
A-TEAM fame)with an inoculation that is slowly turning him into a King
Cobra. A missing student named Tim, we later find, was a tragic victim
of Stoner's experiments in ""tampering"" with evolution so that
civilization would continue after mankind was long past(..he's paranoid
with the fact that mankind, as we know it, is certainly on the verge of
collapse and extinction which fuels his obsessions with his work). What
Stoner doesn't expect is that his daughter/assistant Kristina(Heather
Menzies of PIRANHA fame)and David fall in love. Stoner, however, has
grown diabolical and will kill one male behind the death of his pet
snake and another quack doctor/professor, behind the school's granting
him the annual grant that keeps his career going, who understands what
he's up to regarding David, becoming lunch to his pet boa.Disturbing slow burning horror film works because we sympathize with
David's eventual plight. He has no clue, at first, what the doctor is
injecting him with. Also still, we witness David and Kristina's growing
love for one another. But, the true terror is seeing poor David's agony
and transformation as his insides and bone structure begin to shift.
The make-up effects work well enough even if they are a bit hokey by
today's standards. This film works more off the viewer's sympathies for
the victim and what horrific lengths Stoner goes to see his work
accomplished.",99,1973

sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films. I don't want to

1113,15.0,7.0,"20th Century Fox's 1941 production BLOOD & SAND is a remake of the 1922
silent classic that established Rudolph Valentino as the greatest star
of early cinema. Beautifully photographed in vivid 3 strip Technicolor
by Ernest Palmer and Ray Renahan the elaborate newer version had the
obvious heir-apparent to the silent screen star in dashing Tyrone
Power. Written for the screen by Jo Swerling from the novel by Vicente
Blasco Ibanez it was directed with a certain amount of flair, it has to
be said, by Rouben Mamoulian who just the previous year had had his
greatest success with Tyrone Power when he directed him in the classic
""Mark Of Zorro""BLOOD & SAND recounts the story of a young, ambitious and quite naive
bullfighter Juan Gallardo (Power) who falls under the spell of a
beauteous and attractive socialite (Rita Hayworth) wrecking his
relationship with Carmen (Linda Darnell) the girl who has always loved
him since childhood. The picture culminates with Juan discovering too
late that he is only a toy for the manipulative socialite. And finally
in the end when he is gored by a bull in the ring it is the forgiving
Carmen, his only true love, that comes to his side to comfort him as he
lays dying.BLOOD & SAND was a very popular picture of the War years and remains a
great favourite with Power devotees. However I have to confess to never
being very fond of it. There is little doubt Ty Power is good as the
aspiring Matador and Hayworth chews up every bit of scenery in sight as
the alluring Donna Sol. But with the exception of Anthony Quinn and
that memorable dance sequence he does with Hayworth I found the rest of
the cast - particularly the young actor Rex Downing who played Juan as
a boy - unconvincing and altogether uninspiring. In fact the whole
picture for me was curiously uninvolving! Also Juan being gored by the
bull towards the end is very badly done! You don't really see what
happens to him. Was he gored in the back or the front? It is very
difficult to decipher. And he appears very clean and unmarked in his
ensuing death scene.Nevertheless the great Alfred Newman saves the day with his terrific
score. Besides his music capturing all the heat, dust and passion of
the bullring the composer also incorporates into his score the
sumptuous traditional Spanish guitar melody ""Romance D'Amour"". An
engaging and totally ravishing piece that was used to greater effect in
""Forbidden Games"" in 1952 when it was played by guitar genius Narciso
Yepes.BLOOD & SAND can at least be enjoyed for its awesome colour
Cinematography, Newman's great music, the star power and presence of
Tyrone Power and the flowing beauty of Rita Hayworth.",125,1941
1114,10.666666666666666,7.2,"Fifty years ago I was living in the Kenya highlands, only a few miles
from the old Blixen farm. Not a great deal had changed since the 1920s,
the period of the movie, which manages a reasonable re-creation.
However, the background is unlikely to mean much to Americans, only
confirming unreal stereotypes of the colonial British. Meryl Steep, as
we have come to expect, is superb in the part; and in 2003 she
co-narrated a wonderful documentary on the remarkable Karen Blixen
(Isak Dinesen), to whom in fact she bears some physical resemblance.
Robert Redford is badly miscast, and why the producers didn't get one
of many superb English actors for the part I can't imagine. As a love
story well told in what to most people will be an exotic setting,
beautifully photographed, it should be highly rated, justifying its
many awards.",161,1985
1115,6.2,5.4,"This is one of the many sequels that Disney attempted in the new
millennium, which marked the end of the Disney Renaissance era. Some of
them were merely shadows of the original versions and many felt like
someone had taken a straw from the originals, sucked it through and
then vomited them out, leaving behind a total mess.In this case, it's the latter. I can't even begin to count how wrong
this sequel is on so many levels. The plot is riddled with clichés and
is basically the same as the 1967 version, with the original characters
brought back, but with not as much action or development. The new human
characters are overtly annoying, especially the psychopath-in-making
Ranjan, not to mention the father basically echoing the same thing
almost every father in a Disney film says (""I'm very disappointed in
you."" ""I shouldn't have been so hard on you."") If I had a nickel for
every time someone said that, I'd be able to finance my own movie. Another terribly written scene involves Kaa, who, after being
needlessly and brutally abused every time he goes near a man-cub, meets
Shere-Khan again. You would think after everything that happened during
the limited time he was on screen, he would have wanted to rid the
world of man cubs and tell Shere-Khan, who is bent on revenge, where to
find Mowgli. But instead he lies to him, which makes absolutely no
sense. Kaa had no reason whatsoever to lie to him. As I said, the
writers were taking everything from the plot of the first film and put
it into this one, having nothing glue together as it should.The songs are also rubbish and highly forgetful, and John Goodman can't
bring back Baloo to life as Phil Harris did. Goodman is no bear. He's a
Sullivan. Although the animation is much better, it cannot save the fate of how
pointless this sequel is.",72,2003
1116,6.0,7.6,"In case you're wondering, I'm 25 and my favourite films of all time
include Heat, Once Upon a Time in the West and Apocalypse Now. This is
just a pointer to how, considering the film I'm writing about, eclectic
a true film fan's taste has to be. I'll start with one statement: this
film should be compulsory viewing for every child. If, at the end of
this film, you're face is not permanently disfigured from smiling,
there's something wrong with you. Everything about this film is
enjoyable. The characters so loving, the songs so memorable; everything
is so uplifting. I first saw this as a child and right then I loved it,
but not until you reach a certain age do you realise how much a film
can affect you. Every character has something about them that you
cannot fail to love. Baloo and King Louie are obvious - they are there
for light relief, but even the sinister Kaa the snake and Sheer Khan
the tiger are lovable in their own ways. Mainly I put this down to the
voice cast and the way they portray their characters. Everybody with a
good knowledge of film knows that Tom Hanks was the voice of Woody in
Toy Story and that Mike Myers was Shrek, but who knows who provided the
voice of Baloo? It shouldn't matter and, as is the case with The Jungle
Book, it doesn't. The characters are what is important. Character and
plot are the only things that matter in great films and this film has
that theory at its bedrock. If you have a child, sit them down to watch
this and I guarantee they will be transfixed. I'm 25 and I make sure I
watch this every 12 months. Age wise I'm an adult, but I'm still a
child when I see this on screen, and that's the way it should be.",78,1967
1117,12.0,6.5,"A much undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught
in an ever-declining spiral of domestic violence.At times difficult to watch, while Morris Day is portrayed as the
misogynist, Prince as the knight on (motorcycle) steed, he is still
called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay. That he
can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit
to the writing. Prince is so free of ego in this film that not only
does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women,
but his most famous song is fictionalised as being written by his
father and Wendy & Lisa. Even further, two of his compositions -
Computer Blue (admittedly the album's weakest track) and Darling Nikki
- are shown as being songs that kill off an audience. Perhaps the only
concession to the Princely ego is a card that lists the (slightly
shorter than Prince) Apollonia as 5'6.The nearly complete-amateur cast are mainly band members playing
themselves (and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms that
they've never appeared in other movies are completely missing the
point), and do perfectly well under the direction. Morris Day gets most
of the plaudits for his likable ham, though Jerome Benton must also get
credit for bouncing off him well, particularly their stage act, which
is hilarious. Day and Benton even go so far as to make an Abbott and
Costello routine funny, which takes some doing.Lastly, there's Prince. While I admit to bias, I do actually think he's
a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a low-key version
of himself. Acting ISN'T his profession, this was a film made for
entertainment, so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role
isn't Robert DeNiro and thinking they're making a point is sadly
deluded. I don't want this review to be a derisory attack of other
people's comments, but I've even this film slated as having a low
budget and being darkly lit. How would a film about domestic violence
be shot, then? With full overhead spotlights and a CGI dinosaur walking
into frame? The film acts almost as a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny
tie era until you remember that it was actually made in a world of
curly perms and tinny synths, and this isn't some retro-recreation.
Prince's best film with Oscar-winning music, it sees him at his zenith,
and it's saddening to realise that, even though he would make some fine
albums, he would never again capture this high.",111,1984

1119,11.0,4.0,"I've been visiting IMDb.com for over 8 years and this is my first
online review, ever. I'm writing this review because I've seen a lot of
bad movies, and this is not one of them.Maybe it's because of my age (I'm in my 40s), but I disagree with the
negative reviews posted. Funny thing is, I almost skipped over this one
because of the bad reviews -- I'm glad I didn't because this movie
draws you in and, after the first 20 minutes, I was hooked... and you
will be too.In this day and age where it seems all Hollywood can do is either
create movies from comic book heroes OR remake classics, it's hard to
find good movies to watch. Is Submerged the best movie ever made? No.
But, it's definitely way, way better than average.I thought the director used the flashbacks very well in building the
characters and telling the story. The acting was definitely above
average and there is more than enough tension. Mario Van Peebles did a
great job, too. Where the heck has Mario been?? Jonathan Bennett and
Tim Daly also were very good -- the entire cast did well. Finally, the
cinematography, the editing and the music are all top notch. I can't
understand why all the bad reviews. Submerged is a good thriller and
worth your while to watch.I'm not going to give any of the story away but if you are over 30
years old and you're looking for a good thriller to pass the time,
don't pass this one up. It will keep you submerged... until the end.Kudos to the director, the producers, the cast... and everyone
involved.",99,2016

thrilling ending but it just didn't work at all.I don't know what more to say really, it's not a whole lot you can say
about it as it is such a simple movie and it's impossible to talk about
the plot without spoiling it.But the acting was alright (Sarah Bolger will probably go on to do
bigger and better things) and the cinematography was stellar, but yeah
overall it just wasn't a great movie.",80,2015
1122,10.0,5.5,"There's plenty of sex, drugs, nudity, explicit language, and Augmented
Reality fantasies here, but if you're looking for any characters you
can care about you may very well come up empty handed. Shot in
black-and- white, to be fair there is some humor and satire that
emerges every so often, but it never stays on a steady enough path to
sustain itself.Benjamin Dickinson stars here as David, as he also directed the movie
and co-wrote the screenplay with Micah Bloomberg, an advertising exec
who wins the Augmenta account for his agency. They specialize in
Augmented Reality glasses and David volunteers to try out the product
so he can prepare his marketing campaign. However, he begins to find
the trips into Augmented Reality much preferable to his fast crumbling
personal life.All in all, there's a few things to like here but they're outweighed by
pretentious and unlikable characters, so that by the end of the movie I
really didn't care what happened to any of them.",97,2015

1124,9.333333333333334,5.9,"Give me a hell, give me a yeah, hell yeah! Because Blue Mountain State
is back...sort of.While it's not season 4, it's something better: a film adaptation of
the television show. In the past we have seen shows come back as films
with the same talent in front and behind the camera, such as Entourage
(and Sex in the City and Veronica Mars, but I haven't seen their shows
or their movies). But to put it in simple terms, this is a worthwhile
wait to see Moran, Sammie, Thad and the gang back.The story is pretty simple. Alex Moran is entering his senior year at
Blue Mountain State and what seems to be the year in which he'll
control the legendary Goat House. But the new school dean has another
idea: selling the goat house so that the football team will concentrate
on the field. So in order to save the Goat House, Moran will have to
ask the help of an old friend Thad Castle, former BMS football player
and captain as well as the number one draft in the NFL. Thad agrees
that he will buy the Goat House but on one condition: they have to
throw Thad's dream party, including an amusement park known as
Thadland.Pretty easy to see where it's going right? NopeWhat I liked:This movie does what some TV shows turned movies failed to do, be a
good movie. Look, we don't see Blue Mountain State for it's artistic
value or it's compelling drama, we see it for the boobs, drugs, and
alcohol as well as it's hilarious moments.Unlike most movies based on shows, this movie raises the stakes for the
characters and does stuff that you couldn't pull of on Spike. There is
something to lose in the film, the Goat House; something that wasn't in
a film like Entourage. Also, like I said above, this movie is hilarious. I don't want to give
away any specific moments but there are tons of gut-busting scenes in
this movie. There is one sex scene in this movie (out of many) that is
so hilarious, that's worth the price of admission (though it was
released on digital, so worth buying on your computer?).Another great thing about the movie is the cast, everyone is still
hilarious and we get to see some of our old favorites such as Craig
Shilo and Radon Randell. And how can I talk about the cast without
talking about Alan Ritchson as Thad Castle. He's probably the best
thing about this movie. He's hilarious and it reminds you why you loved
the character in the first place. The character of Thad Castle will go
down in history as one of the funniest TV characters, right there with
Stewie Griffin, Sheldon Cooper, and Carlton Banks. Also, this movie is
so unpredictable. If anything, there is only one thing you might expect
but other than that, it is really a wild ride because you are not sure
what the hell is gonna happen at the end.What I disliked:Though there's not a lot to dislike, the main focus of this movie is
Alex Moran and Thad Castle, which is great and all but I would've liked
to see more of the character moments. Most of the cast appearances,
such as those of Harmon, Donnie, Larry, and Mary Jo, are satisfying
appearances. But those of Craig Shilo and Radon Randell are a little
underwhelming, especially Radon because he just seems to show up
without set up and it would've been interesting to see what the two
have been up to since we last saw them. But the biggest of
underwhelming characters is Sammie. Though he has lots of funny
moments, he seems to be demoted to an over-the-top party animal, which
is something that he has was in the show (but in the show had more
character).Also, what prevented Blue Mountain State from being another shitty
American Pie direct- to-video movie was the football aspect of the
show, the moments like when the NCAA is doing a drug test or Thad going
soft on the football field, something that this movie doesn't have and
it's absence is duly noted. The film didn't need a football-centered
plot, but are we really going to get only one scene of them on the
field?Final Verdict:To put it simply, it's hilarious and it's a worthy successor of the
television show. To many it would be seen an awesome party movie, but
it shows the Blue Mountain State has stuff to offer still. This isn't
the ending of the BMS franchise, it's a brand new beginning (at least I
hope), where it can be explored through another season or movie.Also
this movie isn't for those who dislike party movies, but why would you
see it then? Blue Mountain State: The Rise of Thadland reminds me of
why I fell in love with the show in the first place and why I wished my
college was like this. Old fans will love this film, newbies will enjoy
it. For newbies, I'd recommend binge-watching the show on Netflix and
then watch this. Overall Score: B+ (or 7.5/10)",90,2016
1125,9.666666666666666,6.6,"As Nicholas Sparks' film adaptations go, Ross Katz's ""The Choice"" is a
better film than the bland ""Longest Ride"" we got last year and
certainly miles past the perplexing and downright unbelievable ""Safe
Haven"" in 2013. With that being said, it's still burdened by the same
kind of misguided tropes and cloying incredulity that makes each of
these films a chore to sit through. These films come decorated in the
same kind of clothing as the next, as they're built from the ground up
on impossibly romantic circumstances, characters that always look
beautiful no matter what, a truly tragic plot device played up
perfectly to engineer an emotional reaction rather than naturally
warrant one, and a slew of ""perfect moments"" to make your relationship
with your significant other look like a slog. And, specific to this
one, seriously questionable treatment of its female character. Happy
Valentine's Day.This time, we focus on Travis Parker (Benjamin Walker), a veterinarian
working with his father (Tom Wilkinson) at his practice, living in the
small coastal town of Beaufort, North Carolina. Travis lives on his own
and enjoys the peacefulness brought on by cold beer, his beach chair,
and his dog, until his quietness is disrupted by his new neighbor Gabby
Holland (Teresa Palmer). Gabby is a med student, who is currently
dating a fellow doctor, but her playfully stubborn aura makes her all
the more attractive to Travis.When her boyfriend leaves for a medical retreat for several weeks, the
two succumb to intense emotional desires, have sex, and begin to that
thing that so many young people do nowadays where they act like they're
dating to others, have sex and sleep together like they are, but really
aren't together. When her boyfriend gets back, Gabby immediately wants
things to go back to the way things were before he left, leaving Travis
out to dry, and making them both look like immature, stupid people who
can't appropriately handle or discuss their own baggage. Nonetheless,
Gabby winds up breaking up with him and her and Travis wind up getting
married and starting a family of their own.This may sound like I just went through the entire film's plot, but
that wouldn't make sense since I never addressed the core ""choice"" this
film and its two lead characters love to talk about through narration.
Well, ""the choice"" comes towards the end, when a catastrophic accident
occurs and leaves one of the parties with a big decision. However, Katz
(who directed ""Adult Beginners"" two years ago) and screenwriter Bryan
Sipe rush through this whole circumstance at the end like it's a big
afterthought. The fundamental ""choice"" of the film isn't introduced
until far too late in the picture, where it can't develop, and as a
result, feels like a tacked on conclusion.""The Choice"" is a tad more forgivable than many other Sparks-branded
pictures because at least one of our leads has an ounce of personality
this time around. Benjamin Walker's, who already looks and talks like a
young Colin Firth, Travis is a very snarky character throughout the
picture, which at least makes him an interesting personality rather
than a plastic presence. Teresa Palmer's Gabby is a blander, more
ordinary female lead, but her ability to handle the more dramatic
scenes with competence makes up for her lack of character development.I think the most problematic thing about ""The Choice"" as a whole is the
strange way it tries to pass off unromantic instance as romantic, and,
if we're going to be completely critical of the film's ideology here,
almost makes a case for ""no means yes"" misogyny that has plagued women
for decades. Consider the scene when Travis drives all the way out to
Gabby's parents' home, where she is staying for the weekend, to ask her
parents for her hand in marriage. Gabby is clearly horrified by this
entire circumstance, yet her mother and father are in awe of Travis's
conviction of wanting to marry her. Though she repeatedly says ""no"" a
good dozen times, her mother and father keep insisting that this is
what's best for her, going as far to say this is what she wants, and
even encourage Travis by giving him a ring with which to propose. The
next scene, they're happily married in a church. What a strange,
uncomfortable scene that illustrates the least romantic circumstance
that basically tells Gabby's character, ""stop resisting, smile, and
accept the ring, you ingrate."" Getting all riled up about the gender relations in the latest Nicholas
Sparks' film is a losing battle in and of itself because these films
are so contrived and detrimental not only to men and women but romantic
expectations in general that pervasive analysis only warrants a
headache. This is another loser in the long line of these mediocre,
incredulous films that perpetuate false ideas of romance with the same
narrative structure and emotional manipulation so much so that the
white flag I've been waving at these films for the last few years, in
utter defeat and contempt, has long been discolored.",111,2016

this film. English is not my native language, so forgive any of my
mistakes, only if you wish to do so.Secondly, I'm not a Mormon, I'mo not a fanatic of religion, not even a
so called Hellas citizen, but as Socrates says (yes,says,not ""said""), I
am a citizen of this world.The film is truly excellent, one of it's kind, strong enough to carry
each one of us deep into the most simple truth in life..difference is
only to the outside. Cause inside of us, each person carries the unity
not only of human kind, but the unity of universe itself, the unity of
the whole universe into one soul mind and body..and this beats
everything.As Socrates one day said, while going to a spring to drink water with
his cup, that this child beat me in simplicity, when seeing a child by
drinking with his own hands from the spring. Then he dropped the cup
away, so that he could act the same as the child did.So, I'm admitting the same. This film beats me in simplicity, by being
witness of their strength, by their pure wisdom, by their effort to
help each other in every and each possible way, seeing each other's
weaknesses, not to criticize them, but wanting to change them to their
best possible strength again, finding themselves in this world
throughout their pure good will intentions..throughout unity.Eventually, the human spirit and the governments of this world, could
have learn enough if not all, from the very best example of.. at least

flick, lots of shootouts, occasional torture, many catfights and naked
breasts. The acting in this movie differs. Pam Grier is great as
always, and so is sexy Margaret Markov as Karen. Sid Haig's performance
as Ruben, a slightly insane gangster in a cowboy outfit, is another
highlight in ""Black Mama, White Mama"" and makes the movie a lot
funnier. The rest of the acting is nothing special, typical B-movie
performances, some better some worse. A fan of Pam Grier and lover of
blaxploitation classics like ""Coffy"" as well as films like ""Jackie
Brown"", I found ""Black Mama, White Mama"" very entertaining. Not one of
Pam Grier's best movies, but better than most 'Women's prison' flicks,
this is a violent and fun film and definitely worth watching.",87,1973
1130,7.375,7.5,"I remember this Peanuts movie-special, along with A Boy Named Charlie
Brown, fondly as a kid, when they replayed these specials on
Nickelodeon (or it might have been Disney's channel, can't remember
which). Each one had several songs in each pot, all of them catchy to
one degree or another, and featuring some of the genuine wit of the
comic strips. This film is maybe relying on more sentimentality than
the former, as in this one the issue of leaving home and belonging to
an master/owner (and the attachment), and the comedy isn't as rampant
as in other Peanuts specials. But of the dozens of Peanuts specials-
and the short-lived television series- this is one of the better ones,
as there are some moments that still stick in my mind many years after
seeing it. One of these is the classic ""No Dog's Allowed"" song, with
the perfect bass sounding voice. And the whole sequence where Snoopy is
under protest taken in by a very determined little girl is brilliantly
done for laughs. For some kids, depending on if they're attached to the
Peanuts or not, may feel stronger with this film, with the very
conflicting climax with Snoopy and his masters. There's enough fun
though, as Woodstock's first appearance in the Peanuts series is well
placed and delivered, with as many vaudevillian expressions as Snoopy.Just good, family fun for all.",81,1972
1131,12.5,8.3,"The Big Parade is one of those films that left profound impact on me after
single viewing. This focus on John Gilbert's character, Jim, whose
experienced a major changes in his life, which has dire consquences and good
results. It is easy why John Gilbert became superstar after this film
because he's terrific actor, whose can commanded such a expression with his
face. It is very seldom to see the actor like that one. Karl Dane did great
job by providing comedy relief as Slim. Tom O'Brien did really fantastic job
as Bull, a bartender, who keep in balance with John Gilbert.I cannot think of single film that is perfect translated in 3 acts and The
Big Parade is great example of that one. The 3 acts in The Big Parade
represented significant changes in Gilbert's life. Some may disliked comedy
relief but that was intend for making us caring more for the characters,
which works for me. Many films are lucky to have one great sequence. The Big Parade are being
linked by series of magnificent sequences, which is rarity. Renee Adoree did
great job by portraying Melisande, the French girl who had fell in love with
Gilbert. Look for that moment between them when Gilbert had to leave for
mission. Such a heartbreaking moment in cinema history. I was very sad at
that moment. Gilbert, had Academy Awards existed, would have probably won an Academy
Award for best actor because it's one of the great performance I've ever
seen. King Vidor did really great job directing this outstanding film. It is
very seldom that silent cinema can move me as much as sounds does. I hope I
can watch it again in future because it's truly fantastic film in its own
rights. ****/****",140,1925
1132,9.4,7.2,"For the first 102 minutes, I saw this film much as MATTHEWSCOTT8: a
pleasant movie that was charming and colorful, but otherwise ordinary.
The final minute, however, is transcendent and elevates the entire work
to something else. (The only other example of this I can think of is
John Huston's ""The Dead"" where the final voice over forces you to
reevaluate everything that have come before in a new light).Here is one interpretation of the the events of the last minute and
their meaning:A player steps to the edge of the stage, beyond the
curtain. He reveals the cosmological structure of this play within a
play within a film. The first play is the ""real world"" where ordinary
events occur and characters interact. Most pursue some narrow selfish
objective, but on rare occasions one overcomes their greed and achieves
a degree of liberation and fulfillment (in this case Camilla).The second play is the stage on which the our narrator stands; a kind
of Bardo between the fist play and our audience. The audience is a sea
of human souls - all those who have passed away as their personal play
has ended.The narrator tells us that Camilla is missing. In the background we see
her pale ghostly image as she bids farewell to remaining cast members.The narrator then gives us his philosophy of life, ""Don't waste your
time on the so called real life. You belong to us""..."" the only way to
find happiness is on any stage""... ""during those two little hours when
you become another person; your true self."" Thus, even a fairly
standard story offers the potential to transcend our plight and
experience something eternal. Renoir is describing the essence of pure
eastern mysticism, here in a deeply western European context.""Filipe, Ramon and the Viscount have disappeared. Gone."" says Camilla,
""Don't they exist anymore?"".""Now they are part of the audience. Do you miss them ?"" asks our
narrator.Overall, this ending is so quick and unexpected that is feels like a
rabbit punch to awaken the spirit. We are left, like Camilla, to
contemplate the play, the nature of all plays and our own existence.",103,1952
1133,7.0,7.2,"I was fortunate enough to be an extra in this movie when I was about 13
during the roller rink scenes. My junior high school drama class was
invited to participate. It was a fantastic experience.Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played the music live,
all day! As a musician, I can appreciate the tireless work and
dedication these guys put in to their roles. They must have played
those songs 20 times. It's very difficult to maintain consistency and
energy under those conditions. This is visible during a cut to a
close-up on ""That'll Be the Day,"" but fortunately the unsuspecting
public probably wouldn't have picked it up.Skating around all day, getting the day off from school and being
transported back in time was a incredible thrill. I also had my first
""date"" on film. I had to walk a girl up to the ticket booth. Woo hoo!
Even with an out-of-date haircut and hot lights melting the vaseline in
my hair, it was still worth it. Fun stuff.The movie is top notch and is highly satisfying as a whole. Busey
delivers his best role ever and the supporting cast is superb. I'm glad
to have participated in a great film of the day. To think I could have
been in Corvette Summer or something. Not.A funny ironic ending to this is that years later I was in a video
store in Malibu looking at the movie the week it was released on video.
Gary Busey walked in and stood right next to me. I showed him the cover
and babbled on how great he was and how I was an extra and whatnot.

1134,7.8,7.6,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut
to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it
at Amazon.)This movie really made me think about sexual differences and what it
means to have a sex change or to want one, or to be trapped in a gender
you don't want. It was very effective to have us see Hilary Swank (who
plays Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon) with short hair and male facial
expressions and gestures without giving us a glimpse of her as Teena.
(Actually we did get a brief glimpse in a photo.) Swank looks like a
boy, acts like a boy, in fact works hard to be a boy; indeed that is
(sadly) part of what this movie is about, what it means to be a boy in
middle America as opposed to being a girl. And then when we have the
scene with the tampons and the breast wrapping and we see her legs, the
effect is startling, an effect possibly lost on those who knew that the
person playing Brandon was a woman. It was when I saw her legs and
could tell at a glance that she was a woman with a woman's legs that I
realized just how subtle, but unmistakable are the anatomical sexual
differences, and how convincing Swank's portrayal was.I was reminded as I watched this of being a young person, of being a
teenager and going through all the rituals and rites, unspoken,
unplanned, without social sanction, that we all go through to prove our
identity, because that is what Brandon was so eager to do, to prove his
identity as a boy. I thought, ah such an advantage he has with the
girls because he knows what they like and what they want. He can be
smooth, and how pretty he looks. It was strange. I actually knew some
guys in my youth who had such talent, and the girls did love them.The direction by Kimberly Peirce is nicely paced and the forebodings of
horror to come are sprinkled lightly throughout so that we don't really
think about the resolution perhaps until the campfire scene in which
John Lotter shows his self-inflicted scars and tosses the knife to
Brandon. Then we know for sure, something bad is going to happen.Hilary Swank is very convincing. Her performance is stunning, and she
deserved the Academy Award she won for Best Actress. She is the type of
tomboy/girl so beloved of the French cinema, tomboyish, but obvious a
girl like, for example, Zouzou as seen in Chloe in the Afternoon (1972)
or Élodie Bouchez in the The Dreamlife of Angels (1998), or many
others. Indeed, one is even reminded of Juliette Binoche, who of course
can play anything, or going way back, Leslie Caron in Gigi (1958).
Chloe Signvey, who plays Lana Tisdel, the girl Brandon loves, whom I
first saw in Palmetto (1998), where she stole a scene or two from Woody
Allen and Elisabeth Shue, really comes off ironically as butch to
Swank, yet manages a sexy, blue collar girl next door femininity. She
also does a great job. Peter Sarsgaard is perfect as John Lotter,
trailer trash car thief and homophobic redneck degenerate.Very disturbing is the ending. If you know the story, you know the
ending. Just how true this was to the real life story it is based on is
really irrelevant. I knew nothing about the story, but I know that film
makers always take license to tell it the way they think it will play
best, and so it's best to just experience the film as the film,
independent of the real story, which, like all real stories, can never
be totally told.Obviously this is not for the kiddies and comes as close to an ""X""
rating as any ""R"" movie you'll ever see. It will make most viewers
uncomfortable, but it is the kind of story that needs to be told.",118,1999

single move is surprising and any idea that was really too much was
happily included in the movie. You'll be smiling from the beginning to

1137,14.0,6.5,"Luciano Ercoli's Death Walks on High Heels is a sexy and suspenseful
thriller. The convoluted plot revolves around the whereabouts of some
stolen jewels and the involvement of a strip tease girl.Susan Scott (aka Nieves Navarro) plays the stripper who is central to
the story. And, quite frankly, she's a revelation. Oozing sex appeal
and stealing every scene she appears in, Miss Scott was one of the
queens of giallo cinema. She was highly impressive in Forbidden Photos
of a Lady Above Suspicion but she is given a more central role here.
And she delivers one of the most erotic performances in the giallo
sub-genre.Other than the obvious appeal of the delicious leading lady, Ercoli's
movie works as a suspenseful thriller, with some genuinely unsettling
scenes. Chief amongst them being the somewhat haunting appearance of
the 'high heels' killer in the opticians, whose approach is seen
through through frosted glass and, also of note is an extremely brutal
murder scene in the latter half of the movie, the savagery of it is
definitely shocking. This murder stands out all the more as this is not
exactly a body-count movie. The violence is kept to a minimum but is
strong when it rears it's head.Like in Forbidden Photos, Ercoli uses another actress who looks
strikingly similar to Susan Scott, in this case Claudie Lange. Simón
Andreu, another Ercoli regular, puts in another sleazy performance as
the chief suspect. And there is a host of other shady characters
prowling about. In fact there are so many red herrings that we even
have a dodgy character selling fish! In order for early 70's gialli to
sell themselves to an international market they were often expected to
do two things. Firstly cast leading ladies who look more Anglo-Saxon
than Italian (which the Spanish but strawberry haired Miss Scott
fulfilled) and secondly to incorporate locations outwith Italy (this
being achieved by the French and British settings).Death Walks on High Heels is one of the most erotically charged gialli
I've seen. Recommended for fans of both Italian thrillers and, of
course, Susan Scott.",0,1971

Joy Mangano a business woman and inventor of home products.As I'm reading this is far from the actual life of Mangano (who, unlike
the Joy in the movie, she went to University and has a degree in
business administration). It is more like a blend of the stories of
other housewives turned to businesswomen (if you can believe that) and
contains lots of fictional elements for dramatic purposes.Nevertheless the plot is weak. So is the script. There isn't any actual
moral here (like ""Try and you will succeed""), and the narration of her
grandmother dilutes any of that ""moral"" with too much ""it is your
destiny"" crap.Soooo, the movie is an empty shell (or should I say Sell, pun intended)
but is it fun to watch? No. Not really.The characters (including Robert De Niro's who plays her father,
Elisabeth Röhm's who plays her half-sister, Virginia Madsen's who plays
her mother and Isabella Rossellini's who plays her father's girlfriend
and serves as the initial investor) are heavily unsympathetic.The direction is blunt, the pace uneven (I wont spoil you but the
resolution of all problems comes in just a few seconds near the end),
the situations unbelievable (like going to the...bathroom and unveil a
conspiracy by pure luck) etc.Overall: A blunt movie with weak script and plot. The unsympathetic
characters also make this unbearable. Not fun to watch and no true

flick. But I liked it because it had a great story and the acting was
sublime as did the effects used for the zombies and the way they
narrated this flick.North and South are at the end of the war but in one of the final
battles suddenly some soldiers appear with an unusual look, zombies.
From there on we see how Edward Young (Mark Gibson) survives and sees
that the world has been overtaken by the walking dead. His wife and son
are bitten, his son is out there as a walker, and he just got one goal,
to find his son. From there on the zombies are second in the story and
Edward Young becomes the main lead. We follow him by narrating (Brian
Cox) and even in cartoon style. The way it was filmed and the way John Geddes (director) directed it
was really a relieve to see. It clocks in at 108 minutes and it never
bored me. And just when you thought, what's next suddenly it changes
completely. But what a great performance by Mark Gibson. His first big lead and
only his second feature, One to watch. Also nice to see was Dee Wallace
as Eve and Bill Moseley as General Williams. I even didn't recognize
Dee here as the so-called witch. Finally, Bill is back on the track
after 2001 Maniacs:Fields Of Scream also as a soldier (mayor in fact).
A small part for Stephen McHattie who did a great job a while ago in
Pontypool (2008). Here he is again great with his typical face.Yes you noticed it, I can't say anything bad about this 'zombie' flick

really anything gory here to see but still the zombies looked really
great. If you liked I Am Legend (2007) or The Road (2009) or Stake land

this one over and over again. I was surprised that so many others didn't
care for it. I just loved the sets, the costumes, the women and their
relationships, the real magic in the film, the special effects, the child
actresses. This was stuff that women could relate to better than men.
Aidan Quinn was the only boring part of the movie. I wished they'd chosen
an actor who was more into the role. He seemed bored and made his part in
the film more boring. (Also, he mumbles. Someone should give him elocution
lessons.)This movie wasn't meant to be heavy. It was meant to be light, fun fluff,
and that it is. The characters weren't meant to be deep, but I felt the
relationship between the two sisters was deeper and well performed by two
skilled actresses. In spite of the fluffiness of it, I enjoyed the two
scenes in which we got to sit and relax to the sound of Stevie Nicks'
""Crystal."" So what if cars weren't crashing and guns weren't shooting.
They weren't supposed to be. I felt the camaraderie of the moment as the
two sisters and their aunts got drunk on ""midnight margaritas"" while dancing
to Harry Nilsson's ""Lime in the Coconut."" It was just plain light fun.
Also, women can enjoy the vicarious satisfaction of watching these women
destroy the evil, bullying man who tries to destroy them. The end of the film was rather Disney-kiddie-flick-like. Another ending
might have worked better, but it was tolerable because it reminded the
audience that the film was all in fun, and not to be taken
seriously.I usually prefer deeper films, but I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of fluff.
Sure it was silly and campy, but it was fun. A film doesn't have to take
itself seriously to be fun. Bullock, Kidman, Channing, and Wiest are

watching the four of them over and over again.",104,1998

It's a very good movie, in my opinion second best of Paul Schrader's films,
right after ""Mishima - Life in four chapters"", and I never understood why it

I've ever seen, with fascinating scenes from start to finish, vibrant colors
and beautiful sets and exterior shots. Paul Schrader, apart from being a
great scriptwriter is also the master of photography, maybe the best in
modern Hollywood. American Gigolo is a phenomenal character study too,
struggle of a lonely man against the society he doesn't belong to, and in
which he was artificially implanted by becoming something he's not. Michelle
(Lauren Hutton) succeeds in bringing out the true Julian Kay, and their
relationship on screen is very close and direct, although it maybe doesn't
seem so, probably because both of the actors appear cold and distant, but
that's just the result of the world they're living in. Both their lives are
fake, and the only time they are real is with one another. The love scene
between Julian and Michelle is one of the best in history of the cinema, it

by the usual garbled sound problems! It is also an example of a
maligned Vincent Price film (Leonard Maltin says he ""walks through it
in a daze""!) which is actually not too bad. That said, the actor was
not well served by ""Euro-Cult"" (this is a Spanish-German production,
despite the British involvement of the writer-producer and director),
as can also be gleaned from his sole Mario Bava collaboration DR.
GOLDFOOT AND THE GIRL BOMBS (1966)! Price and co-star Martha Hyer are a couple engaged in a magic act
(called Manderville, so that he is later mockingly dubbed ""Mandrake""!)
who are involved in the trafficking of women for the purposes of
prostitution (they purposefully choose lonely girls to make them
disappear both on stage and in real life but, of course, they are bound
to slip sometime...because otherwise there would be no film!).
Considering the subject matter and Towers' resume', this is remarkably
chaste; in any case, the very first victim we see here (being
transported in a coffin!) is none other than Maria Rohm aka Mrs.
Towers. Her boyfriend sets on her trail, which leads him to Tangier,
where he seeks the help of criminal pathologist George Nader (the hero
inevitably played by an ageing Hollywood presence). Hindering their
progress is local photographer Herbert Fux, while the proper Police
investigation is carried out by Wolfgang Kieling (who had just been a
villain, served with a memorable death scene, in Alfred Hitchcock's
TORN CURTAIN {1966}).Typically, the identity of the organization's head is a mystery to all;
hence, the ultimate revelation proves quite a surprise...and, though it
then transpires that Price was not as villainous as had been inferred,
he still gets a melodramatic demise. By the way, I was surprised to
notice the Maltese name of Charles Camilleri as the film's composer;

stakes of the film. Few British people would NOT know this, given that
their abdicated king Edward and his wife Wallis Simpson openly admired
Hitler, and many other high-borns found him quite right to attack
democracy in its heart.Romula Garai, one of the world's finest new actresses, carries the
movie with her endless shading of emotions, her eyes opening to the
horror that her family really is despite its large, warm embrace of

1149,15.0,7.7,"One of things that I think attracts young film fans to German cinema
from the Weimar period is that it displays a striking stylistic
extremism that captivates modern viewers not yet used to silent cinema.
This ranges from Murnau's technical effects extravaganzas, to
Lubitsch's off-the-wall comedy creations and, of course, Fritz Lang's
angular architecture and comic-book sense of adventure.A mistaken impression with these pictures is that they got to be so
stylised because of a higher degree of artistic freedom in the European
studios. However UFA studios were just as much about collaboration and
commercialism as those in Hollywood. While individual directors did
have a lot of control over the look of their pictures, these overt
styles owe more to the influence of German theatre, as well as German
literature, painting and the opera.As with any cinema, anywhere, one of the most important collaborators
is the screenwriter. No matter how strong or attention-grabbing your
visual style is, if you haven't got the story, you haven't got
anything. Spione features one of the best efforts from Lang's
collaborator and wife Thea von Harbou, and is in many ways a
tightened-up reworking of Dr Mabuse. Whereas that earlier picture was
full of unnecessarily long title cards, Spione is far more succinct,
allowing the audience to fill in the gaps. Importantly it begins with a
lengthy piece of pure silent storytelling, which helps to engage us
before bombarding us with verbal information. Harbou's characters are
also very strong. It's a nice touch to make arch-villain Haghi
wheelchair bound  a man who is weak in body but strong in means and
influence.Lang himself was by now a master of his own highly individual
technique. Space and set décor should be important to every director,
but Lang is probably the only one who tells his stories more through
architecture than through actors. With rooms so bizarre and angular
they would probably drive most people mad if they had to live or work
in them, Lang sets a tone for each location, and thus for each scene.
Narrow corridors give a sense of entrapment; open doorways leading onto
larger spaces give a sense of uneasiness; crisscrossing diagonals carve
up the screen, often drawing our attention to things and people. One
thing that especially stands out in Spione is that way Lang often
creates compositions that are almost-but-not-quite symmetrical. Just as
a great colour director like Vincente Minnelli might throw in a splash
of blue to offset (and thus bring to life) a shot full of shades of
red, Lang adds for example the nurse standing to one side of an
otherwise symmetrical shot of Haghi sat at his desk.Even Lang's choice of camera position was strictly angular. He is
either to one side, detached from the action, or he is right inside it
with actors staring straight into the lens. He rarely uses, say,
opposing over-the-shoulder shots that many directors would for intimate
dialogue scenes, but his methods were nonetheless effective. Spione in
fact features one of his most beautifully constructed romantic scenes
in the first meeting between Willy Fritsch and Gerda Maurus. Lang
begins with the camera to one side, simply filming the meeting as a
casual observer. He then begins placing the camera between them,
interspersed with close-ups of hands or other objects, making us
experience the growing emotional intensity as well as that slight
feeling of awkwardness. We then return to a shot to the side of the
actors, but closer this time, as they move in for their first kiss. In
spite of his reputation Lang could be incredibly tender and sentimental
at times.Exaggerated acting tends to be part and parcel of that over-the-top
nature of German silent cinema, and in the case of Lang's features it
is often particularly apt given the comic-book style characters and
situations. Spione is no exception, but it is nice to see the normally
animated Rudolf Klein-Rogge getting to underplay it a little as a cool
and collected villain. Lupu Pick also gives a very deep and emotionally
complex performance as the Japanese ambassador.The upshot of this collaboration is an incredibly exciting and
satisfying picture, even though it is rarely referenced as one of Fritz
Lang's best. If it is remembered at all it is usually for its
resemblance to later gadget-based espionage thrillers, as well as
containing many of the suspense building techniques later employed by
Hitchcock, such as letting the audience in on things the characters do
not know. It is, nevertheless, among the most carefully constructed,
exciting and purely enjoyable of Lang's silent pictures, and an
improvement on the better-known Dr Mabuse.",0,1928

has
some political overtones. Everyone knows about the Eastwood/Leone movies

this is just the tip of the iceberg, there were hundreds of spaghetti
westerns made & this is one of the best. Through a combination of illness

Solomon Beauregard Bennet. Gradually the two men begin to influence each
other - for better & for worse - with the teacher becoming more vicious
an
outlaw than Solomon ever was. Solomon on the other hand begins to see
another way of life & the folly of his criminal past.The transformation
between the two characters is really interesting & believable, this

with some great western scenes, a score by Ennio Morricone, some familiar
spaghetti western actors (including the excellent Tomas Milian) & an
explosive finale make this a western to rival anything that the more well

again
without getting bored. That's not to say it's the best, no no no, but
there's something about this movie which I just can't get enough of. It's
easily the most frequently used tape in my limited video
library.Mainly it's the cast; quality names down the length of the list, and each
one, from Robert Redford heading the motley crew of good guys (Dan Ackroyd
and Sidney Poitier especially good) to Ben Kingsley as a deliciously cool
but insecure villain. They're all clearly having such a good time as
they're
making the movie that you can't help but join them; it's infectious.It's also surprisingly timeless. Seven years have passed since this movie
came out, which is a long time in the gadget world in which this film is
based, but none of their equipment or techniques (except a brief glimpse
of
a now outdated version of Windows but that's REALLY nitpicking) seem out
of
date; it could still be today.And then there's the moments. This is a film based on a whole load of
brilliantly memorable moments. When they find out what the mysterious
black
box actually does, it's truly chilling. All the little tricks of their
trade
on display are each a delight, from setting off fire alarms to being on
the
other end of the phone when the fire service is subsequently called. And
the

conclusions ever captured on film.In case you hadn't noticed, I love this movie. A great score, a great
cast,
and a whole lot of fun. Whether you got to these comments because you want
to know if this film was worth seeing, or whether a training shoe
web-search
somehow ended you up here against your will, you really should see this
film. It's a hugely entertaining piece of the nineties. And Robert Redford
has done nothing better since.",126,1992
1152,7.5,7.0,"I've just watched this obscure little British horror. The only name I
recognised in the credits was the writer Richard Matheson. But it turns out
that the director was Sidney Hayers, who also directed Circus of Horrors,
before he went on to direct a lot of television, including The A Team, The
New Avengers and Manimal (does anyone remember that?).The plot is a little haywire, but this is a great film. It fits into the
horror sub-genre ""Housewives and school teachers who get into witchcraft"",
along with Horror Hotel, Hammer's The Witches, Romero's Season of the Witch
and many others, probably. It's got some great visuals, partly due to the
very dark black and white photography, it has genuine moments of suspense
and the special effects are incredible for a film of its age and low budget.
It's also known as Burn, Witch, Burn, which gives it a sensationalist twist
that it doesn't really need. Night of the Eagle is a much more appropriate
title. I highly recommend this if you can catch it on TV or
DVD!",90,1962
1153,4.5,4.8,"I cannot stress the fact that this film has been overplayed and
recycled through Hollywood more times that I can count. While I have
read some reviews that claim that this is one of Lawrence's more
creative roles yet, I can only laugh and gag simultaneously at these
words. Lawrence was a major contributor to the downfall of this film.
He provided no character analysis, no development, and definitely no
humor to the entire story. It was as if we were watching a dress
rehearsal in progress before the final script arrived with all of
Lawrence's funny bits. From the quick introduction at the beginning of
the film (a mere 7 minutes of character introduction), until the
incoherent ending that was trying to monopolize on the popularity of
Gladiator, we never see Lawrence's character of ""Jamal"" or ""Skywalker""
(depending on the care of the actors) emerge from the film. This was
merely Martin Lawrence cashing in on his already overplayed self,
stretching no further than his comfortable limits and never exerting
anything ""fresh"". He has fallen into the cracks of the Hollywood
recycling bin and Black Knight reinforces that idea.Sadly, Lawrence isn't backed up with any better acting or story. Tom
Wilkinson has done some amazing films during his career, but apparently
was looking to buy a new car with this film. It required no ""real""
acting from him, just sloppy drunkenness with clichéd moments near the
end that could have been pulled from any other film like this one. I
think that was my major problem with this film (beside the lackluster
Lawrence) was the story. There wasn't any. It felt like we were forced
from the beginning to all of our different places and events just to
fill time. There wasn't any redeeming value from the story. In fact, I
would go so far as to say that whomever wrote this screenplay may
havegaspplagiarized from nearly every other film like this one out
there. The structure was nothing new, the formula literally had dust on
it, and nobody seemed to care. Lawrence obviously didn't from the
performance that he gave, but I expected more from Mr. Wilkinson who
has impressed me in the past. This was not the best showcase for his
talent, or for anyone's talent to say the least. We must always
remember that it begins with a story, and if it doesn't sound good on
paper than it isn't going to translate well onto the screen. This is a
rule to live by for everyone involved with the Black Knight debacle.Finally, I normally don't mention this in my reviews, but with this
film it just stood out more than any other that I have seen, but the
production of this film was horrible. The costumes, the sets, and even
the way the shots were framed seemed ""cheap"" in so many ways. The
costumes are the first that come to mind because Lawrence always seemed
like he was wearing something that was made with haste. How could he
have quickly made this garment in the time that he was in this land?
Who knows, but it was ""cheap"" and only lowered this film further into
the muck pit. If the story is going to be bad, and the actors are not
going to give their full potential by actually doing what they are paid
 to be creative  than at least give us something to look at
Production Team! Unfortunately, there was nothing ravishing to even
glance at. The entire Medieval World that Lawrence works at from the
beginning is ""cheap"" and obviously a set. I want a film to take me away
from Hollywood and give me my dollar's worth, not rob me blind. The
cinematography was done by a two-year old. Nothing spectacular, nothing
worth writing about.Overall, this was a very poor film. Would it have hurt anyone working
on this project to use a little something I like to call ""imagination""?
Creativity was not being used or welcomed in this film. You could tell
that the director wanted to make the film, edit out what didn't work,
finish, and relax at home while thinking of all the different ways that
he could spend his Hollywood money! I blame two major players in this
film for the overall poor quality. The first is Mr. Lawrence. If he
does not expand his acting potential and bring something new to the
screen, I don't think his Hollywood stay will be very long. The second
player that I blame for this befuddling mess is the writer. Again,
creativity and imagination went backseat to the infamous Hollywood
recycling bin. This was a truly disappointing picture.Grade: * out of *****",95,2001
1154,9.75,6.5,"Guess the film from the following description of its characters. A
young man investigating misdeeds in the police force, motivated by the
memory of his father (a legendary policeman) but also by the pain of
having lost the affections of a woman he loves to another player in the
drama. A renegade cop, rampaging violently through the city, but
revered on the force for standing up to the scum on the streets. And
the renegade's boss, who protects him, partly because he himself is on
old-school Irish policeman; but partly because he appreciates having
his own private bag-man, especially in his dealings with organised
crime. Throw in some prostitutes for a little background colour, and it
sounds like a perfect description of 'L.A. Confidential'. But it also
describes this tough and underrated movie made by Sidney Lumet some
years before Curtis Hanson's film.Whereas Hanson's film was stylised, and glamorised violence (provided
the cause was just), Lumet has gone for a more realist approach, and
his bad cop (played mesmerisingly by Nick Nolte) is completely rotten,
in fact resembling Harvey Kietel's 'Bad Liutennant' in Abel Fererra's
movie. The film is dated by its ghastly electronic soundtrack, and more
interestingly by its portrait of New York at a time when the city was
at its lowest ebb. But it's a very well assembled thriller, exploring
issues of race, mixed loyalties and the meaning of good policing
without flinching from a grim picture of life on the margins of law
abiding society. Lumet has had a long career, but this is one of his
better films, and ultimately more truthful than Hanson's stylish
charade. Each are good, in their own way: why is only one so
appreciated?",132,1990
1155,6.833333333333333,0.0,"First, let's start by reminding people that Wizart is a NEW animation
studio that started up in 2011. As far as animations studios go, this
is a very young studio. With that said, however, that also means that
trying to compare them to weathered studios like Disney/Pixar and
Dreamworks isn't exactly a fair assessment.So, let's focus on what really matters:Story: The Snow Queen 2 opens by skimming sequences of the first movie,
but then quickly points out that this film is just as much attached to
the events of the first, but also striving to be it's own thing...
which it does quite well. Your Main Character, Orm is a complex character filled with emotion
that he buries deep inside of him. Add in a sarcastic-humor and you get
a pretty entertaining character. Mixed in with a number of other
colorful personalities (many are stereotypes) you enter a world that is
not meant to be thought to hard on, rather enjoyed for what it is.If I must state that the highlight of this film isn't Orm so much as it
is his grandma, who happens to have quite a character for an old
lady... I enjoyed every moment that she was on screen.The downside of the film was in the return of several of the main
characters from the first film, almost as a crutch to the film. Their
cameo (as it were) almost felt out of place and the action that
revolved around them did distract from the characters that you DID want
to pay attention to... but to be fair even their animation was a major
improvement over the first Snow Queen film.As far as the message of the film, I really have to say I loved it.
It's a pretty clear message that any child could understand: Lying.
Lying not only can hurt people, but it can tie you up into a
sophisticated web that you find difficult to release yourself from. Add
in the bonus message of forgiveness, and this film in many ways was
better than your average Pixar/Disney film for that reason alone.The music.... pretty average... not bad, however, not something I could
hum out of a theater.Animation quality: Still not talking about a perfect A+ animation,
however, that didn't seem to be the negative of this film. For some
reason, the film's loose animation style helps drive itself away from
being mistaken from a Disney/Pixar film... for a person like myself,
that's actually a good thing.Wizart has so much to offer, and I'm sure that they're only going to
keep getting better as time allows. I am genuinely impressed with their
progress.If you haven't seen this film, check it out. I highly recommend it.",0,2014

section) of James Michener's famous book, ""Hawaii"" is actually a rather
intimate, incredibly tragic story despite its claim to ""epic"" scale. The
performances are excellent, especially Max von Sydow as Abner, the stubborn,
unyielding missionary. Special mention has to be made of Jocelyne LaGarde
as Queen Malama. A woman who never acted before, Jocelyne gives a wonderful
performance and will forever remain in your mind as the symbol of Hawaiian
heart and warmth. The talent behind the camera is considerable: George Roy
Hill as director, Russell Metty as cinematographer, and Elmer Bernstein as
composer. (I do sometimes wonder if this film was planned to be a Cinerama

designed with that in mind.) Despite the length and the epic intentions,
prepare yourself for an intimate film with an emotional impact not found in
many films.",189,1966

joy--she gives one of her best performances and even sings ""I Will

falls short in terms of an overall fluidity. Maybe it's because it's

1160,9.75,6.4,"A reporter, Jonathan Fisher(Christopher Reeve) who creates a story
about a pimp to get himself out of a rut and into the prestige of the
New Yorker magazine, becomes a hot commodity, and finds himself in hot
water as a Harvard district attorney believes he has personal inside
information on a real pimp being prepared for trial over a heinous
murder(he kicked someone's face in). Fisher becomes immersed(more like
embroiled, for lack of a better term) in the nightmarish world of Fast
Black's life, discovering first hand his violent temper and short fuse
for anyone(including/especially his working girls)who crosses him the
wrong way. Fisher's involvement with Fast Black is the heart of this
movie, what he endures for a fabrication and how his life evolves into
a tumultuous state of affairs. Fast Black wants Fisher to cook up
another story about how they were together when the murder took place.
Threats from Fast Money are serious business and when Fisher says he
will not comply with his demands, danger awaits the reporter..his
career rises as he hits the streets exposing corruption and the city's
welfare/plight.How a work of fiction, pinned out of desperation, can send a reporter
into the doldrums is the film's emotional arc and as is seeing how
Fisher climbs himself out of the bleakest of situations, not to mention
his getting even for the stabbing of his girlfriend Alison(Mimi
Rogers). Boy, does the plot sure put Fisher in a bind..that, to me, is
part of what makes Street Smart such an intriguing crime drama.The electric Morgan Freeman, at times charismatic, charming, and other
times ferocious and explosive, blows poor Christopher Reeve right off
the screen, but the parts are really arranged this way. Reeve was
picked on by critics for a supposed ""non-performance"" which I feel is
unfair, because the other members of the cast, like Kathy Baker(..as
Fast Money's foxy streetwalker, Punchy) and Freeman, have such colorful
characters to portray. Seeing a nervy Reeve riding along with the unpredictable Freeman who
could turn crazy any moment is particularly effective. Certainly a
highlight is Fast Black(and Punchy)being introduced to the big money
crowd, a party hosted by Fisher's editor Ted(Andre Gregory; A DINNER
WITH ANDRE) commingling with the New York elite, trying to score some
new talent(!). Probably the most frightening scene has Punchy asking
Fast Black to relieve her of duties for a while, sticking up for
herself when he will not hear of it, scissors pulled as a tool to
remind her of who's boss. Seeing Fisher turn the tables on Fast Black
through manipulation in regards to Reggie(Black's enforcer)is quite
gratifying, even though we must accept that this whole scenario grew
from a fictional expose written out of a desire to find success. I
imagine this had to be a relief for Reeve, a way of escape the shadow
of the Man of Steele..this may very well be one of the Cannon group's
most quality films.",97,1987

were working towards the destruction of the country back in 1949. None
of the actors in this Republic B-movie are folks you'll
recognize...which shows what confidence the studio had in this movie!The film begins with a couple driving from California into Arizona. The
lady, in particular, is very nervous and you learn via a LONG flashback
what it's all about and why she's worried. Bill Jones (Robert Rockwell)
is an angry WWII vet. His bitterness attracts the attention of a
Communist recruiter who gets him hooked up with folks who seduce him
gradually into embracing Communism...and they use women to do this
gentle 'guidance'. However, while Bill soon becomes a full-fledged
Commie, some of the women working to convert him towards this system
are beginning to have their doubts...particularly when they see how
vicious their superiors are in dealing with dissent. Bill, too, begins
to see how the Party is filled with jerks...folks who couldn't care
less about truth or equality.So is this film any good? Well, yes and no. As a history teacher, I
must point out that there was a Communist Party USA and many of their
tactics shown in the film are pretty realistic...despite how we tend to
look on the Red Scare as almost comical today. This would especially be
true of the Party just before WWII--when folks went from being lionized
to demonized by them. But it also comes off as a bit over- earnest...a
bit too trite as well---especially at the barf-inducing ending. Subtle,
it sure isn't...but it is entertaining. So, despite low production
values, it does keep your interest.I noticed one review compared this to ""Reefer Madness"". Well, that's
their opinion, but I felt ""The Red Menace"" had much, much better
production values and isn't even close to being as schlocky as ""Reefer
Madness"" or ""Sex Madness"" (by the same production company). This film
is much slicker by comparison...though I gotta admit that speech at the

wants to be, expect to say that it seems to copy the American comedy
movie LIFE AFTER BETH in the tale of a guy who keeps being haunted by
his dead girlfriend, killed in a car accident.What it boils down to is that NINA FOREVER is a mess of a film. It's
long, slow, and has a boring script that drags the viewer down through
endless dialogue scenes that go around in circles and add nothing to
the narrative. The only thing it succeeds in being is grotesque, with
lots of icky sex scenes in which a bloody corpse comes into play. I
also found the whole film to be oddly depressing because it's so poorly
achieved.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have a problem with Fiona
O'Shaughnessy's acting as the oddball Nina. She's weird and has an
annoying personality, yes, but I thought that was the point. No, my
problem is with the two protagonists in this film, both of whom are
hopeless. They're given characters so one-dimensional that they might
as well be caricatures; both have zero personality, and there's no
reason to like them. They meet up in the film and decide to have sex
right away, only to find out there's some ghostly stuff going on. So
what do they do? Not have sex? No, that would be too easy. Instead the
film follows them as they repeatedly try to make things work in the
bedroom, which I found ridiculous. There's more to life than sex after
all.It doesn't help that Cian Barry and Abigail Hardingham aren't very good
actors either, although at least the latter has a nice figure, and
perhaps the reason for her casting was her willingness to show it off.
In any case, NINA FOREVER is a tough film to watch, purely because it's
so dull, vapid, and pointless, and it actually made me feel depressed
about human existence. Surely we're not all this shallow?",98,2015
1170,12.5,6.1,"Many people say that this film could be marked down as a cobweb in John
Woo's closet. It is far from this, but only if you see the full uncencored
version, which is available in the UK for people who own PAL video machines.
I think that this is John Woo's best American made work. Better than Face /
Off, which was well filmed but lacked the Woo stylised violence to keep your
interest up. But Hard Target has plenty. Certain people believe that the end
gunfight in the Mardi Gras graveyard is among Woo's best visually. The
flurry of quick bloody violence is overwhelmingly adrenaline pumping, Van
Damme pumps the bad guys with more bullets in 15 minutes than Desperado did
in two hours! The American Version is quite mediocre compared to the UK
version, the US version contains less violence and if you look in the goofs
section most of the stuff ups are due to the violence being edited out. I do
know where you can get your hands on a rough cut of the 116 minute version
but it is a bit of a waste of time, due to the fact that there is no colour
(except a greeny tone) and most of the 20 minutes extra are just talking.If you think Van Damme is a bit of a let down, he isn't really. He may not
be able to act, but Woo has made him look as cool as ever, seing Van Damme
run around with two hand guns is cool, This movie runs on Van Dammes
precence.Give this film a chance, get the UK version for a better
time.I give this 5 outta 5.John Woo rules the earth.",97,1993
1171,4.0,7.0,"Greetings again from the darkness. Even those of us who consistently
obey the law have a general idea of how criminals work: robbing banks,
stealing cars, kidnapping people, even hacking websites for personal
information. Additionally, the vast majority of us have at least a
rudimentary understanding of how the internet works, and the steps we
take to increase security. Documentarian Alex Winter combines these two
topics as he takes us inside the deep web  specifically Silk Road on
the Darknet.The Surface Web vs The Deep Web - the film exposes what most of us have
very little knowledge of. The simple explanation is that the ""surface
web"" is what we use on a daily basis: Facebook postings photos of our
latest meal and YouTube video sensations showing cats fighting their
mirrored reflection. The Deep Web is what lies beneath. This is the
(mostly) untraceable technology where the underground marketplace site
known as Silk Road exists. To be clear, most of the ongoings on the
deep web are legitimate and in good faith  used frequently by
journalists. However, the other side is how it obtained the nickname
""ebay for Heroin"". Yep, untraceable transactions for illegal drugs
definitely happened (and still do). It turns out that Bitcoin is the
ideal underground currency for this commerce, as it can be as
untraceable as the drug orders.You might recognize the name of director Alex Winter as half of the
classic movie duo in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989). Mr.
Winter released a documentary a couple years ago entitled Downloaded,
where he explored the rise and fall of Napster and the effects of
downloaded music. This current topic is much more dangerous and
secretive, and he wisely brings along his old buddy Keanu Reeves as the
narrator. Winter's approach here is initially a bit confusing, as the
focus seems uncertain  is it a tell all about the deep web, or is it a
profile of Silk Road, or is it an analysis of the arrest and subsequent
trial of possible Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht? Most of the
attention goes to Ulbricht, better known as the Dread Pirate Roberts
(DPR), a pseudonym snatched from the classic movie The Princess Bride.
Is/Was Ulbricht the DPR? Winter is content to leave that mystery
unsolved, but the real story here is how the government put the case
together against Ulbricht  fabricating charges (later dropped),
circumstantial evidence, and a probable breach of privacy.The general belief is that we should have a free and open and secure
internet, though most of us never stop to think what a ludicrous demand
that really is. It's the lack of privacy and ease of breach on the
surface web that led to the development of the deep web  an anonymous
and mostly secure environment. At least it was until the government
went hard after Silk Road. Shutting down the non-violent drug
transactions justified the law enforcement and political attention that
the drug wars along the border never have. Is this a good thing? Is
Ulbricht the DPR? Does it matter that after his arrest, his void was
quickly filled by other opportunists? Do you believe you are secure on
the web? Winter presents an exceptional amount of information that
deserves even more discussion and explanation. That alone makes it time
well spent.",90,2015
1172,13.0,3.1,"It's really not as bad considering the limitations and money these guys
had. I've seen a lot worse efforts. They obviously spent more on
certain stories than others which is to be expected. The connecting
scenes were the worst and probably the most rushed. The sound,
direction and acting leaves a lot to be desired in these segments but
I'm presuming all the money and time went into the stories which I
would imagine were filmed first. I admire independent film makers
making a go of it with very limited options and this one gets a decent
amount right albeit not on a high level.The first story is the best and was genuinely quite creepy and had a
good sense of suspense and scare moments. It's wasn't a new story, but
executed quite well considering. The actors were fine, apart from when
she had to act a bit weird because she chose to overdo the
oddness..especially with her eye-line, which when you consider they
were newlyweds and knew each other pretty well, her behaviour at those
moments would ring enormous alarm bells with me! It would have worked
better if she was more subtle with it. The ending was a bit naff, but
the substance of the overall story well executed.The second story is an well worn story of revenge, but it definitely
had it's moments, especially when the 'victim' meets the bully in
'heavy breathing silence' before the act of violence. In these sorts of
stories, for it to succeed you need to create a certain amount of
understanding with the revenger and I thought, in the short amount of
time to convey this, the writers did an OK job. The Director gave it
space and pace at the right moments. The scene with the parents
watching the cartoon was very good, since it encapsulated everything
about them in a very short space of time and you kind of realised what
sort of life he'd had with them very quickly.The third story was the weakest and I imagine they might have shot it
in one day! Slap hazard and not particularly well thought out and also
unrealistic. You can tell this by the way she grabbed the knife...I
mean really? Also, the decisions made by certain characters were 101 of
how NOT to do things when considering a discerning viewer audience.The connection to all this was the hotel. I understand the title was
changed to Hotel Hell which isn't really what it is about...it's not
about the hotel...the hotel is just a place used a conduit for the main
character to act as a catalyst for the stories. You could argue that
that is why it is a hotel of hell...because of the telling of the
stories..but it just doesn't quite work. Yes, the final eiplogue to the
anthology is based there but it's still not about the hotel...it's
about the characters. The final scenes are disappointing and the fact
the lead actor is in the final story..and very easily recognisable from
that story means there isn't any surprise and it's all rather obvious.
Also...bit plot hole...the videographer gets attacked by the
clown....which goes against what the second story is about. It's about
revenge against those who have done him wrong. The videographer hasn't
done anything to him,doesn't even know him, so it doesn't really make
sense. It's feels like a cheap afterthought to finish the movie.However...really not that bad an effort when all things are considered.",84,2014

Pickles, who captures both the physical grace and tumultuous
personality we associate with the legend of Isadora Duncan. Ken
Russell's expressionistic style of film-making, here in stark black and
white, is so well suited to the ups and downs of such a highly dramatic
biography. As usual, even with a limited budget, Russell offers a
visual feast  filling the screen with lavish interiors and frenzied
close-ups, juxtaposing unrelated scenes simultaneously - quite a
different approach than Karel Reisz's more literal-minded ""Isadora""

is transformed into the savage beast he decides to make slashing the throats

Also an excellent performance from Glynis Barber as Mrs.Jekyll. Atmospheric

Come Back. It's not only a good sex comedy for Doris and Rock, but it's
also a very funny satire on the advertising business of Madison Avenue.In Pillow Talk Doris was an interior decorator and Rock a songwriter.
They haven't changed their characters at all, but now are both in the
advertising business. Through an incredible combination of circumstances I couldn't possibly
write Rock has created commercials for a product that doesn't exist and
the doofus son of the agency he works for, Tony Randall, has ordered
them given full blown airing. With Doris nipping at his heels for
unethical practices, Rock and Tony hire a nutty scientist played by
Jack Kruschen to come up with some kind of product for the commercials.In the meantime Doris mistakes Rock for the scientist and now we're
back to the plot of Pillow Talk as Rock decides to make some time with
Doris. It gets pretty wild and wacky, especially after Kruschen invents
something that has some very unforeseen consequences.All the cast members do just fine in this very bright comedy that has
me splitting a gut with laughter every time I see it. In addition to
the cast members mentioned, I should also single out Edie Adams as the
southern model who Hudson makes the commercials with.Also to be singled out in what turned out to be his farewell screen

title didn't sound that appealing and the few scenes that I saw didn't
look very interesting. But what can I say? I was little then and didn't
know what I was missing. My mother kept telling me how good of a movie
this was, but I was just too stubborn and didn't pay attention. It was
only a few months ago that I decided to watch it when it appeared on TV
and boy was I surprised!!This movie is beyond anything that I have ever viewed in my entire
life. Usually, this sort of movie isn't the kind that I look at, but I
fell in love with the story and the characters, as well as the
wonderful actresses (Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson,
and Mary-Louise Parker) who did an outstanding job portraying their
characters in a unique and unforgettable way.Since I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it, let
me just say that it's an astounding tale of a special friendship that

1178,12.8,6.7,"The Invitation is, in a word, irritating. It overflows with
unnecessarily jumpy flashbacks and blurred memories in an effort to
appear mysterious. The movie wants you to believe that it is
complicated and deep. But it isn't. The movie is simple and shallow.The filmmakers spend so much time stuffing our faces with distracting,
strange music and even stranger behavior of the dinner guests in an
attempt to unnerve viewers. They want you to find the evening weird
(which it is) and confusing (which it isn't) so you will have doubts
about what will happen (you shouldn't because the answer is obvious).Here is the premise of the movie (I will write this as simplistically
as the movie presents it). Old friends who haven't seen each other in
years all arrive at a dinner party hosted by one friend and her new
husband. The night is basically a reunion except everyone is a little
uncomfortable to see each other again. So actually it's just a reunion.As the evening carries on the hosts exhibit increasingly odd behaviors,
which make the guests uncomfortable and the protagonist (a bearded,
long-haired man named Will) suspicious. The hosts are both awkwardly
happy, which the hostess explains is due to their choice to do away
with negative emotions. As if human beings can simply choose not to
experience any undesirable feelings. Her pontification is extremely
irritating to hear and extremely false.Later, the hosts show everyone a video of a 20something year old cancer
patient dying and beam about how wonderful it is, how wonderful death
is because it is the only way to truly be free.""Are you guys in a cult?"" One guest blurts the question that needed
asking.They are. Obviously. Of course they deny half-heartedly then attempt to
distract everyone with a bizarre new party game. I'll spare the
details, just know that it makes the guests uncomfortable.After watching this scene, most viewers probably expect the remainder
of the movie's plot to play out in a painfully predictable sequence. It
does. Once again I will spare the details since certain readers may
still want to watch this movie for some reason. Rest assured that
nothing will surprise you.I mentioned how much this movie irritated me, and I want to briefly
speak on that point once more. I will mention particulars about the
opening scene and how it connects with the remainder of the movie. Here
we go.*Minor Spoiler Alert* The film opens with a couple (Will and his
girlfriend) driving to a dinner party that neither seems particularly
excited to attend, a relatable concept for many of us. The car suddenly
hits a coyote, in serves as the first jump scare of the movie. Will
exits the vehicle to inspect the situation and eventually mercy kills
the animal with a tire iron.I am uncertain about the purpose of this scene. Maybe it was merely an
unsettling appetizer for the uncomfortable dinner party that followed.
Perhaps it was just a red herring, like much of the movie. Maybe it was
intended to introduce the cult's message that dying is the only way to
escape from pain.Maybe, but I hope not because it's a terrible parallel to the beliefs
of the cult member dinner hosts. The coyote's circumstances don't apply
at all to any of the attendees of the dinner party. The coyote
experiences excruciating pain and will die within minutes. The people
were not injured. None of them were hit by cars. None of them are sick.
They are going to live healthy and happy lives for the next 40 or 50
years. Sure, they have their struggles, but they will have plenty of
opportunities to be happy. The coyote will not.*End of Spoiler* And I'm finished. Sorry for the rant. The whole movie

better. To avoid similar irritation of your own, I recommend watching
something else.",100,2015

success is no surprise but also his downfall is no surprise. How he
turns could have been overplayed or understated for an actor with more
ego. The scene was necessary and effective because in the end this
movie was not about glamorizing gangsters. Cohen's contributions are
also significant. He understood he wasn't making a message film, even
though the message is there. The movie is full of bloody violence (it
seemed to me that during the pool massacre, some of the victims were
spouting blood before they were shot) because that was what fans of

which are good representations of Australian animation apart from the
odd disappointment. The Dot film series and Blinky Bill are notable
examples.So when hearing that there was an animated film from 2015, part of me
was enthused and was interested into seeing it. After watching it, it
is watchable and has its likability, but it was rather disappointing as
to how unremarkable the overall film felt at the end of the day. Those
who grew up with Blinky Bill may find themselves disappointed at
'Blinky Bill: The Movie' missing an opportunity to bring back the
original voice cast even for a short appearance or doing it in
hand-drawn animation, which would have made it feel closer in spirit.Nothing is done terribly in 'Blinky Bill: The Movie', but not much is
done exceptionally at the same time. The most consistent aspects are
the music and voice acting. The music is rich in energy and robust as
well as with times where it's pathos-filled and understated. The voice
acting is very good all round from the likes of Ryan Kwanten, Toni
Collette, Rufus Sewell, Richard Roxburgh and Barry Humphries, with the
only regret really not bringing the original voice actors back even it
was just for a short appearance.Even though they don't have much depth to them the characters are cute
and likable, with Blinky showing easily identifiable traits (apart from
the lying to his mother). The Australian stereotypes can be pretty
cringe-worthy however.Animation in 'Blinky Bill: The Movie' is a mixed bag. Done in CGI
rather than traditional hand drawn animation, there has certainly been
far worse-looking CGI (looking at you Video Brinquedo and Spark Plug
Entertainment) but far better as well (Pixar for example). The colours
are bright and colourful and the characters mostly well modelled but
the backgrounds can lack detail and fluidity, they don't look that
vivid and transitions can look choppy and unfinished.Writing is also mixed. There are some amusing moments, the film
certainly has its heart in the right place and does have a lot of heart
and charm and the messaging of perseverance amongst others are
sincerely presented. It is cliché ridden however, with some crude adult
humour and language too that really doesn't belong with the rest of the
film, just felt like a clumsy attempt to draw in a wider audience.Story is one of the weaker assets, despite having a lovely idea that
actually is not that far off in spirit to Gross' Blinky Bill outings.
It does have parts that are bright and breezy and there is heart and
charm. Other parts are rather pedestrian and the film never shakes off
its constant and at times excessive predictability.Overall, watchable but unremarkable. 5/10 Bethany Cox",0,2015

actually two people that said the exact same thing about the film. And
that was that the film should have ended when the priest was looking
into the house and he sees the spirit of the dead girl walking. Then
the old lady comes up to him and says she has heard stories about the
house. That would have been an awesome way to end it and I then would
have given it a ten. As it stands I am still giving it an 8 because
even though the end was contrived and straight out of The Exorcist, it
is still one hell of a scary film. And if you thought you had reason in
the first one to yell "" Get out!"" then wait till you see this one.The first hour of this film is absolutely terrifying. It has so much
atmosphere and chilling scenes that I couldn't understand why people
hated this film so much. The room in the basement is dark, dingy and
the camera work is so spooky that you can't help but get suckered into
believing that something is in there. When the mom is ironing and she
feels something touch her arm and then the wind, that was a perfect
scene. It was frightening. But the highlight of this film is when the
family minus Sonny goes to church. It is here that Sonny gets stalked
by an unseen force. And I even caught myself yelling at the TV, "" GET
OUT! "" When he goes up the stairs and then down and then back up again
into his room, it bothered me and it literally gave me chills. The
camera work is so creative and haphazard that you really can't tell
where the demon is. Is it on the ceiling, behind him, in front of him,
where? That was a brilliant sequence in the film.Some of the acting is pretty bad especially from the mom, but it makes
up for that with its chills and tension. I really think that people
that criticize this film are perhaps people that should watch it again.
I saw it for the first time when I was about 16 and thought it was
okay, but then I rented it today and it frightened me during the day.
That is pretty good film making. And is it me or are Italian directors
better at good horror than the average north American director? Because
I've seen some pretty scary horror films that were directed by Italians
and they seem to have a style all their own. Just a thought.Amityville II is a perfect film to watch before the original. It is
actually a prequel and it is good to watch them back to back. Give this
film a chance and I'll bet it will scare you. It did a pretty good job

supernatural, he is more pumped up. It's a fun movie. Yes, it has its issues, it is not perfect, but it
still makes for a fun watch when you need to take your mind off of
things. Lyle Alzado does a GREAT job for his original profession at being an

acting-wise.Problems with the movie: I think Lyle Alzado could have been
incorporated more into the movie, and when he was there, in a more
violent, destructive way. In the movie, he kills people with mundane
tools. A jackhammer, blow torch, hanging, and off screen decapitation.
Nothing that would involve super-human strength as the poster and plot
suggest. I also think certain characters should have had more screen
time, AND more actions and events they performed. (Including Anthony
Perkins, who is fun as the sarcastic director, but his scenes are
limited. Rewire, the comic relief, is also someone who should have had
more screen time.) Overall, without spoiling anything; ""Destroyer"" is a fun watch if you
like low-budget movies and movies that are fun. It has issues, and it
is not to be dissected. Just watch it for fun, take it for what it was
made on, it's a fun time.7/10",94,1988
1188,8.4,6.4,"I remember seeing A Life Less Ordinary back in the late 1990s with high
expectations as Trainspotting was one, and still is, one of my all time
favorite films. What I got was a different film, but not in a bad way.
It was fun and very different from anything else that came out around
that time. But the funny thing was that after I saw it I kept thinking
about it, little things; lines and camera shots that stuck in my head.
By the time I watched it again, a week or so later, it was like the
film was an old friend. There is a charm in every scene of A Life Less
Ordinary and if you are able to pick up on it the film is a great
experience. People I know are split on the film, most think its just
OK. Although I enjoy ALLO its not perfect, some parts don't work very
well and come across as corny, but the good, my man Ewan is just great
as the lovable loser, far outweighs the bad and thats why it has a
place in my film collection.no quote(This review was originally written by a man but then a robot replaced

1189,12.8,4.7,"...But, when all was said and done, I just couldn't. Could it have been
better? Yes. Was it as bad as others here have written? No. I think the
reason people here have given it a bad review, is that it IS lacking in
some respects, however, it's an interesting story, original in it's
execution. It's filmed beautifully, for a horror film. My kudos to the
Cinematographer, it looks amazing.I think most people now a days want their ghost stories to have more
'jump scares' and less 'story' and THAT'S why it's getting bad reviews.
If they were more familiar with Rod Serling, or had seen some of the
Hammer Film movies, they'd appreciate this one more.This movie takes the typical 'abandoned cabin in the woods' story to an
entirely different area, tying into 'true events' and putting a solid
twist ending to good use.I rated it a 7-10 because I think what this movie really needed was
MORE Thomas Jane, and maybe some John Carpenter-esque sound tracks, but
over all I enjoyed this movie more than I expected it to.",93,2016

1191,7.5,6.2,"As a frequent cinema goer I can appreciate when a filmmaker tries
something new. I like it when a movie takes a risk. But it is called a
risk for a reason. Michael Dougherty took some risks with Krampus and
while I admire the effort, I didn't care for the resulting product.Krampus is that movie that tries just a little too hard. Everything
feels forced. The comedy. The ""scary"" moments. This movie desperately
wants to be this generation's Gremlins and it isn't. Not by a long
shot.This movie is not without its positives. The actors in this movie do a
very good job and I was very close to caring about their characters'
fates. But the good acting is wasted on the movie thanks to its clichéd
dialogue. And the exception of this would be Conchatta Farrell. She
plays the same loud, brash, sarcastic old broad that she annoyed us
with for years on Two and a Half Men. I can't help but think that a
better actress who could play the type of character they were aiming
for, like a Kathy Bates, would have made the character more sympathetic
and the movie a little better.The biggest problem with this movie is it doesn't ever really decide if
it's a horror or a comedy. It gets more serious at the end as horror
comedies naturally do but by that time you really don't care about
these characters. It was a horror movie that didn't make you root for
the bad guy per se, but man was I waiting for everyone to die. There
are scenes where these people are getting attacked by their toys (yeah,
I know. Stupid.) and you can't tell if you're supposed to laugh or be
terrified. I laughed at how unterrifying the creatures were but I'm
sure that wasn't the filmmaker's intent.And as for the creatures, once again I appreciate the deviation from
the norm and using practical effects, but they are really cheesy and
look too puppet-y. First off, we see some toys come to life and attack
the family. Sounds like a real scary Christmas scenario. But the toys
that come to life are a jack in the box; something that hasn't been
under a Christmas tree in about 50 years, a porcelain doll that
wouldn't be a suitable gift for ANY of the female characters, and an
obviously CGI killer teddy bear. But my biggest complaint is the actual
Krampus creature itself. The movie shows you flashes of the villain and
even got me excited to see what this thing looks like. Then when they
show the Krampus it looks like a prop from a local theater production.
At that point, I wish they had never shown him, the mystery would have
been way better.The movie's story is just flat out inconsistent. For a good while you
forget about the Krampus completely because of the endless attacks from
his minions. You never get any kind of explanation as to where everyone
else in this town went to. The grandma character was most frustrating.
They used the very annoying foreign language ploy to get more dialogue
on the page. As in the character says something in a foreign language,
another character asks what they said and yet ANOTHER character
translates. See how I just wasted three sentences to explain something
that could have been done with one? Yeah, THAT annoying. She also
happens to be the living exposition machine. Why is this happening?
Grandma will explain after the fact when saying this earlier might have
saved a person's life but whatever, I guess. And at the end they kill
off about 4 or 5 characters within a matter of seconds. It's as if they
realized they had too many survivors at the end and just sloppily had
the creature take them out.The most disappointing aspect of the film is its comedy, or lack
thereof. I know how subjective comedy is but you see every joke coming
from a mile away like you do this film's jump scares. Maybe it's the
Conchatta Farrell thing bothering me still but the jokes feel like they
were written by the staff of Two and a Half Men. It's just set up,
break, punchline, repeat. They never take advantage of any physical
comedy that could come out from a story like this.Overall, you could see that everyone really tried on this movie but the
execution left so much to be desired. I wouldn't recommend seeing this
in a theater simply from a financial standpoint. If you're still
curious about this one by the time it gets to disc, go ahead and rent
it if only to feed your curiosity. No offense but if you're a teenager
you might really enjoy this one. I saw plenty of teens enjoying this
one and laughing at the jokes I groaned over. So who knows? Maybe I'm
just too old for this one.4 out of 10 stars",98,2015
1192,7.75,6.6,"Loosely based on the exploits of Red Adair, Hellfighters is a perfect
vehicle for John Wayne. The characterizations are a bit overstated, but
this was standard for the era, so I allow for that. And who could have
picked a more appropriate love interest for the Duke than Vera Miles as
a San Francisco Department Store heiress.I thought Jim Hutton and Katherine Ross made a good offsetting couple
to JW & VM and Bruce Cabot, a long-time associate of Wayne's, an
excellent comic element.I think the thing that sold it for me was the reality of the fire
scenes which I just marveled at until I saw that Red Adair was a
technical adviser on the film. That and the knowledge that Wayne was
all for reality as much as possible really made me a watch it anytime

it

1194,11.4,6.6,"Having paid my debt to the library, I was once again able to rent DVDs
from them, and I got right back into the swing of things with this
western from 1968. I like westerns as much as the next guy, but
honestly, I checked it out because it was a Raquel Welch film, and like
most of her oeuvre, it's basically harmless but hardly ever aspires to
be anything other than mildly satisfying.There's some odd casting in Bandolero; Dean Martin (!!) plays Dee
Bishop, a ne'er do well, and Jimmy Stewart (!!) plays his brother Mace
(what is this, Star Wars?), a slightly more noble ne'er do well. Will
Geer  best known as Grandpa on the Waltons  is along for the ride as
a cantankerous old outlaw named Pops, and George Kennedy rounds out the
cast as the simple but good-hearted sheriff with a name far better than
the rest of the film, July Johnson. Lastly of course, we have Welch
(note how I avoided using the 'rounding out' joke on her?), who plays
Maria Stoner, a Mexican ex-whore who has married a rich man and is his
trophy wife (shades of Anna Nicole Smith). When Dee kills Stoner in the
first reel, Maria is left all alone, and is taken hostage by Dee after
his narrow escape from the gallows.The plot is fairly straightforward; the sheriff loves the woman who
will have nothing to do with him, and he tracks her all over God's
brown earth (i.e., Mexico) to get her back. Inexplicably she falls in
love with her husband's murderer (Raquel falling for Dean Martin?
That's like Natalie Portman falling for Patrick Dempsey. Come on) as
they travel deeper into bandito country. As we get to know the
characters we find that pretty much everyone other than Dee and his
brother in the outlaw gang is a rotten apple (which is such a shock,
seeing as how they are bank robbers), and only Mace really has any
couth at all.Martin, ostensibly the star, is okay here. I never considered him much
of an actor, but he's serviceable here. Welch is okay; mostly she has
to look good, which isn't hard for her (her hair and nails are always
impeccable). I liked Will Geer's world-weary sarcasm and venality,
mostly because it was such a change from Grandpa. And Kennedy tries his
best to be a likable simpleton, playing everything straight and honest;
July's a good guy, but there's not enough to him to tug much at our
sympathies. The big surprise is Stewart, who doesn't really seem right
for the role of an aging desperado; but his insistence on playing it
just less than serious is terrific, and most of his scenes right up
until the end are highly amusing. In fact he and Martin have surprising
comedic chemistry, and several of their scenes play as asides, everyone
stopping what they are doing to listen to the two brothers riff.
Stewart imbues the film with some much-needed humor, and steals the
show at the same time.Bandolero isn't remembered as a classic, with good reason, but it isn't
a bad film. It would be forgettable if not for Stewart, but with his
comedic licks it rises to be a moderately engaging comedy. There are
scores of better westerns, and even better Welch films (and many better
Stewart films), but overall, for an evening's diversion, you could do
much, much worse.",106,1968
1195,6.0,7.4,"Films based on novels (as in this case) must rely on screenplays which
condense the material, and supply either voice-overs, or visuals to
explain what is going on in a character's head. Usually, a voice-over
is a cop-out. David Lean has provided a brilliant substitute for a
voice-over in the scene where Adela wanders on her bicycle into the
bush to discover a Hindu temple. A central mystery in the book as well
as in the film is the ambiguity of the cause for the court case.
Forster said that judgment was up to the reader. Lean was a reader, and
in my view, he made his decision, and provided us with a clue in that
scene (which is not in the book). Here is that scene: Adela leaves the
safe British compound on an exploratory trip with a bicycle. She leaves
the highway, and cycles down a path through the weeds. The sign- post,
which had appeared quite natural when she looked at it, now looks like
a Christian Cross when she leaves the road and goes down the path. The
music changes from a major key to the minor, suggesting mystery, or
menace. She is leaving her familiar culture and riding into the
unknown. She sees a fallen sculpture. A voluptuous sculpture. She
doesn't turn back. As she rides farther, the weeds grow higher. She is
being engulfed by India. She dismounts as she approaches a copse, and
walks into the shadows. She sees a ruined Hindu temple covered with
erotic sculptures. Amourous couples are coupling. She stares at these
apparitions, so abandoned, and so alien to her proper Victorian
up-bringing. She is attracted by the spectacle, but she is frightened
by her attraction. Suddenly she hears a noise, and looks up to see a
troop of monkeys. They chatter menacingly at her and begin to scamper
down the temple, over the erotic sculpture, and in panic she flees.
Could the monkeys symbolize that emotional, sensual, animal nature that
lives in everyone but is supposed to be suppressed in Englishwomen (and
American ones, for that matter!)? Are they saying, ""This is our land,
the land of emotion; you do not belong here""? India attracts her. It
awakens hidden desires. It menaces her. She flees to the familiar,
visibly shaken. Back at the bungalow, with her fiancé, she says ""I want
to take back what I said at the polo,"" which was that she wanted to
delay the wedding. She was so frightened by the feelings rising in her
as she tasted a bit of Indian culture that she wanted to put a stop to
passion by marrying! And all of that was said in the film without
words. It provides us with a rationale for believing she later suffered
an hallucination, which is at the core of the plot.",0,1984
1196,8.5,8.3,"What a wonderful way to spend an evening--dinner, Christmas and New Year's
with CC Baxter (Jack Lemmon) and 'friends', accompanied by much champagne
and laughter, and spaghetti and meatballs lovingly prepared by the host
himself. There's even a game of gin rummy to get into that Baxter and Fran
can't ever seem to finish--here's hoping it never does!THE APARTMENT is one of those truly classic classic movies--for one thing,
it has an absolutely top-notch cast, featuring Jack Lemmon (at his wryly
humourous best); Shirley MacLaine (a glowing screen presence); Fred
MacMurray (smarm personified); and a younger Ray Walston (still
wisecracking, still hilarious). They also benefit from a clever, perceptive
and timelessly relevant script by Billy Wilder, under his capable direction.
Though there are plenty of brilliant one-liners, the best of the dialogue
feels true and real, which adds to the feeling that you've known Baxter et
al for years. I loved the score to the movie as well, artfully attributed to
the Rickshaw Boys and used to great effect.There are so many good moments scattered throughout the film (I can't even
begin to enumerate them all here!). A lot of them are little touches that
must have been added by the actors themselves (Jack Lemmon humming as he
prepares the meatball sauce is just *so* funny!). I love the madness of the
Christmas party scene, and when Baxter's doctor-neighbour takes charge of
the situation with Fran, slapping her awake and marching her around the
living room. I also love it when Baxter first starts playing gin rummy with
Fran, and she reveals how she has a talent for falling for the wrong guy all
the time. Best of all, Lemmon makes such a believable, sweet pushover that
you often want to shake him and hug him at the same time--the things he
would do for Fran! It makes his final scene with MacMurray that much more
satisfying for the audience.If you see this gem of a movie on a video store shelf, or (even better)
playing in the cinema, don't let it pass you by. Join Baxter, Fran, Mr.
Sheldrake and everyone else, and have a great time!",125,1960
1197,5.0,7.1,"The Korean cop-thieves films are quite extraordinary and I had seen
plenty of them. This is based on kind of similar theme. Instead the
gang here it is a cop who face-off a millionaire. This is not
completely a serious action-crime, but a bit of fun too, that was well
written and directed by 'The Berlin File' filmmaker. The film was a
huge hit in the domestic market, but I felt the runtime was slightly a
lengthy with some few boring parts. Overall, the film was entertaining,
that reached close to my expectation.Before coming to the main story, the film tells a couple of quick crime
solving events in its first act. It was the story of an honest, but a
tough police officer when it comes to the crimes and criminals. That's
how he ends up on one of the greatest case he has ever taken in the
hand. Though, it all begins when one of the truck drivers was badly
injured after protesting over his termination from the job without the
pay. That brings a young wealthy businessman into the frame for the
head-to-head clash between him and the cops. In the end who wins, the
corporate house with their financial power and political influence or
the limbless police force is the remaining.The opening was so hilarious, I thought I had to prepare for the laugh
riot, but then the middle parts failed to keep the same intensity.
Precisely to say there's nothing much happened, not the interesting
stuffs. That is where the audience has to watch out, because this is
not one hundred per cent comedy. But somehow the story kept moving in a
right direction, especially the clash between the cops and corporate,
at least in a draggy pace. When the final act commenced, I felt the
previous developments came in handy to set the stage for a great
finish.""I told you to stay out of trouble.""Quite refreshing from the regular cop films. I did not anticipate the
amusing characters like this, not from the cops. Only the cops, but the
character sets from the opposite were inverted like 'the masks of
comedy and tragedy'. The whole cop team, including the chief was so
funny. There are loads of small scale jokes that brighten up our mood.
But like I said, once the narration approaches the midway, especially
after a business tycoon was introduced, all the fun parts were
beginning to fade away. That's the reminder for the commencement of the
other facet of the story.So the film takes the us to the vital segment of the narration where
the intensified confrontation takes place. But only the twist spells
even more interest in us about the tale's ending. Nothing any
breathtaking secrets revealed, yet absolutely best and smart
turnaround. The struggling police force against their rival was
brilliantly told. In reality, I don't think things can happen like
that, but for a movie, it was fun as well as thrilling with some
awesome stunt sequences.The actors too showed their potential. I think it is a good film to
remake, but there are few areas to improve like overall pace of the
film. When the film started, it took me around half an hour to get used
to everything about the film. From the characters to the situations
they are in, it needs a serious attention from us, but the other side
the length of the film is a worrisome. I enjoyed watching it, so no
doubt it was a good film, but should have been even better than that.I would say it missed an opportunity to be one of a fine cop film. Not
because of the attachment of the comedies, but separating and
randomising them from the other heavy events makes it an inconsistent
to keep up the same momentum throughout, especially like during facing
the bad guys. If you watch the film's ending you will understand what I
meant.So these kind of flaws are minors, that comes under the screenplay's
error when the scenes in the story failed to flow in a same flat
surface. That's what I felt, yet I know I'm not an expert in that
field, but I have experience watching films like that. So I won't
complain the overall film, surely I can recommend it for those who like
cop story. Though the one thing you have to keep in your mind is that
it is not a serious recital, but something like seeing a film Jackie
Chan in a cop avatar.7/10",123,2015

complex tale with time travel as the main theme. The story also has
some good twists and humor.THE GOOD - Kudos to the four s's in here: Silver, suspense,
special-effects and sound - all of them are very good. There is
something about Ron Silver's looks that spell ""sleazy and rotten""
before he even opens his mouth! When he speaks, his accent and
profanity quickly verifies those suspicions. The special- effects - at
least when this came out in the mid '90s - were very cool when the time
travelers reached their destinations and appear out of this wall of
near- transparent plastic. The story can be a bit confusing at times
but is fun at most times, especially near the end when doubles of all
the characters are on the screen at onceTHE BAD - The bad part of the film is the credibility, especially with
Silver who plays a politician. No politician, no matter what party or
where, would be this much of low-life. In fact, the story is full of
unlikable and untrustworthy characters, too many of them. There also is
too much Rambo-mentality and the final action goes on way too long. The

woman with very defined eyebrows (Kate) and her teenage kids (shifting
from bratty to sweet in the same scene) camping, and yells at them for

been raised by wolves? Why is the small ""town"" that random guy mentions

made! It's so epic, and it does a great job of showcasing the original
Peanuts characters, especially the central character, Charlie Brown! It
told a tragic story of Charlie Brown, the milquetoast little boy who works
hard to be the best (trying everything from kite-flying to baseball to
even
competing at a spelling bee), so that he can be loved and respected by his
friends, when, of course, he usually loses and his friends berate him.

legendary jazz musician Vince Guaraldi, conductor John Scott Trotter, and
gifted musician/poet/singer Rod McKuen really shines, and is the best
score

Linus practicing ""I before E, except after C,"" Schroeder playing
Beethoven's
Pathetique Sonata (2nd movt.) on his piano, and Snoopy skating at the
Rockerfeller Center in NY, where Charlie Brown goes for the national
spelling bee, but these are great images that make this movie all the more

December of '69 (incidentally Rod McKuen performed one of the movie's
songs
months earlier at his birthday concert at Carnegie Hall, which can be
purchased on a CD called ""Rod McKuen: At Carnegie Hall""). There was also
a
documentary of the same name (the soundtrack of which is available on CD),

first saw it(a million years ago) I thought it was so laughably bad
that I enjoyed watching it. Then recently I had a few drinks then got
the great idea of watching it again. I couldn't pull myself off of the
floor from laughing so hard. Geez, the sound, video quality, acting,
editing, EVERYTHING about this movie is bad. There should be a warning
on the cover suggesting that viewers prepare themselves for the
possibility of laughing themselves into a stupor.Anyway, this movie is freaking great. Check this movie out without
hesitation. If you watch it sober, you'll laugh at it normally, but
when you got a few in ya, the laughs don't stop. You hear that punk,

taste in cheesy, violant, Slasher/or not, horror movies. I'm now starting to
wach more and more horror B- movies
(anything by Troma team video I highly recommend).
But back to the monster squad its all about these kids who are
really into the whole idea of monsters and stuff. So, they start this
Monster club(Hence the name ""monster squad"").
But the craziest thing happens, Dracula, Frankienstien, The Mummy, The

released. It has stuck in my mind ever since. The combination of Gary
Cooper's world weary persona, Dimitri Tiomkin's evocative score, the
great rendition of the title song by Frankie Laine and the powerful
sense of loss and what might have been all combine to make a fantastic
couple of hours. One thought did occur when I watched it again last
night was how old the characters all were... We take it for granted
today that most roles are played by 25-35 year old actors (and
actresses)that to see Cooper, Stanwyck, Quinn, Bond etc. brings one up
with start. Lovely film, though, and I look forward to seeing it again.",90,1953
1209,7.5,0.0,"I had always heard about Scalps as people say it's Fred Olen Ray's best
horror flick. Well if this is his best, I'd hate to see the rest! The
film starts off a little dull, but starts to get better as the group
make their way into the mountains. The atmosphere is quite creepy in a
low-budget kind of way and reminded me slightly of The Evil Dead, plus
the location is similar to The Hills Have Eyes. I love the shot of the
rotting skeleton when the car goes past, but no one sees it.Once they have set up camp, the group hear mysterious drumming, see
strange faces in campfires, and so on. There are some hilarious lines
such as ""I broke a fingernail!"", and also when the girl says that the
drumming is coming from hell. The scalping scene is probably the
highlight of the film, and is brilliantly done - it really surprised
me. When the girls throat is cut, she writhes around in agony and it
looks realistic. Also the part where he removes her scalp is really
cool. There's another good gore scene when a mans head is chopped off,
but it's not quite as impressive.Overall, Scalps is worth a watch if you can tolerate low budget horror.
It's nothing amazing, but does have a low budget charm about it.",0,1983
1210,11.0,7.1,"Growing up I always had a pretty utopian view on what being a teenager
in high school would be like. Once I got there, it was nothing like
what I had thought, and plus we had no kids that looked like James
Spader. Just because high school was not like a John Hughes film didn't
make it a bad thing, I just think I would have had more fun at those
schools than mine. Now a day in the perfect world is not what people
want, they want something real, and in ""The Spectacular Now"" it feels
like what being a teenager feels like today.Now being a middle-aged man this is only a guess, but it sure feels
right on. Sutter (Miles Teller) is that guy everyone likes, you know
the life if any party. Sutter is enjoying every minute of high school,
great times, and a great girlfriend named Cassidy (Brie Larson) to top
it off. Sutter also likes to drink, and not the typical teenage
drinking, he goes as far as carrying a flask and even putting alcohol
in anything he drinks. After Cassidy breaks up with him, Sutter drinks
a little too much and ends up passed out in the front of a house, not
his own. He is found by Aimee (Shailene Woodley), who knows Sutter from
school. Sutter starts to gather interest in Aimee, but all the while
hoping to land back with the women he thinks he wants in Cassidy. Aimee
has never had a boyfriend and quickly starts to fall for Sutter hard.
With school ending soon, Sutter is all about the now, and has no idea
what his future will hold, he never wants to grow up, because where is
the fun in that? A lot of people think that their high school years were their highest
point in their life. I mean you have no worries, no responsibilities,
you just live life. Everything is easier, including love because how
innocent everything is. Sutter and Aimee are at that point where things
start to move, college and life are in front of them making them have
to make choices they never had to before. Written by Scott Neustadter
and Michael Weber (500 Days of Summer) from the book by Tim Tharp, the
story is a real coming of age story. I know that is a bad description,
but where so many coming of age stories fail, this one soars. It is all
perfectly directed by James Ponsoldt (Smashed), who set the movie in
his home town of Athens, Georgia, and even shot the film in locations
he grew up in. It all comes together by the flawless performances by
Woodley and Teller who are perfect for each other on screen. I
sometimes think what it would be like to grow up in this day and age,
well I think I just got to see what life is like today and like this
movie it looks spectacular.Brian Taylor http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",95,2013
1211,11.2,6.5,"Hollywood loves assassins. You can't go more than a few weeks without a
new hit-man movie hitting (sorry) the multiplexes. Hell, later this
year, there's a movie coming out literally called ""Hitman"".The new trend seems to be putting comedic twists on the assassin film.
I guess we can thank Tarantino for that. Within the past few years,
stuff like ""Mr.& Mrs. Smith"", ""The Whole Nine Yards"", ""The Matador"",
""Grosse Pointe Blank"", and ""Lucky Number Slevin"" gave us clever little
plays on the assassin genre. If you're at all familiar with those
films, you'll feel right at home with ""You Kill Me"".Ben Kingsley plays Frank Falenczyk, a hit-man for the Polish Mob out of
Buffalo, New York. Frank's an alcoholic, and recently it's been
affecting his work. As a result, his superiors send him to San
Francisco to attend Alcoholics Anonymous until he can sober up.The movie doesn't win any points for originality, but it does have a
lot to offer. Kingsley puts on a capable, sympathetic show - pretty
impressive for a guy who spends the majority of the film getting
hammered. Téa Leoni does well enough as the obligatory love interest.
The age difference took a little getting used to. Dennis Farina and
Philip Baker Hall are a treat to watch playing essentially the same
roles they've been playing forever. Hall is the soft spoken head of the
Polish Mob Family, while Farina is the loudmouth villain heading up the
Italians. Bill Pullman also has a small role as a sleazy real estate
agent. Anyone who's seen ""Lucky Numbers"" knows that Pullman has a
talent for quirky lowlifes, and he shines here.This is a very light movie. It won't blow you away in any regards, but
it is a solid 90 minutes of easy entertainment. The script is
essentially Frank's struggle to fight his habit. We also get a light
love story and a touch of crime thriller. It's a strange juggling act,
but Kingsley and director John Dahl pull it off. Don't get discouraged
by the bland name. With just enough laughs, drama, and action  this is
a small movie than just about anybody can have fun with.",93,2007

as much money out of men as possible without giving them any actual
sex. The studs form a club to learn how to scam as much sex out of the
women without actually giving them any money. That's it. That is the

1213,8.333333333333334,7.8,"1973 was a very good year for legendary director/choreographer Bob
Fosse. He won an Emmy for directing and choreographing the television
special LIZA WITH A Z, he won a Tony for directing the Broadway musical
PIPPIN, and blindsided Francis Ford Copolla by winning an Oscar for
Best Director for CABARET, the dazzling 1972 film version, which is
Fosse's re-thinking of the 1966 Broadway musical. The stage and screen
versions are quite different and as independent works, they stand on
their own as outstanding achievements and it is not necessary to have
seen the play to appreciate the movie. The main focal point of Fosse's
re-thinking of the musical is that he wanted it to be a more
""realistic"" musical and therefore made sure that all of the musical
numbers (with the exception of ""Tomorrow Belongs to Me"")all took place
within the walls of the Kit Kat Club. He cut several numbers from the
original score, but if you listen, some of them can be heard as
background music in several scenes. He also shifted the focus of the
way the story is told...the play tells the story from the leading man's
point of view, but Fosse switches the focus to the character of Sally
Bowles, the brassy, sassy party girl who believes in ""divine decadence'
and wears bright green fingernail polish. Fosse also takes two
secondary characters from the play, who are older, and makes them young
and attractive in order to make their story more youth-friendly, I
imagine. Liza Minnelli turns in a dazzling Oscar-winning performance as
Sally, a gutsy, self-absorbed party girl who shows signs of
vulnerability and a desperate need to be loved. Minnelli makes the most
of her musical and non-musical moments in the film...her climactic
confrontation with Brian (Michael York)is brilliantly performed. York
is charming and sexy as Brian and Joel Grey's Oscar winning turn as the
Master of Ceremonies is a delight. The musical numbers are all
brilliantly staged and performed, from the opening number ""Willkomenn""
to the new ""Money"" song performed by Minnelli and Grey, to ""Maybe this
Time"", the ballad belted out by Minnelli onstage in the empty club.
Fosse cleverly counterparts the musical numbers with the realities of
what is going on in Nazi Occupied 1931 Berlin with sometimes startling
effect. ""Tomorrow Belongs to Me"" still gives me goosebumps every time I
watch the film. This film ruled at the '73 Oscars, winning eight awards
in all (it lost Best Picture to THE GODFATHER)and deserved every
accolade it received. A sparkling, eye-popping, thought-provoking,
haunting film experience that should be savored over and over again.",124,1972

game. During his skyrocketing career, Johnathan has to experience what
Alexi has found out: Blood brings more viewing pleasure to the
audience. In a final game, Johnathan and his team have to fight for
mere survival.Back in 1975, James Caan brought us a brutal movie in which you can
literally hear every bone in the players body break. Now, John McTieran
has brought that film to us again, for a new generation. With stars
like LL Cool J, Rebbeca Romijn and Chris Klein you would expect it to
be a pretty bad remake, but this is not the case. Rollerball does the
unthinkable and gives Psycho a running for it's money as the worst
remake ever created by man.Chris Klein in every film he has been in manages to make it look as if
he has no range at all. His soft voice and good looks can only go so
far, and in a movie where you need to beat the living hell out of
another team member, you want someone that can at least yell and make a
sound beyond a bird chirp. LL Cool J is only hear to bring the film a
""cool"" hip look, he's suppose to be the I don't give a damn, James Dean
character, but it doesn't fly. Rebbeca Romijn, well, she has a nude
scene, but when it's covered in the dark, you wonder why she is even in
the movie to begin with.Rollerball is suppose to be a bloody entertaining film, but McTeirnan
at no point manages to show us anything entertaining. The entire game
sequences seem uninspired and drawn out. When it goes for a shock, it
misses and misses completely. I'm still wondering if LL Cool J's
character is dead or alive, but apparently it's not important to the
story. LL Cool J probably knew that this was going to be garbage and
left the movie, leaving the film crew to make his character disappear.
I don't blame him.Not even the professional himself, Jean Reno save this film from the
ultimate horrible experience that we all will endure from seeing this
film. In a film about violence in sports, you would expect to see some,
but when you have a PG-13 rating, you know that it was targeted to make
money and nothing else.I can't understand why someone would want to see this film, the final
action sequence is yet another let-down in this horrible tripe. The

a lot of black characters where being brutalised, without any chance to

Brittany Murphy does a good job at playing the ""confused"" grown-up,

1218,13.25,6.3,"""Betrayed"" is loosely based on the real life murder of a left-wing
radio personality by the name of Alan Berg by a white supremacist group
called The Order headed by a guy named Robert Mathews. The actual
murder happened sometime in the 80s (I believe). In the film Debra
Winger is an FBI agent sent undercover to a farming community in rural
Illinois to find out information about a possible suspect (Tom
Berenger) when a Chicago radio personality is killed.I've watched this film a number of times over the years. Something
keeps pulling me back to it. As someone else mentioned, there are
moments that really burn their way into your memory. I can't believe
somebody else commented on it, but there is a moment after Tom
Berenger's family horse is ""put down"" and as Bergener and a young Ted
Levine are leaving the barn in the rain we see Levine wrapped in
plastic holding the gun he used to shoot the horse and walking slightly
behind Berenger. For some reason, I've always found the image haunting.
Someone else said the image of Levine signifies the devil, which
certainly makes sense.Another moment is when Winger and Berenger are watching through a
window as the combine girls leave the motel and the entire scene is
played out with the camera outside, and something is blocking the lower
part of Berenger's face, so all we see throughout the scene are his
eyes. And Winger says, ""I don't like people getting hurt"". And Berenger
says ""They aren't people. They're mud people."" Something about it is
very disturbing and strange.The racial tirades in the film are quite jarring, too. Especially when
the kids say them. The ugliness and hatred of the words contrasts so
sharply with the obvious innocence of the children. We see so clearly
that the children are not inherently bad, and are simply being taught
hatred, as someone would teach a child the alphabet.The hunting scene, as almost every reviewer has mentioned, is very
disturbing, and is clearly meant to be disturbing. I still have trouble
watching it.I do think this is an important film, however. Most films depict the
Aryan nation and similar groups as quite simply evil, without offering
any kind of logic or shape to what they are about. Betrayed is a film
that actually dares to show them as real people. The character of
Shorty, played by John Mahoney is a brilliant creation and his campfire
speech to Debra Winger, explaining his motivation for behaving like he
does, is extremely important for anyone who wants to learn why some
people would join a radical group.Incidentally, there is also a (very disturbing) play entitled ""God's
Country"" that is about the Alan Berg murder and Robert Mathews. And the
Oliver Stone film ""Talk Radio"" is loosely based on Alan Berg's life and
murder.",127,1988

is dishonest, more violent as a national hate-film. Many hearts were
broken in Turkey"" due to this film. Although the film is set largely in
Turkey, most of the location work was done in Malta, using local actors
along with some Greeks and Armenians playing Turks. At some occasions

Maltese. Moreover most of the supposedly Turkish dialogs are so
inarticulate that they cannot be understood even by natives. Throughout
the whole film, Turks figure as brutes, militarists, bloodthirsty,
stupid and evil torturers and sadistic, in brief as true ""bastards"".
Their image is a real caricature: ugly, with a mustache, badly shaved,
suntanned, with eyes and hair very dark. They are stereotypical
persons, who, even when they are killed in the film, they always have
the lot they deserve! In an interview in 1984 producer David Puttnam

presented in the movie is a very exaggerated and fictional version of
what happened to him in the prison in Istanbul, Turkey.Finally, after 25 years, Oliver Stone has apologized to Turkey for this
film in 2004 when he visited Turkey. He admitted that he did not do any

details or character introductions, it makes things much more fun.The animation is generally better than it was in the TV series. Add to

1221,8.5,7.9,"Although Kes was not Loach's first film (he had made ""Cathy come home"" for
television and ""Poor Cow"") it is probably his best both artistically and
historically.
Historically, the film is an important one, because it's the first one
that
gives an accurate description of a working-class environment. There had
been
several social realist movies made before it, such as Karel Reisz's
""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"" or Tony Richardson's ""Billy Liar"", but
Kes set a whole new agenda.
Esthetically, Loach went a lot further than those before him, filming his
characters in a quasi-documentary way. Also, the actors were, for a great
part, non-professionals, which lent a further ""realistic"" touch to the
film.
For the first time, strong regional accents (Yorkshire) were allowed to

at
all demonstrative or heavy, the film is the most powerful indictment of
the
british class system that has ever been recorded on film.Billy Casper, the hero, is shown to have absolutely no chance of escaping
his harsh milieu. At home, his half-brother bullies him and he finds no
comfort from his mother. At school the behaviour of teachers,
career-councillors and headmasters ranges from violent to merely
condescending.
It's this anti-institutional side to the film that makes it so powerful.
Billy basically knows that he'll probably end up down the mine and he
knows
that school isn't there for his pleasure or his fulfillment but to tell
him
what to do.
So, unable to express himself at home or at school, Billy develops a
passion

1222,6.75,7.0,"A few months ago, while awaiting my late-night food at *that* deli in
Hollywood, I went up to a seated Rodney Bingenheimer and told him
straight up: ""'Mayor of the Sunset Strip' is one of the most important
films I've ever seen."" Emphasis on the word ""important"". I then
explained why, and he just smiled, closed his eyes and nodded.Less an indulgence in the overplayed phenomenon of ""celebrity"", this
film is much more of a (rare) viewing of notoriety's seedy, cultist
aspects under modern capitalism. In an age when ""fame"" and ""celebrity""
are their own forms of hard currency (E.G. invite a known celebrity to
YOUR party -- whatever the occasion -- and see how many people RSVP
within a matter of hours...), this is a film worth studying. The
Yale-educated director, who not ironically directed ""Hearts of
Darkness"", shrewdly turns the subject of Rodney Bingenheimer's literal
'staying power' in Hollywood into an entertaining and thought-provoking
look at FAME AS A DISEASE. When the film is viewed under this poignant
and increasingly relevant context, then Rodney really isn't that
different from anyone else in America (or hyper-consuming Western
culture in general). Nope, no one ultimately cares that you ran into
Paul McCartney once in your twenties, but you'll keep mentioning it
anyway...because you *matter*!!!I watched the film on DVD (the preferred format, considering the
variety of interviews in the ""extras"" portion) again after a yearlong
lapse from my first viewing, only to further absorb its potency on the
above-mentioned. A telling and strangely comforting aspect shown is the
palpable discomfort on the faces of certain demonstrably lifelong
insecure hyper-celebrities (Cher, Brooke Shields, Liam from Oasis) over
talking about Rodney, their mercurial lives and ultimately, how they
view ""fame"". One senses that, even if after attaining that much
""acceptance"", that you're still not comfortable in your own skin, then
it's best not to carry as much celebrity currency in your pockets in
the first place when - God Forbid -- you'd have to ever pay some of it
back to those who've helped you attain it along the way.Not all of the film's included luminaries came across in such fashion,
however -- Ray Manzerick, Gwen Stefani, Nancy Sinatra, Elvis Costello,
Brian Wilson and David Bowie more or less stayed clear of such forced
sincerity (read: barely contained cringing) in this film. And yet, I'd
be lying if I said that all of the awkward celebrity posturing wasn't
the most entertaining aspect of the film  yes, even more so then
simply the presence of the celebs who appear.Brooke Shield's interview in the DVD is akin to an actual cognitive
behavioral therapy session, where she relates how she's (supposedly)
overcome her past nagging needs for acceptance. This caveat is telling,
considering her much publicized postpartum depression (E.G. newborns
don't know how to adore ""celebrity"" on cue, hence potentially
magnifying the neuroses of past rejections felt by such otherwise
""me-first"" celebrities during, say, all-night baby crying sessions).Author and 'fame expert' Leo Braudy is featured briefly commenting on
the nature of fame and the public's obsession with it, concluding that
he doesn't know who Rodney Bingenheimer is. I would've rather included
authors Richard Schickel or Tyler Cowen (the latter an economist), who
would've provided better insights without the added flippancy.
Ironically (or maybe not so, considering the difference between having
BEEN in the fame trenches versus simply writing about them), Rodney's
darker trenches mate and alter-ego Kim Fowley actually sums up fame
better than does Braudy with a nutshell synopsis of what drives people
to seek fame, or the famous. Fowley accurately diagnoses Rodney and
everyone else in Hollywood -- in itself worth watching the movie for,
especially because Fowley illustrates the wacky, surreal and even
palpably evil accumulation of frothy on-the-edges-of-fame excess that
isn't limited to just the non-Wilshire Blvd. (read: corporate)
entertainment industry, but sums up fame's very heart and that
industry's core.The film also shrewdly (and deservedly) shines a subtly dismissive
light onto ""alternative radio"" juggernaut, KROQ, which is now to
'cutting edge' and 'fidelity to founding visionaries' what Alice Cooper
was to 'subtlety'. KROQ DJ Jed the Fish's summing up of KROQ's
essential value of Rodney Bingenheimer as more or less irrelevant to
modern musical trends is tactically contrasted by the director with a
brief yet accurate portrayal of KROQ's core current audience -- sweaty,
tattooed, violent, soul-less subhuman Huns who urinate openly at
concerts and grunt to hackneyed noise passing as their distressingly
elected life anthems.The viewer stumbles upon something: Being that ""fame"" has created its
own marketplace, it's obvious that Rodney has a unique talent that can
be shopped around (to Indy 103.1 or satellite radio, for
instance)...away from a midnight to 3:00 AM slot on KROQ. Yet, because
of the uniquely demonic characteristics of cut-throat, increasingly
commercial yet still elusive Hollywood, one then realizes possibly why
the less opportunistic 'good souls' (to quote Starsailor) like Rodney
don't have agents shopping their said talents around: Despite not
retaining any known instrumental or singing talents, a ""radio-friendly
voice"" (Jed the Fish? Swedish Eagle? Adam Corolla?!?) or Teutonic good
looks, still, at least Rodney is not a hack.I'd make this film required viewing in suburban high schools as well as
in college courses involving media or cultural studies, sociology,
psychology, the arts and/or the humanities. Best to cork that genie in
our tortured youth before 'groupie-dom' tries to compensate for their
disturbingly growing lack of self-esteem...With that said, God Bless Rodney Bingenheimer.",94,2003

with the remake because it went completely over the top. But here
Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) is back under another name. Being in
therapy with a group who all were involved in rape she slowly turns
back into her bad habits, going out to kill the rapists. It takes a while before she goes berserk and you will see the best,
read gory, parts of the 2010 version. When her new girlfriend is being
killed by her ex-boyfriend it's time to search the guys responsible.
The first kill is the one you will remember the most because she goes
for a blow but not with a happy ending for the guy. From there on it's
a bit of the same as in the 2010 version. Except that we do have a
little message hidden throughout the movie itself. The victims aren't
the ones being helped by the authorities. It's so weird to see Sarah turning into a sickie, especially towards
the end when she thinks all men are the same, have been talking to her
and in fact have seen her again the day before I watched this flick at
a convention. Does this flick offer anything towards the franchise, to be honest it
doesn't but t is still worth picking up. Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 25/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",92,2015

quite well as a comedy.In fact, Eskimo Nell is a strange kind of self-spoof, not only spoofing the
sex film genre as such but even its own making - the kind of self-reference
Douglas Hofstadter would appreciate. Viewers may be inclined to think that
the ""self-spoof"" is faked, but there are persistent rumours that many of the

very closely based on fact.",85,1975

just as good, if not better. To be fair, while the gunfights in here were well done, the fistfights
were an insult. Whenever someone got slugged, such as Wayne belting his
kids, it had no effect on them, except just to knock them down for a
second or two. In real life, folks, chances are you will knocked
unconscious if you are hit in the face, especially by a powerful man
like Wayne. This has been a ludicrous fact-of-life, however, in all
films for 100 years, not just here.Other than that, the film is a straight hard-nosed one with Wayne and
adversary Richard Boone both fascinating. The dialog between the two
was especially fun to hear. Too bad there wasn't more of it. Boone did
not have enough lines in this film. Wayne's real-life sons in this film
didn't impress me with their acting but they weren't horrible either.Bruce Cabot was a hoot as an old Indian friend of Wayne's. As with most

even one of the top 20 best Danny De Vito films (isn't this little guy one
of the biggest comic actors of our time!) but it's a nice comedy, good to
rent on video or watch on TV.Basically the plot is not very imaginative and the movie relies mostly on
the actors performances. So I'll concentrate on them in this review. Here it
goes:De Vito is perfect as always. Noone could play the part of the complacent
billionaire better than him! He does the best he can do with the material
he's given, but his talent could have been used more appropriately if the
writers had done a better job...Martin Lawrence also playes one of his usual parts, quite similar to the
part he played in Blue Streak. He does everything expected from him,
including getting in disguise more than once and producing some Eddie
Murphy-style jokes. But seeing Black Knight and now this, one may ask: isn't
he repeating himself too much now? Sure he's funny, but he's also getting
annoying to more and more people...We also have some good-loking actresses, especially the lady playing
Lawrence's girlfriend. Their parts are unfortunately too brief to be
memorable.Oh,yes, there's also William Fichtner playing one of the weirdest detectives
in the history of cinema! Am I the only one who thinks he was doing a parody
of Willem Defoe's character in The Boondock Saints??As far as the plot, well, it's all about a ring...",94,2001
1228,7.5,4.3,"Anna Walton has one of those faces. She seems to crop up in all sorts
of productions, but it was a while before I realised she was Luke
Goss's albino sister in 'Hellboy 2 (2008)'. Here, she plays Sissy, a
sports teacher at Faith's (Naomi Battrick) school.Faith is a stunning fifteen year old virgin, casually bullied by her
school friends. Her father is dying. Sissy, who has been observing her,
has a deal to make  The characters are well defined. Although
defensive, Faith is a likable character, and as her predicament becomes
more pronounced, we fear for what she's getting herself into. Equally,
Sissy becomes less easy to trust the more embroiled she becomes in the
lives of Faith and her father.The pace of the film is frenetic. Faith's makes a remarkable
(impossibly quick) recovery from her various ordeals before embarking
on avenging herself against the formidable coven of occultists  but
then, when so many events are influenced by the supernatural, who is to
say that she cannot defy all obstacles at such a lick? If you can get
past that implausibility, it is easy to get caught up in the quick-fire
revelations and development  there is a lot to be lost allowing the
attention to wander.With such an attractive cast, there is little excuse for drifting.
That, alongside some generous amount of carnage, make this a very
enjoyable roller-coaster. The ending, which I think intends us not to
take anything too seriously, is either a huge jump shock, or hilarious,
depending on your point of view.",85,2015
1229,11.4,8.0,"What an absolute waste of 2.5 hours.It didn't look like it was going to be my type of film, but the trailer
was very convincing, not to mention the plethora of award nominations
it has received, so I decided to give it a go.Mistake.It started with a collection of superb actors, delivering solid
performances. Despite what I've read, I thought Tom Hardy's accent was
spot on - that is what that accent sounds like! Domhnall Gleeson is in
everything these days, for good reason, and Will Poulter was certainly
endearing. Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent, dragging oneself through
the snow post-bear mauling should be pretty torturous, and as we know
from Wolf of Wall Street's infamous 'Ludes' scene, DiCaprio is a pro at
crawling and grunting.A cast such as this should have delivered an outstanding movie, so I
can only assume something went catastrophically wrong with the script.
Because my God was it BORING.There was absolutely zero character development. If you're going to
produce something that is on the long side, at least give me something
to work with here? The son was killed so early (and following so few
lines) I genuinely didn't care, which didn't help to lay a foundation
for why I should care about Glass's prolonged revenge mission. As well as the characters being entirely 2D, they also quickly became
parodies of themselves. ""The Revenant Presents: Domhnall Gleeson as the
Principled Yet Naive Captain (who must die as punishment for his
ineptitude); Tom Hardy as the Southern Villain (with no redeeming
features, who likewise must die to maintain the idea of a Just World);
Will Poulter as the Impressionable Young Soldier-type and Leonardo
DiCaprio as the Tortured Hero. Don't forget the Arrogant French
Braggarts, and the Wise Yet Ruthless Indigenous People. Oh and Tom
Hardy's Random Cockney Friend.""While I still think Hardy's accent was well executed, the choice to use
an accent which is often a source of ridicule (I'm not endorsing that
view) only served to undermine the tension rather than build it, making
him seem like a fool rather than a dangerous adversary. Admittedly, he
did a kill a number of people so maybe playing The Fool was his way of
lulling everyone into a false sense of security.DiCaprio was convincing in his role of the Aggrieved Father avenging
the death of his son, but his journey of adversity quickly became
absurd rather than laudable. The bear attack was BRUTAL, and as his
company quickly concluded, it seems unlikely he would have survived his
injuries, particularly when being carted around in the depth of winter. But no, not only does he survive, he also survives Hardy's attempt to
smother him, and being dragged into a partial burial, as well as
witnessing the murder of his son (which would be enough to render any
of us catatonic). OK, this might be plausible, maybe.Then he wanders around for a bit, spurred on by the prospect of
vengeance, before being nearly drowned in a river. Again, the trip down
the rapids would have been enough to drown the average man, let alone
someone who has just suffered a savage bear attack followed by an
attempted smothering. But no, he comes to a gentle stop at the river
bank and has a nap - mysteriously without succumbing to hypothermia.Cue more wandering, some assistance from a kindly fellow wanderer, and
yet more wandering.As if three potential deaths weren't enough (four if you account for
the bear effectively attacking him twice), he's then under attack by
the very people who's daughter he's just rescued, and not only does he
not get shot (despite these people having been shown to be
frighteningly accurate), his horse RIDES HIM OFF A CLIFF and surprise,
surprise - HE LIVES! In fact, he doesn't just survive it, he guts the
dead horse and SLEEPS INSIDE IT. *Beats chest asserting manliness*By the end I was desperate for one of them to just kill the other so I
could go home. Tom Hardy finally met his maker - not before uttering
the obligatory moral message that revenge doesn't make us feel better.The Revenant is a classic case of style over substance. Fantastic
actors, slipping effortlessly into a range of clichéd characters,
stunning cinematography, and zero emotion. I'm a crier, I will cry at
the majority of films and TV shows (and occasionally books), so the
fact that I not only didn't cry, but felt absolutely nothing towards
any of the characters, says it all.It's clearly a polarising piece of work, I've seen many other reviews
here that echo my sentiments, yet my boyfriend loved it, and the
average rating is currently 8.3! Unfortunately, Award Land appears to
be siding with my other half. This year's Oscar Best Picture category
is a crowded race with several worthy contenders - but the Revenant is
not one, and I really hope it doesn't win.Does DiCaprio deserve the nomination? He was one of the better things
in this film, and playing such a role must have pushed him to his
physical limits, so maybe he does. Frankly, he's massively overdue one
so for God's sake just give the man an Oscar and let's forget this
absurd study in masculine pride ever existed.",156,2015

middle of events enormously bigger than them.There are no heroes here, only experience. No guilt, just sorrow. No

this movie. My expectations were realistic. Puns, slapstick humor, and
generally sophomoric humor are fine by me. These parodies don't take
themselves too seriously, and neither do I. The wife and I went to the
theater expecting some lighthearted fun. But, what we saw was anything
but fun or funny.This film's attempts to parody the plot of Fifty Shades of Grey were
overshadowed by the stilted dialogue, lame sight gags, and ineffectual
attempts to get a rise out of the audience with tired racial
stereotyping and racist humor. Sexual humor was expected. But I did
expect some of it to be funny. It wasn't. Most of the gags in the film
were greeted by dead silence in the theater and blank stares at the
screen by my fellow theater goers.We talked about walking out of the movie after the first scene, and
every scene after that until we finally did walk out 20 minutes into
the movie.Maybe there was a funny joke in that movie later on, but I am sure I
will not be giving this movie a second chance. It is one of the worst

1233,4.5,6.8,"Although Flashbacks of a Fool is Daniel Craig's pet project  he's the
film's executive producer as well as its star  it actually contains
surprisingly little of the blonde hunk (though for the ladies out
there, you do, admittedly, get to see his bum).Craig plays Joe Scott, a movie star who has plenty of money and sexual
satisfaction in his life, one which - when he is not indulging in
coke-addled rumpy pumpy at least - is mostly spent looking out to the
sea from his minimalist cliff-top pad.Yet he has no real friends and seemingly no real future  ""there's no
role for you ANYWHERE,"" his agent tells Joe, a moment after he has seen
his client throw his prized mobile phone out of a restaurant window.As Joe begins to wonder what has happened to his life, we are taken
back to his adolescent days of first love on the quiet English seaside,
to discover what this Brit has in fact been trying to hide from with a
life of debauchery and excess in LA.Even a fan of this film should be able see why some might find it slow
and slightly dull, as it does rely on the viewer sharing in a sense of
glory in the mystical power of great records, the tragic romance of
nostalgia and regret, and the theme of washed-up stardom.Perhaps that provides limited scope for the film to garner a wide
audience, but for those who can find true enjoyment from subtle
portrayals of youth and humanity as much as from the more obvious
merits of rapid plot progression that will matter little. The direction
is superb, the script never feels rushed, and the wistful tone of
someone looking back to their yesterdays to get on with their today is
rare in its realisation of artistic vision.There's no big finale, but that's not to say that the conclusion is
anything less than perfect in its mood and its timing. A literate film
that is there to relish on a quiet afternoon, Flashbacks of a Fool
feels more typical of a book by Ian McEwan (though thankfully it bears
little in common to the cinematic version of Atonement) than a film
starring the current Bond. It could also have you listening to Roxy
Music for the rest of your weekend, even if you've never before had the
urge to sing along to Bryan Ferry in the bath - a pleasing added bonus.There is nothing foolish about this film  watch it accordingly.",109,2008

been so invested in her husband as the center of her universe that when
she tragically loses him, she turns to his best friend (who she has
hated for years) to keep from losing her connection to her husband. In
the course of events, she discovers the redeeming qualities her husband
had always seen in him.Del Torro gives a poignant performance of a drug addict who struggles
to change his life after the loss of his best friend - with quiet
dignity. A must see at least once. Although the movie is long, I can't
imagine cutting one moment of this powerful story. Cinematically it's
superb.Everyone who knows anyone who has struggled with addiction will be

exciting as the first film. Fans looking for more of the amazing David
Belle and the stunts of parkour will find these elements lacking in the
sequel. B-13 had a simple plot and explosive action sequences that
still hold up well today. New director this time around and the crisp
compositions and editing of the original are replaced with more uses of
the hand-held cam, to less successful results. If you liked the opening
camera-work in B13 -- you get a lot more of it here as the camera
swooshes around the blocks of District 13 introducing the major players
in the film. Fortunatly, the chemistry of Belle and Raffaelli is still
strong, but they just don't have enough to do together in this plot.
Speaking of plot, I would dare say that this sequel has too much plot
and side characters. Belle seems like a supporting player in his own
film. Now to be fair, there are a couple of good sequences that spark
the original vibe of B-13, but sadly, they are few and far between. I
had high hopes going into this one, but was let down overall. Let's

all
the way thru without the colorization on TV. It is a truly awesome movie.Comparing the two is not really fare or easy as Carpenter's version has
the
benefits of modern movie magic. But that is in my opinion the only place
it
excels. It seems in the remake all the characters are derelicts and for
the
most part not very likeable. In the original you had a sense of these
people
liking each other and sticking together.Kenneth Tobey is a very good and believable leader of his men. He also
shows
a very human side in that he realizes he is not the smartest of men. He
is
what he is. A captain of a small band of Air Force Soldiiers simply doing
their job.Robert Cornblaithe is excellent as Dr. Carrington. He comes of snootish
yet
still likeable enough because you can see that deep down he really
admires
Captain Hendry (Tobey) though he can't see eye to eye with him on their
situation or dealing of his ""Thing From Another world.""Every character in the movie is well played. They all look like they
belong
in their roles. Their look and attire fit their characters and when one
guy
is called Professor so and so or whomever, you believe it unlike many
movies

There
is one thing though, Margaret Sheridan's pants pulled up almost to her
neck
line (exaggeration...but close) I could have done without. I realize it
was
a style of the times but I think they could have given her something a
little better to show off her figure when you first meet her. Especially
since she was the only female love interest and was tagged as ""a pinup
girl""
in earlier scenes. She looks better when her hair is down and she is in
different clothes. I know that is being picky but I just had to say
it.The creature is better presented in the original as far as being
frightening. You hardly ever see him. When you do it's only for brief
periods at a time and usually in the dark. That frightening sound of ""The
Thing"" is very original in that it's not just a growl but sounds like a
cat
meowing at times. Very eerie!The story is well known and both are similiar although I must admit the
remake is closer to the actual Campbell JR.'s short tale. But the
original
still gives it a good account and in many ways surpasses the short story
because it is easier to identify with the creature since he's
humanoid.It boils down to suspense, drama and mood versus gore, F/X, and fast
paced
action. Both movies are top notch. I am proud to own both and would not
try
and say one is overtly better than the other. The remake has the benefits
of
the then modern movie technology. The original had the benefit of black
and
white to add to the suspense and utter danger they are in. The choice is
yours. I myself enjoy the original a little more as it holds up today

Grassic Gibbon, are brought to life. It is said that nothing but the
land endures, yet there is something about each of these characters 
good and bad - that endures too. Intriguing characters include a
sensual, pretty and bright young woman who loves the landscape and
dreams of a better life, a strict and abusive farm family patriarch in
desperate need of an intervention and anger management classes, and a
young man turned bitter and cowardly by war and violence. The story is
told mostly through the eyes of the young woman, Chris, as she grows
and experiences hardships as well as bliss. It is amazing to witness
her transformations through the people she comes in contact with, the
land and the emotions she feels. Kindness, love, nature and light
endure when we let them. Anger, violence and hatred make them the
lovelier for that.The director is obviously extremely experienced and capable at such
historic United Kingdom stories. He invigorates the senses in sight and
sound, and we even almost feel the emotions of the characters and smell
the hay, mist and mud. I suppose this is the ""memory realism"" style I
read about. Remarkably, and appropriately to the themes of the story,
Davies does not shy away from the rawness of anger, sex, nudity and
violence. He is equally adept at bringing out the beauty of the story
as well as its darkness. There is exemplary acting here especially by
the leads, yet with the exception of the one who played Ewan (each of
his moods seemed the same to me). For those few who can differentiate

director that wanted to make a good movie, actors that were happy to
play their role, all of these resulting into a good B horror.It has some elements from ""Contracted"", some from ""Freakdog"" or maybe
""The crow"", anyway it was a fun ride, especially that they decided to
limit the torture screen of the girl and show more of her vengeance.
Maybe it lasted a tad bit more than it should have, but probably wanted
to offer some deepness to it all.So all in all, ""Savaged"" is an OK movie for many horror fans out there,

Maguire, is born and raised in an orphanage. He is taught the ways of
childbirth and abortion by the headmaster, Dr. Larch, played by Michael
Caine. The young boy wants to be more useful in life and goes on his own way
to end up working in an apple orchard and learning about lobster
fishing.The Maguire boy/man character fights with his own morals and lack of
worldliness as the movie progresses. The predictable ending probably
couldn't have been any better. Life happens. Bad things often happen to good
people. This movie does question your thoughts of humanity.I found raw emotion, humor and tenderness in this movie. The story is set in
Maine; but actually filmed in Vermont and Connecticut too. Scenery is
awesome. Maguire's timid, monotone character does take some getting used to.
Caine was very good. Charlize Theron proved that not only is she beautiful,
but she can act as well. Erykah Badu did extremely well in a small, but
important role. This movie is worthy of its many Oscar nominations.",126,1999

Chinese anti-defamation organizations as being a very racist film. The
film
was likewise given lot of bad reviews by critics, who probably wanted to
be
politically correct.Being a Chinese American who was raised in Boston's Chinatown, I had
expected bad things about this film. Even though ""The Deer Hunter"" is a
great film, the depictions of Vietnamese and Chinese in that film are
truly
horrendous (no, Chinese DID NOT engage in Russian Roulette!!) I expected
the same with ""Year of the Dragon."" I was totally shocked after I saw the
film at how realistic the film was about Chinatown. I do understand many
Chinese Americans do not want themselves portrayed as drug dealers, gang
members, etc. However, I don't think there has been any film in Hollywood
history who portrayed the dark side of Chinatown as accurately as this
film.
I know because I grew up in the area when there lot of Chinese street
gangs
and mafia activity.The sad thing is after this film was released, depictions of Chinese
Americans has gotten a LOT worse; they are depicted as chopsocky kung fu
gangsters (now isn't that ironic!!) in Jet Li and Jackie Chan movies, or
as
baby killers, rapists, or domineering bigots in ""The Joy Luck Club"" (by
the
way, this film is truly truly AWFUL in it's portrayals of Chinese; the
ignorant critics however gave this movie great reviews.) Strangely,
Chinese
anti-defamation leagues has been very silent during these
years.""Year of the Dragon"" is Cimino's unappreciated gem. According to my view,
it's his second best film. I understand this film has flaws but Cimino
was
brilliant in showing the side of Chinese Americans that few Americans
know.

1253,5.0,6.2,"Even if I disliked Thin Ice, I'd still have major sympathy for
co-writer/director Jill Sprecher, who seemed to have went through hell
and high water just to get this film a release. Thin Ice was originally
released to Sundance under the name ""The Convincer,"" in a one-hundred
and fourteen minute cut that received strong reception from audiences
and critics. However, the studio that purchased the film insisted that
the score be redundant, the editing reworked, and the pace of the film
increased, making the picture ninety-three minutes instead of
one-hundred and fourteen. Sprecher, obviously embarrassed and
frustrated, has basically given up on Thin Ice and likely looks at it
as a sore spot on her career.That note alone should make one hesitate before publishing something
negative about the film. It makes me consider my position as an online
film critic deeper, too. Here I am, a viewer of many movies a year
(last year almost five-hundred) by choice, and I don't always take into
account the effort it takes to make a picture and the stress that
numerous people likely go under. Thin Ice is a perfect example of a
film I hesitate to review because I feel as if I have not seen the real
thing. The ninety-three minute cut has received mixed reception,
contrary to the original films near-acclaim.Regardless, I find Thin Ice - in and of itself - a solid crime caper.
The story centers around Mickey Prohaska (Greg Kinnear), a third rate
insurance salesman in a dire financial predicament, looking to invest
in something that will increase his reliability, win back his wife, and
get him out of the frigid, merciless conditions the Wisconsin cold has
brought him. He teams up with another man to try and sell Gorvy Hauer
(Alan Arkin), an elderly, senile farmer, insurance despite knowing the
man doesn't have much money at all. When Mickey discovers he has an
expensive-looking violin, he has it appraised only to realize it is
slightly rare and valued at $25,000.This seems all well and good until Randy Kinney (Billy Crudup), a local
con-man with an unstable temper, discovers Mickey's plans and, in the
process, kills one of Gorvy's neighbors. Now, in an effort to save his
own skin, Mickey must work with Randy to cover up the murder, while
trying to turn a profit from Gorvy, and sneakily sell his violin for
what soon becomes an unruly amount of money.One film that will cross nearly every mind that watches this film is
Fargo, the Coen brothers classic. The entire picture seems like a spin
off of the film, from the similar plotpoints to the locational weather
to the darkly funny direction the film takes. Despite this, Sprecher
and her sister Karen do a bold job of making this film stand on its
own, simply because of the way events are piled on each other in a
rapid-fire order and how the twist is tacked on at the end.The acting, however, is the film's strongest feature, with Kinnear,
Crudup, and Arkin being on top of their game in terms of convincing
performances. Kinnear is a great everyman, but he has a way about
playing a man who has a bigger, brasher internal view of himself in
contrast to the way he actually appears. This kind of character's
mannerisms are seen in the wonderful Little Miss Sunshine, where he
played a father hellbent on selling success advice in a cheap
twelve-step book. Here, he plays a deadbeat husband hellbent on selling
insurance in a cheaply wrapped package and achieves the same level of
success.Meanwhile, Crudup's character is a tricky one to pull off. He is a
character that requires the actor playing him to go from collective to
explosive in a matter of seconds akin to a time-bomb. This works
tremendously in contrast to Kinnear's ""gotta keep everything subtle and
cool"" persona. Finally, it should come as no surprise Arkin is great
here, but the role is made more special because it shows Arkin as
something he rarely is - gullible.Ultimately, there are issues in Thin Ice that need to be addressed. The
pacing is a bit too fast and the opening is a tad sluggish when it
should look to grab our attention. However, these are issues that I am
almost certain wouldn't exist if the original cut had been released
like it should've been. The product we are left with is pretty solid
and an easy thing to recommend, but the entire thing almost feels like
a cliffhanger that has no writer to complete it.Starring: Greg Kinnear, Billy Crudup, and Alan Arkin. Directed by: Jill

1254,11.5,5.5,"One of my all-time favourite music scores is Elmer Bernstein's thrilling
theme from 'The Magnificent Seven'. I was practically dancing in my seat
when I got to hear it again during the opening sequence in 'Return Of The
Seven', the first of 3 sequels to John Sturges' classic western. My
enthusiasm was short-lived. Bernstein and star Yul Brynner are the only
major players to return for this 1966 rehashing of the first picture. Their
work is solid---even though they just do the same things they did in
Sturges' film---but writer Larry Cohen and director Burt Kennedy don't have
any new ideas of their own.It's impossible to replace actors like Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach, James
Coburn, and Charles Bronson with Warren Oates, Fernando Rey and a slew of
unknowns, but that must have been the best they could do. It's just as
foolish to remake the remake (let's not forget that 'Magnificent' was a redo
of Kurosawa's 'The Seven Samurai'). A completely different story might have
worked better. Since only 3 of the original 7 survived---and neither McQueen
or Horst Buchholz return as Vin or Chico)---you can't help noticing that the
B team is just not good enough to match what the A team did with Brynner in
1960.So brace yourself as Chris Adams (Brynner) and company ride into battle
against Mexican bandits all over again. This time they've got to save Chico
and the other male villagers they saved years before. Same result? Not
telling, but there are 1 or 2 fun moments along the way. Any excuse to hear
Bernstein's music is a good excuse, especially when the movie is on free TV.
All the same, I think I'll skip the other sequels. 'Return Of The Seven'
isn't horsepoo, but it's certainly not worthy of riding with 'The
Magnificent Seven' either.",95,1966

sure it is a far better and more complex story to be found there, which
didn't translate to the screen.Apart from the pacing and a story twist that will leave with a bad
feeling (again, I don't know if it's the same in the novel), what

not saying bad, just dull. It's exactly about sympathizing with them,

1258,9.75,6.3,"Film noir is one of the oldest and most worked of all the Hollywood genres.
Starting as early as 1941 with John Huston's The Maltese Falcon. Other
greats include Orson Welles's Touch of Evil and Hitchcock's Notorious. With
such a great variety of so-called ""classic"" noires to see, why would one
want to take the time and money to watch an independent film noir by a then
unknown director/writer. Simple: the director/writer is John Dahl, and this
is no ordinary film noir. In fact, his movies (this was the first of them
all) are so well received that critics credit him with starting a new genre
called neo-noir.It starts out like any other noir. Fay Forrester (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer),
the femme fatal, and her boyfriend (Michael Madsen) are some small time
criminals who rob the mod. They steal a briefcase full of money and kill
one of the mod members. Then, Fay, who longs to escape country life and
move to Las Vegas hits her husband on the head with a rock, takes all the
money for herself, and runs to Vegas. Once she gets to Vegas, she hires
Jack Andrews (Val Kilmer) to make it look like she was murdered, offering
him, ""$5000 up front and $5000 when I'm dead."" Jack, reluctantly takes
the job. However, once the job is done, Fay skips out of town without
paying Jack the final $5000, and to make matters worse, Fay's boyfriend is
in town at Jack's office looking for Fay. Now this is where it gets really
interesting because everyone is looking to kill everyone else for revenge.
It is just a question of who will succeed. The last half of the movie is
filled with plot twists and unexpected actions. This, and especially the
end, is where this film deviates from what is usually called film noir.
This is not to say that the twists are unmotivated or out of character.
They very much are. It is just the types of twists and the number of them
are uncommon for films preceding this time. The ending is unexpected and
pleasurable. But I
won't ruin it for you here.One thing that is particularly true for this movie is the consistency found
in each of the main characters. There is no scene that feels out of place
within the context of the picture. Also, I have to give a thumbs up to the
under-appreciated performance by Michael Madsen. He does one heck of a job
as the psycho boyfriend. Another thing that must be mentioned is the great
choices for the camera angles by John Dahl. This makes the movie better
than it is or should be. He places the camera in places so that you feel
either closer or farther from the action, depending upon what sense he is
trying to convey to the viewer. He really makes the tension tenser, and the
action faster. The audience always gets enough, but never too much. This
is just an outstanding example of film directing. The only other directors
that have this uncanny ability are Welles, Hitchcock, Kubrick, Tarantino,
and Scorsese. In my opinion, this film (which is from 1989) is a major
influence on Tarantino and his works. You can clearly see the similarities
between their choice of camera angles and what the audience gets to see;
however, Tarantino is more graphic face.While this movie is far from perfect, it is quite good and deserves any true
noir fan's time and attention. If you like noires, and in particular, this
film, then go check out Dahl's other two good neo-noires: Redrock West and
The Last Seduction. I give this film an 8/10.",0,1989
1259,15.4,5.5,"Disturbing Behavior is a difficult film for a serious movie critic to
defend, primarily because of a long-standing prejudice to both the teen
and horror genres. Granted, few teen movies are designed to treat their
subjects with any degree of seriousness. And of all the film genres,
horror is kept alive with only the slightest bit of effort, accompanied
by even slighter expectations. But director David Nutter tackles both
these obstacles in a rare attempt to sophisticate Hollywood's offerings
to teen audiences and bring dignity to the maligned horror genre.
Despite a screenplay written contrary to his vision, Nutter succeeds in
creating a dramatic, moody, and entertaining sci-fi/horror yarn far
more difficult to dismiss than its contemporary equivalents. That is,
until MGM destroyed it.It's important to note that the version of Disturbing Behavior being
analyzed here is the director's cut, which is not the version released
in theaters. Nutter's cut isn't available commercially, but if you
watch the DVD's considerable amount of deleted footage and the original
ending, you can see just how devastating the studio's changes were. After suffering the loss of his older brother, Steve and his family
relocate to Cradle Bay, where some of the kids at school aren't quite
themselves these days. With the help of friends Rachel (Katie Holmes)
and Gavin (Nick Stahl), Steve discovers that a local doctor, Caldicott
(Bruce Greenwood), is conspiring with parents to lobotomize their teens
in order to create ""good boys and girls"", all of whom become members of
the school's Blue Ribbon elitist clique. Caldicott's experiments
prevent the Blue Ribbons from sexual impulses and mold them into
academic achievers that spend a great deal of their time trying to
recruit others to ""the program"". Unfortunately, the experiments don't
always work and trouble is at hand, especially when Steve's parents
sign him up.Scott Rosenberg, the screenwriter of the film, later expressed great
disappointment with Nutter's handling of the material. Rosenberg, the
screenwriter of Con-Air and Beautiful Girls, never intended his script
to be treated as dramatically or realistically as Nutter executed it.
Instead, it was supposed to be more ""hip"" and ""cool"", allegedly without
being mired down by characterization or atmosphere. This seems to
indicate that the screenwriter, like the studio executives, had low
ambitions with the material, planning to do nothing more than churn out
another cheap horror film that insults the intelligence of its target
audience. David Nutter, a veteran director of The X-Files, saw the potential in
Rosenberg's script and acted on it. He started by casting three of the
most talented young actors in Hollywood. James Marsden breaks the
stereotype that models can't be good actors by delivering a subtle,
restrained performance as Steve. Katie Holmes has a few opportunities
to demonstrate her abilities as well. As the socially outcast Rachel,
Holmes combines a defensive posture with an underlying desire to
connect. Nick Stahl has the meatiest part, playing the cynical Gavin, a
critic of all the other cliques at school. Gavin's quiet omnipotence is
colored by a dry sense of humor much needed in the film. Other notable
performances include William Sadler as Newberry, the school's janitor.
Newberry is a little off kilter, squinting, grumbling, and hell-bent on
ridding the world of all rats. Another interesting character who almost
steals the show is U.V. (Chad E. Donella), Gavin's reticent albino
friend who spends most of the film sitting at Gavin's side and uttering
only a few syllables. Nutter's style is very much the signature X-Files style, dark, steamy,
creepy, and purposeful. To achieve this, Nutter enlisted an X-Files
photographer (John S. Bartley), the X-Files composer (Mark Snow),
several X-Files actors (including Steve Railsback, aka Duane Barry),
and key production personnel. The result is a movie that feels like an
X-Files spin-off, with a subdued ambiance that washes over you and gets
under your skin. Nutter commissioned one of the more remarkable opening
title sequences in recent film history, one that serves as a cinematic
prelude to the lobotomy procedure later in the film - a rapidly-edited
montage of happy images and words designed to hypnotize and brainwash
Caldicott's victims. If Disturbing Behavior should be criticized, it certainly loses points
in its third act, one that falls dangerously close to cliché, with
Steve becoming more the archetypal hero figure in a predictable and
unimaginative showdown with Caldicott and the Blue Ribbons. Since the
third act of any story is largely plot (character development is
usually pretty well wrapped-up by then), I imagine Nutter had little to
work with from Rosenberg's original screenplay. That the first two acts
were so emotionally engaging is the result of Nutter's persistence and
better judgment. It's too bad that MGM freaked out after a test
screening in Texas and thought they could improve their numbers by
shortening the film and forcing it into the cookie-cutter shape of the
average, low-achieving horror flick. I champion this film because of its thematic content and its ideology.
Like many of my favorite films (RoboCop, Dances with Wolves, Rebel
Without a Cause), it deals with characters in crises of identity,
trying to become or remain whole, and connect with each other. Equally
interesting to me are the notions of sexual repression as a sign of
perfection, man playing God, parents' willingness to medically alter
their children, and human unwillingness to face loss. Nutter's bold
vision for this material, his ability to cull it from a screenplay
where it was not just dormant, but banished, makes his director's cut a
remarkable achievement. Add in the exemplary performances of Marsden,
Stahl, and Holmes, and that special X-Files flare, and I've got
something I can really sink my teeth into. - Scott Schirmer",84,1998

debonair charm of James Bond. Jonathan Hemlock possesses the same
cultural refinement and cosmopolitanism that the Bond character does.
In fact, Hemlock and Bond are at work and at home in the same element:
international espionage. I suspect this is why the casual fan of Clint Eastwood typically
detests this movie. Clint Eastwood appears to be miscast. But I'd say
he pulls it off admirably, showing the viewer a side of himself which
is rarely seen and exhibiting his versatility as an actor. The story itself is better than average and the movie rates two and one
half stars.",129,1975
1267,3.5,4.2,"What a load of garbage. I just wasted nearly two hours of my life
watching this junk. Not only was it low budget, it was low everything.
Low quality acting, characterisation, scripting and just about
everything else I can think of.How the heck this ever made it through to distribution I will never
know. My only other regret is that I have to give it at least 1 star,
whereas zero or even a negative would have been more appropriate. I can only assume this will languish in the video rental charts for a
while before finally disappearing without trace. It is without a doubt,
the worst movie ever made.",116,2016
1268,12.25,6.1,"Well back in the day when I was an impressionable teenager, I couldn't
even tell the difference between such things as fact or fiction. That
being said I always knew a pretty decent horror movie when I saw one.This little gem first caught my attention when I caught the trailer
prior to it's initial release, and much like many a movie with a decent
trailer I just knew that I had to see it.The trailer I saw courtesy of Entertainment in Video announced the
title as 'Hardcover' Of course I never realised that the movie was
actually called 'I Madman' which was the better title, and which
currently graces my MGM retail release which is sitting right by my
side as I write these very words.The 1980's were a good time for horror movies, and they were also a
good time for me when it came time for me discovering the many gems
that sprawled themselves across the videostore shelves, I still
remember hiring the likes of 'Pumpkinhead' 'Killer Klowns From Outer
Space' 'Retribution'.As with most movies that I liked and revered down through the years
there have been some that haven't quite stood the test of time,
'Society' springs to mind, that being said, certain elements of 'I
Madman' have always remained within my memory.Having just watched the movie prior to writing these words, it struck
me just how visually stunning the movie was and more importantly just
how good the script written by David Chaskin was.Filled with many a wonderful set piece, director Tibor Takacs really
knew what to do with the camera, and aided superbly by the acting
talent he had to work with, Jenny Wright as Virginia the bookstore
clerk who begins to find herself immersed within the hideous world of
the mad scribe Malcolm Brand, always had a very distinct acting style,
very distant but always alluring, a prime example of this was her star
turn in Eric Red's ultra cool 'Near Dark'.Also on hand and acquitting himself admirably was Clayton Rohner, (who
I'll always remember from Nigel Dick's 'P.I. Private Investigation')as
Virginia's detective boyfriend, who can't quite bring himself to
believe anything that Virginia's tells him, as he attributes her
flights of fancy to her taste in reading material written by the
villain of the piece Malcolm Brand.If truth be told one of the best performances in the movie comes from
Murray Rubin as Brand's publisher Sidney Zeit, the way he talks, his
mannerisms and the interior of his office just encapsulate that closed
in world of the low rent publisher.Kudos also must go to Randall William Cook, who not only does he appear
as the titular on screen villain, but he also doubled as the special
effects creator, truly rocks as the lovesick Brand, who'd do just about
anything for the love of his life(and if you haven't seen the movie,
just wait and see and wait for your jaw to drop when you see what he's
done to his facial features).Director Takacs might not have directed anything of note in the last
decade of so, but this movie along with the original 'The Gate' stand
as a testament to his directing talents and as for scriptwriter David
Chaskin, yes he might have been lambasted for his scripting of
'Nightmare On Elm Street 2' but through this movie he truly showed that
he really had an ear for good dialogue and attention to detail when it
came to setting a good gore laden set piece.It really is too bad that the MGM release doesn't have a director's
commentary attached to it, as it would have been nice to hear how the
movie was financed and put together.This movie would make a good companion piece with John Carpenter's 'In
The Mouth Of Madness' and as a stand alone feature, this horror movie
really delivers upon the promise of it's trailer and it's artwork
cover, plus it's a true testament to it's abilities to chill and
entertain twenty plus years later.Loose yourself in this great little horror curio tonight, you'll be
awful glad you did! Without hesitation, 10/10",89,1989
1269,8.2,7.9,"There's a telling moment near the beginning of Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon.""In closeup, we see the rough-hewn, heavy wooden wheels of a peasant cart.
They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway
entering a gated city. The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly
into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing
wagons...in
one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary
reality is fabricated to fit such traditions... The camera rises, we see
an
almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out
before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.What a film this is: a superb action adventure romance with terrific
acting
and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.""Crouching Tiger..."", I am told, is representative of a specific
literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior
piece...magic
and martial arts blended. I'm not familiar with the form, but the world
portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one. The story is
putatively
set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen. It is a
place
of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by
traditions and held captive by their forms. It is also a place of wild
and
mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that
featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's ""Lawrence of
Arabia!"") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply
cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights.
High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.In this world people may do amazing things. The flying in this movie --
properly called ""wire work"" in film terms -- is fantastic. This
technique,
of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of
""Crouching Tiger..."", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of
""Matrix."" Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb
walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not
to
mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a
mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to
duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost
plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least. The whole
packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers
Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times
throughout...At other moments, I found myself in weepy transport. As I think of the
fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and
sinus.Apart from all else, this is grand storytelling! It has passion, love,
revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.And, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film! Michelle Yeoh is
wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years. Here, she is more
mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in. Her performance
is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of
conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once. In
acting training we were always told you can't do that. She does
it.Chow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John
Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as
well...magnificent in his silences. Strength without cruelty.The center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15! Ziyi Zhang
whose
date of birth is given as 1979. Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has
only
one other film credit. She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding
element. And this newcomer holds it together! Holding her own with Yeoh
and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des
dieux's that frame the conflicts between characters. She is the ""Luke
Skywalker"" of the piece, if you will...though ""Crouching Tiger..."" has
everything the ""Star Wars"" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic.
Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant
spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in
providing only in the most self-conscious way.By the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or,
rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm,
that it almost disappears into dance. There is, I believe, only one small
splash of blood on-screen. Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that
if
you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action
advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the ""Full Peckinpaw,"" if you will.
Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences
that
take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave
you white-knuckled and sweaty.There are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of
mine)
does it all for real, without wires and tricks. True enough... But here
that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong
characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!I won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again,
perhaps
see it twice before it hits the home-market.My recommendation: Just go see it.",120,2000

""Justice League"" and ""Young Justice"". Unfortunately, this really falls
flat. It was certainly not what I was expecting.For starters, it was disappointing to see the JL operating with an
incomplete roster, with Green Lantern and Aquaman missing. The opening
scene, where mention is made that they're fighting The Legion of Doom,
piqued my interest briefly. This was far from entertaining though as
there were only 4 villains involved, without a Black Manta, Giganta or
Sinestro anywhere to be seen.My interest again returned when the image of Titans Tower appeared.
Sadly, once again, a mere cast of 4 uninteresting and somewhat flat
Titans appeared, with irritating character voices and 2 dimensional
personalities. So in short, the characterization was really poor in
this movie.As an adult, I found some scenes embarrassing and cringe worthy to
watch, and chose to Fast Forward the entire carnival scene. Maybe this
movie was made to appeal to children, but I have felt more comfortable
watching ""The Challenge of the Superfriends"".By the time the final battle happened, I was already checking my
Facebook messages on my iPhone, and wondering what housework needed to
be done.I really wanted this movie to be better, but truthfully, this was a
really poor effort. When you hear that the two greatest DC superhero

joke affair that seems to take forever to get to its well- telegraphed
""climax"", this justly titled ""Just a Little Harmless Sex"" was obviously
directed by someone who realized that the script was so boring that the
only chance the producer had of retrieving some of his money was a
quick sale to TV. The only trouble with this theory is that Rick
Rosenthal was both producer and director, so why he chose to direct
EVERY SINGLE CAMERA SET-UP in a boringly relentless TV style, abounding
with tight close-ups and two-shots (plus an occasional three for a bit
of variety) is a real mystery. Admittedly, the players do make a
gallant effort to keep the movie moving, but they are hemmed in by a
plot that telegraphs its next scene ""surprises"" well ahead of the game.
How the movie managed to amass such good reviews amazes me. Normally,
reviewers would tear apart such a poorly written and over- strenuously
acted show that moves with the pace of a snail from one boring,
well-telegraphed scene to the next. Admittedly, the players put a lot
of effort into their roles, but that's just the problem. Successful
acting must SEEM effortless!",98,1998
1273,11.0,6.8,"I saw this last night on the BBC--I don't think it ever had a
theatrical release in Britain--and thought it was excellent. I remember
this film and its rival, Without Limits, when they were released in
1997 but never saw them. Users have commented on how much this film
resembled the '70's era, right down to the soundtrack and overall style
of the film, as if that kind of authenticity is to its detriment. It
does remind one of that '70's TV movie classic, Brian's Song, but then,
what other era should this film resemble?! It's no surprise that the
documentary storytelling style works so well since the director and
writer, Steve James, made one of the most acclaimed documentaries of
the '90's--the basketball flik, Hoop Dreams (highly recommended as
well). But shooting a documentary and recreating the style of one are
two different things and though they probably both have their perils,
recreating that style in service to drama must have much steeper
pitfalls. Steve James (and company) completely succeed here. Jared Leto
gives a compelling performance as Pre and forces the viewer to
sympathise with him in very unique ways. He's not immensely likable but
when he runs...one understands that great athletic performers, like
Steve Prefontaine, did not win races on personality alone. But it's the
way that the rest of cast responds to him, their admiration completely
palpable and on the surface, that moves the viewer to embrace him as
well. He's heartbreaking when he asks, ""Do I look like a runner?""
American sports films usually obscure their central figures by ladling
on heavy doses of heavy-handed inspiration. Not so with this film. Pre
emerges a gifted, young, confused but determined individual who
inspires not through his athletic performances but through the strength
of his character and what he did for amateur athletics. The ending
doesn't so much jerk tears from the viewer as it allows them to flow
freely and copiously. An underrated, lost gem of a film.",106,1997

situations, mostly involving scatological humor, severed limbs and
organs, and sexual acts.Doesn't translate very well, does it? The same thing must have happened

them to do a treatment of Gerber's ""Howard the Duck"" strip. H & K

demographic it was pitched. The result is a kiddie move that tries hard
to be adult in all the wrong ways. The satire and keen observation of
the original strip disappear completely. I keep expecting The Goonies

1276,12.0,6.6,"American studios obviously believed two things: (1) that Godzilla could
be sold to American audiences, and (2) that American audiences wouldn't
watch the original Japanese version, and so a familiar American actor
would have to be added. The end result was the filming of many scenes
incorporating Raymond Burr as American newspaper reporter Steve Martin,
who just happened to be in Tokyo when Godzilla struck.In all honesty, I haven't seen the Japanese original (""Gojira"") and so
I have no basis on which to compare the two versions, so ""Godzilla:
King Of The Monsters"" has to be looked at on its own merits. Let's
admit right off the top that it has a lot of weaknesses. The Burr
scenes aren't edited in particularly well, there are some strange
decisions about dubbing (sometimes the original scenes are left in,
with Japanese language and all and a narration by Burr explaining
what's happening and sometimes English is dubbed over the original
Japanese, and there didn't seem to me to be any particular rhyme or
reason for which decision was made to which scene), the special effects
are primitive (but it was made in the 1950's), and the monster
stretched credibility a bit (partly the costume, and partly that he was
400 feet tall - how would the link between Jurassic era land animals
and sea animals be so big?) Having said that, unless your agenda is
simply to bash Americans for Americanizing the movie, you also have to
admit that it's not bad. The opening scene is marvellous, with Martin
being rescued from a destroyed building and brought to a hospital on a
stretcher. If you didn't know the story (and we do, so perhaps this
loses its impact) you'd swear off the top that this is a movie about an
atomic bomb attack. For all the above weaknesses, the movie's fun
pretty much all the way through if not particularly scary, and the
casting of Burr accomplished what the studios wanted - Godzilla became
as much an American cult classic as a Japanese one.The ending is a bit abrupt, and seemed pretty decisive, leaving me to
puzzle where all the sequels came from, but overall, if not great this
was still an enjoyable film, probably undeserving of some of the
criticism it gets. 6/10",80,1956

1279,12.0,7.4,"SPOILERSEven more than the original film, which channeled a mounting zeitgeist
of suspicion in a way that some found to be vaguely reminiscent of
McCarthyism, the 1978 ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" relies on a
paranoia that was distinctly related to the 1970s. In other words, it's
re-envisioned as my favorite genre of all: what I call the ""70s Doom
Film"".""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" presents an adventure that has few
equals in movies of this type, an adventure that finds our main
characters staying awake together at night, dashing down dark alleys
and hiding behind shipping crates, whisking away in taxicabs, and
hiding under desks in darkened offices after hours. Philip Kaufman has
given us a vision of an entire city gradually giving way to a
conspiracy helmed by extraterrestrial plant life that has randomly
fallen from the sky to take root on the Earth, duplicating human beings
(and destroying them in the process). The reason this movie is so effective, and one of the reasons why I
love it so much, is that the characters are all lovably odd. Donald
Sutherland's Matthew seems like a real stone-faced health inspector who
berates a snobbish restaurateur about finding a ""rat turd"" in the
grain, until you see him talking to Elizabeth and cracking jokes about
the job. Elizabeth, played by the wonderful Brooke Adams, is a little
offbeat, laughing nervously a lot and rolling her eyes in a bizarre
manner. Jack and Nancy Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright)
are completely off-the-wall, Jack being the tortured poet and Nancy
buying into outlandish theories of alien colonization and health food
while compulsively reading novels written by authors who were more than
likely tripping on acid. We believe them as odd but genuine characters
in real situations, particularly the touching romance between Elizabeth
and Matthew. Specifically, they are people with oddball characteristics
in danger of having those differences stripped bare by the alien pod
life. This film is a real credit to all of the talent involved in it.The tense and increasingly grim third act finds our heroes on the run
from people whom they may have suspected all along of wanting to harm
them. Shots of prowling police are interspersed with seemingly ordinary
people who have suddenly taken on an ominous attitude. The fact that a
good portion of it takes place without dialog shouldn't be a liability,
but it is here that the film begins to bog down a bit, and I think it's
because Kaufman so effectively portrays the exhaustion of the
characters that this begins to transfer to the audience as well. Like
the contagious quality of a yawn, the desperation that Matthew and
Elizabeth feel becomes pervasive.What seals this movie's place in history as something that freaked a
lot of people out in the 70s is the fact the conclusion is so downbeat
and agonizingly bleak. There is no happy ending for anybody; the
characters we grow to like are systematically worn down until their
fight is gone and their very need to sleep forces them to succumb. The
tragedy of Elizabeth's conversion to a pod seems very real, especially
when we see her soulless clone rising up out of the weeds like an ugly
vine. The starkness of her nudity, and the utter disregard that the
other pods have for it, strikes at a bleakness that is far more
terrifying than anything else in the film. Likewise, the final
confrontation between the converted Matthew and the still-human Nancy
is chilling not only because of the horrendous scream that she is met
with, but also because of the naiveté that does her in. As she crosses
the street, you can see her smiling at Matthew in a conspiratorial way,
never dreaming that he could have become a pod himself. The way his
face morphs into the grimace of one of the pod people represents a
betrayal of the worst kind. It suggests the very real fear that even
our most trusted friends and lovers can suddenly become different
overnight, turning on us for reasons unknown.Kaufman's dark fantasy has tapped into these emotions with stunning
ease, and he has created a beautiful, heartbreaking, and lyrical film
that is loaded with good stuff. Any serious fan of film or the
horror/sci-fi genre in particular should find this a really witty,
funny, and sometimes horrifying experience.",115,1978
1280,5.0,6.8,"One of my favorites. As a child, growing up in the NY Metro area in the
late 60s and early 70s, I was often afforded the opportunity to visit
NYC with my grandfather or father, as they conducted business there.
The gritty, bustling, human, reality of that city, particularly in
winter, have stayed with me. This film very aptly captures the stark, cold, matter-of-fact feel of
the NYC winter season, while keenly exposing the underbelly of the
region's infamous underworld of crime and policing. A great snapshot of
a place and a time and a culture. And the car chase is simply amazing. At least on par with the one in
""Bullitt"", and surpassing the chase in ""The French Connection"". I can
watch, time and again, as the suspension comes unstuck on that Plymouth
Fury police cruiser barreling toward the GW Bridge in pursuit, as it
lurches into that sharp right curve, bouncing and scraping into
oncoming traffic. The stunt driving coordinator for that scene did
""Bullitt"" and ""The French Connection"" as well as many other noatable
movie chases. Good acting, too, and a decent plot line. The musical
score is edgy and compelling, and the cinematography and direction are
top notch. A great, if underrated 1970s cop drama. A keeper. Not out on

1281,14.0,4.8,"I had my eye on this movie since it came out earlier this year. It was
a January release so I was in no rush to see it, but it had a genuinely
cool premise: looking for someone in the suicide forest, which is an
actual place in Japan where people go to commit suicide. It's pretty
unsettling. In the movie, it's said that the forest compels people to
kill themselves due to supernatural forces or vengeful spirits. The
Forest focuses on Sara, whose sister has gone missing in said forest,
and Sara's desperate endeavors to find her sister despite the evidence
pointing to her being dead. Up until about the 30-minute mark, I was on
board. The pieces were set, the exposition was established, and the
characters (Sara, her journalist friend Aiden, and a tour guide) were
finally heading into the forest. Again, the atmosphere is creepy
throughout. The director clearly has a grasp on how to build tension.The problem is that the promising build ups lead to zero payoffs. There
are handful of cheap jump scares, a couple of which admittedly shocked
me but only momentarily. Once the initial shock wore off seconds later
I was in the same state of mind as before. Effective jump scares linger
for a while; they imbue dread and usually add something to the
narrative. The jump scares here are your typical, ""Boo! Something's
behind you!"", which are easy to shrug off. Also, once they're in the
forest, the characters make some decisions that are unfathomably stupid
and out-of-character. Like, the main point of the forest is that it
makes you think you see things, a psychedelic effect if you will. So
after Sara receives this crucial information, she runs after the first
thing she sees scurrying around in the forest. While it's pitch black,
mind you. It completely takes you out of the movie and makes you lose
all empathy for the characters for putting themselves in these
avoidable situations. Also, The Forest focuses more on the bond between Sara and her sister
than the actual forest. So there are plenty of flashbacks, dream
sequences, all that garbage that just muddles the fact that, hey, this
forest is really f*cking scary. Why not focus on the forest instead of
forcing character development, if you can even call it that? It makes
no sense. Also, there's nothing we haven't seen before. People being
hung? First scene in Sinister. Claustrophobic underground tunnels? The
Descent. The only thing that makes the movie unique is the actual
setting which is used as a backdrop more than anything.The acting is good, as is the premise, but the potential littered
within this movie is never fully realized. The director can definitely
creep you out but he'll need a better script if he wants to make a
truly great movie. The Forest just leaves you feeling hollow and
disappointed.",93,2016
1282,11.75,5.6,"Up until the closing scenes Dark Was the Night is reminiscent of any
number of films by director M. Night Shyamalan. A strong sense of foreboding and tension is established early in this
film. The source of the terror that infects a US country town is hinted
at and glimpsed but never fully revealed, until the final scenes. As a result, Dark Was the Night could be described as somewhat slow by
some but that was not what I took away from this story. Its well acted,

1287,11.5,6.8,"As one of the other reviewers pointed out, this whole film is based on
a few lines of an autobiography where the protagonist Frank Harris
joins a group of cattle RUSTLERS for a spell. So in fact that as tough
as Glenn Ford and his crew are, at least they're on the right side of
the law. Also Frank Harris is probably best known for the first definitive life
of Oscar Wilde. And Harris like Wilde was born in Ireland. Might have
been nice if Jack Lemmon had played him with a brogue.Another reviewer pointed out that Jack Lemmon did not fit into the
western film. True enough, but in fact this is the story of a
tenderfoot who goes on a cattle drive and has quite the adventure. Still and all Cowboy is a pretty good realistic western about life on a
cattle drive. These drovers aren't any kind of heroic, but they do the
job that has to be done. Jack Lemmon's ideas about cowboys are taken
from the dime novels of the period. He gets rid of his romantic
notions, but fast.Among the supporting cast Brian Donlevy comes off best as the world
weary former town marshal who joins the drive to get away from his job
and meets a tragic end. Cowboy came out in 1958 which was the height of Glenn Ford's career.
Ford did some of the best westerns of the 1950s and Cowboy ranks right
up there.",92,1958

wouldn't, until now, have thought Puffin Asquith and Billy Wilder had
too much in common but after watching Shooting Stars it appears that
Puffin nailed the concept of beginning a film as a comedy and then
seamlessly seguing into near tragedy some 30 years before Wilder's
masterpiece The Apartment. Apart from Asquith only three names
connected to Shooting Stars mean anything today and even that isn't
much. Co-lead Brian Aherne went on to become a sort of poor mans'
George Brent, the perennial charmer who knew how to wear a lounge suit
and shoot his cuffs, Wally Patch, who lent rough-edged working-class
support to dozens of films and Chilli Bouchier, who enjoyed a mayfly
moment of fame in the early thirties and then disappeared gracefully.
The film itself, our old friend the Eternal Triangle, which even in
1928 was in possession of a Bus Pass, benefits from some sure-footed
direction from Puffin albeit uncredited and slips in some tasty satire
between clichés. For 1928 it wears well and is well worth a look.",80,1928
1289,12.6,8.0,"This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful, timeless epic romances of
all time, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Stunning
cinematography combines here with a turbulent historical setting, an
unforgettable idealistic hero, and one of the most compelling fictional
love triangles of all time. This surely ranks among the best of
director David Lean's many masterpieces. It is based on Boris
Pasternak's novel, which I confess to not having read so cannot comment
on the faithfulness of the film.The story revolves around the dreamy physician and poet, Yuri Zhivago,
and his dramatic experiences during the tumult of the Russian
Revolution. The story is told in flashback mode during later Communist
years by Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, a Soviet Army officer, to the
young woman, Tanya, who may be the long lost daughter of Yuri and his
lover, Lara. As a sensitive young boy, Yuri's mother dies and he is
adopted by a foster family, the Gromekos. Later reaching adulthood, he
studies medicine and marries his childhood sweetheart, Tonya, and they
have a little boy, Sasha. However, earlier at their engagement party,
he has found himself strangely drawn to a beautiful & mysterious woman
named Lara. Soon all their personal lives are thrown into turmoil by
World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution.The handsome Omar Sharif is brilliantly empathetic in the role of
Zhivago, masterfully conveying his character's emotions. Who can forget
his intensely expressive, tear filled eyes at some of the more
emotional moments, especially with snowflakes melting on them? A
physician but also a poet, Yuri has a deep appreciation of the beauty
around him. His gentleness and idealism stand in sharp contrast to the
horrific violence of war and revolution, as Yuri witnesses such
atrocities as dismemberment and cannibalism. Also, this is a man who
remains very much an individual despite the Bolshevik's philosophies of
collectivism.That era's devastating events unfold, including the Bolshevik
Revolution and subsequent Civil War between the Tsarist Whites & the
Communist Reds. However, the main conflict here is internal within
Yuri's own heart, as he is torn between fidelity and passion. He deeply
loves his sweet, gentle, and dependable wife, Tonya, and struggles to
remain faithful. Yet he is tempted by a forbidden passion for the
alluring Lara, a nurse at the wartime army hospital where both are
caring for wounded soldiers. Lara serves as his muse, speaks to his
soul, and is the inspiration for his poetry. Unlike most modern
cinematic tales of infidelity which involve little restraint or guilt,
Yuri and Lara desperately seek personal integrity as they are
repeatedly brought together (and separated) by the upheaval of war and
revolution. Surely if Yuri is 'the worst of sinners, then he is the
worst of sufferers also'. The two women in Yuri's life, wife and mistress, stand in sharp
contrast, though both come across as sympathetic characters. The lovely
Geraldine Chaplain portrays his ladylike, aristocratic wife, Tonya, who
is well bred and has been schooled abroad. The daughter of the
bourgeois Gromeko, she is actually Yuri's step sister, which might
understandably tend to elicit more platonic than passionate feelings
from her husband. Yuri and Lara succumb to their passions even as the
blameless Tonya is pregnant with Yuri's second child. Tonya is a warm,
loving wife and devoted mother, undeserving of her husband's
infidelity. Julie Christie plays the gorgeous & enigmatic Lara, a woman whose
station in life makes her vulnerable to misuse by men, yet she
possesses a genuine resourcefulness and inner strength. As a teenage
girl, she is seduced and violated by the lecherous Victor Komarovsky, a
despicable politician and her own mother's lover. She falls under
repeated abuse by this vile & contemptible character, who calls Lara a
slut and treats her as such. Later she is fiancé & then wife to the
misguided idealist and activist, Pasha, who holds intense political
ideologies which become more crucial than his wife to him. Pasha later
becomes Strelnikov, the obsessive Bolshevik officer who eventually
comes into confrontation with Zhivago. During much of the tumult, Lara
entrusts her own & Pasha's daughter, Katya, into the care of others. Of
course the legend of Lara lives on musically in Maurice Jarre's lovely,
haunting Lara's Theme.Supporting cast members include Rod Steiger, who is perfect as the
villainous Komarovsky, and Tom Courtenay as Pasha / Strelnikov, a shy
and pure individual who earns the abused Lara's respect and love, later
going on to become a cold hearted revolutionary. Alec Guiness portrays
Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, and Ralph Richardson is Tonya's
aristocratic & gentlemanly father, Alexander Gromeko.This film has amazing Oscar winning cinematography throughout. During
World War I and the Revolution, there are vivid scenes of battle, mass
desertion, and endless march through the desolate, blizzard ridden
Siberian wasteland. Also visually stunning is the spectacular train
ride Yuri and his family must make from Moscow to the Urals, site of
the family dachau. However, surely most viewers' truly unforgettable
pictures are the snowy white sleigh ride and the magnificent ice castle
at Varykino. No other film can compare in its depiction of winter
scenery. This sweeping panorama, the era's tumultuous political events,
and the emotional portrait of one sensitive man's experience of them,
create a visual masterpiece and a truly immortal screen saga.",197,1965
1290,4.5,6.2,"A friend of mine recommended Rob Gunnerson's ARC to me a while ago. He
had seen it at a festival and was raving about what a powerful piece of
film-making it is. I recently had the pleasure of catching it at the
Hollywood Film Festival and my expectations were surpassed by leaps and
bounds.ARC is packaged deceptively. It's opening is stylish, hip, disaffected
and edgy. It's a world of drug dealers, smut hustlers and hookers,
beautifully expressed in black and white with bursts of isolated color.
What's brilliant about this film, however, is that about a third of the
way through, it rips the unwritten contract between filmmaker and
audience in half. The film abruptly shifts from edgy and disaffected to
vulnerable and human.It's in this jarring break that I truly connected with Gunnerson's main
characters: a drug dealer and a prostitute. Regardless of what they do
for a living or what they've made of their lives, what's at their core
is made so identifiable by the filmmakers that it was impossible not to
see myself in their shoes. Which is scary as hell considering the world they're in. Once he's cast his spell and has your gut, Gunnerson, takes characters
and audience deep into one of the darker worlds I've seen on screen in
quite some time. I could hear the audience around me squirm as the film
edged towards a climax that is at once cruel, touching, and very, very
powerful.My hat's off to the entire cast (Peter Facinelli must be seen to be
believed) for giving this indie film performances that can only be
described as art.The director and D.P.'s collaboration should also be celebrated. The
film and its look feels so tailor-made for it's DV format that frankly,
it doesn't feel like DV it just feels distinctly THIS FILM. Clearly talented, Gunnerson has achieved the alchemy all directors
strive for, which is creating, out of nothing, a powerful, unique and
emotional experience that stays with you. I hope he makes more soon.",0,2006

home-grown movie. But this... I don't know where to start, the acting
is like watching a school play, over exaggerated movements which are
comical, the dialogue is stilted and amateur. Some members of the cast
are supposed to be school children and plainly look about 25, it's
insulting and unbelievable. Technically it's.... well i don't know,
it's..... not technical at all. The dialogue is all captured using
ambient microphones, you can barely hear the dialogue in places due to
traffic, bird song or the wind. The whole thing is shot in what appears
to be a lovely country house but whomever actually owns it (probably
one of the producers, director or 'mate of') has obviously blown all
their money purchasing or renting the property because inside the
refurbishment is as poor as the acting. Who the hell would spend 3
million on a house and then put a 'Beko' fridge in it? The floor
coverings, doors, door frames and skirting boards are straight out of a
90's new build house and not fitting at all with the period of the
house. All in all i'd say the first 1,000 people who rated this movie
are friends and family of the people who worked on it, certainly not
the people who worked on it themselves because i doubt that would
amount to more than 35 including the cast. What Budget? What script?

frustrated with its meaningless events, its miscreation and constant
super effort to become something important and special. There was no
acting, there was nothing that could actually save this. From the very

mission accounts of Walden's surviving crew, Serling constantly flashes
back to his own searing DESERT STORM experience and the Army's
subsequent attempts to whitewash the incident, resolving that his

film stands out as the most accessible, the most likable and the most

humane and involved individual.This film has everything that brings good humor to a movie. The classic
""fish out of water"" premise, amicable cross-cultural confusion, joyous
music...but it is much, much more than a mere comedy; much more than a
simple drama.This film was made in the thick of the civil rights movement. A black
man in close juxtaposition to a group of white nuns was an eyebrow
raiser in the 60's, as was the overall multicultural setting. White,
black, Mexican, Anglo, German, Hispanic - all are tossed together with
such a deft hand that the occasional nod to the prevailing racist
attitudes of the time is almost brushed aside as the film skillfully
makes its point. The emphasis here is on people doing as people should
do...working and living together, helping one another and learning and
growing from the experience.Perhaps this is the time for any of us who has seen this film to see it

1298,11.6,8.1,"I want to start by stating I truly have enjoyed all Star Wars movies
prior to this one. Even the prequels (which are obviously not as good)
demolish this movie in plot, character building and EVEN action
sequences. (there is only two lightsaber battles and they last seconds)Anyone with a brain and knowledge of the original trilogy can see that
Star Wars: Episode VII was a regurgitation of the first three film's
plot condensed into two hours. Everything was the same with slight
twists down to the famous ""Luke, I am your father"" scene except it's
with Han Solo and his apparent Sith son who stabs and throws off of the
new Death Star.They added a bigger and badder Death Star, tossed Anakin's lightsaber
around to whoever felt like using it to fight and did a terrible job of
carrying on Star Wars essence. It was flooded with humor and half a**ed
acting. There was no training or build up of power Rey is literally
able to defeat the most powerful Sith Lord as a teenage girl who days
before didn't even know she was a Jedi. Finn was able to wield and use
a lightsaber although as far as I am concerned he is not a Jedi. Han Solo and Chewbacca just happen to come across the Millennium Falcon
after 30 years which just happens to have Luke Skywalker's daughter,
Finn, and a droid carrying the map to Luke Skywalker on it. The film
was pretty much downhill for me from this point on I spent most of my
time watching this with a ""What???"" face and hands up in confusion as
to how they could have made the film suck so bad.This film literally spanned out the introduction of old characters we
know and love in order to keep our attention and keep us excited to see
the next only to disappoint us with no further elaboration in story and
literally no emotion. Leia hardly even reacted to losing the love of
her life Han Solo. The dialogue between the two of them was rushed and
obvious that they were trying to explain 30 years of story in small
talk. What I take as the mentality for this film: MAKE A BIGGER DEATHSTAR, OH
BIGGER EMPEROR TOO (srsly what was up with that), GIRL JEDI MAIN
CHARACTER, BLACK GUY WHO MIGHT BE A JEDI TOO MAIN CHARACTER (I am
African American so don't take this as racism) people are going TO EAT
THIS UP. And congratulations, you all did and now they will keep
milking the franchise and making terribly thought out films with
nothing more than CGI and humor to make up for it. Throughout this film I found myself wanting to walk out of the theater
and just be done but I couldn't resist waiting for the punchline of
this joke of a film and boy did I get it. After all of the humor
riddled torture we are brought to the final scene. Rey is going to see
her long lost dad who I guess spent all of this time standing on a
random mountain looking at the beach. And then it happens, what we had
all been waiting for. Luke turns around and sees the daughter he was
forced to abandon and she hold out Anakin's lightsaber as some odd
tribute to him (I don't see the symbolism in this) at this point I just
burst out laughing at how bad this journey has been and that's it it's
over. The next thing I see is JJ Abrams. I proceeded to scream ""BOO"" at
the screen multiple times with the only response to it being ""cmon it
wasn't that bad"" after that I walked outside and contemplated throwing
up as the movie was so bad it caused me to feel nauseous. This film took advantage of Star Wars fans and played into a hand of
re-doing famous scenes with different characters and telling the same
story over again. It's sad that people actually think this movie was
good or acceptable because now they are going to once again shame the

1299,10.5,7.3,"Coming Home is a great example of the way in which a movie can move
you, play on your emotions, without being sentimental in a negative
sense. Without being a tear-jerker. And without harsh images of
struggle and war. But with excellent acting, small gestures and not so
much words. This movie is all about empathy, first among the characters
in the story depicted, but by consequence also among the audience, that
is swept away and taken in by the sentiment.This doesn't mean that the story is only about love and compassion. The
Cultural Revolution in China (1966-1976) was far from being peaceful
and compassionate. People were separated for years without any
information, were forced to report any 'wrong' behavior that could
'harm' or 'threaten' the Communist Party. Coming Home shows how such an
environment affects people at the individual, family level. People get
damaged and family relations are shattered because of betrayal.Coming Home succeeds in portraying the consequences of such a regime,
by showing what humanity and compassion mean. And that is what makes it
special, and refreshing in a world where it sometimes feels like these

1300,4.5,6.5,"Pauline Kael, film critic for The New Yorker, quipped about this film,
""It's the kind of liberation movie that never liberated anyone."" That's
a clever line, but it isn't exactly true. Richard Brooks shows the
upwardly mobile as stiff dullards with drinks in their hands, the upper
middle class as stifling. The trouble with his film is the central
character: as played by Jean Simmons, she's one of those bored and
lonely housewives who desires MORE! Simmons is repressed of her
emotions, yet even when she makes her escape, she's still a pinchy
drag. The supporting characters aren't written any better, but the
performers themselves are surely more interesting: Bobby Darin is
terrific as a phony gigolo, Tina Louise excellent as an acerbic society
wife, Shirley Jones as a normal woman trying to remain casual about her
married lover, John Forsythe as Simmons' confused spouse (he doesn't
know how to reach her, which is a sympathetic quality since we don't
either). The title means to tell us that we make our own happy
endings--that we can't find them through other people--and the final
scene between husband and wife is a tricky little chess-move that
leaves us up in the air. I liked many things in ""The Happy Ending"", but

take, but then there's a freakish dwarf who comes in and makes it all
better. Also, note the symbolism of the wind up toys at the end. You'll

1302,14.0,6.2,"I have watched Umberto Lenzi's 1974 offering, ""Spasmo,"" twice during
the last week, and still find myself perplexed as to that peculiar
title...unless, of course, it refers to the brain spasms the picture is
likely to induce in the unsuspecting viewer! In this truly disorienting
experience, hunky dude Christian, well played by Robert Hoffman, picks
up a woman named Barbara (Suzy Kendall, looking for all the world here
like a poor man's Julie Christie) and goes back to her motel. A gunman
barges in, Christian kills him, the body disappears, and the bewildered
couple embarks on an increasingly loopy, borderline surreal adventure
peopled with ambiguously motivated characters and filled with bizarre
locations and non sequitur lines of dialogue. (And just what the heck
is the deal with all those mutilated and strung-up mannequins littering
the countryside?) As the excellent film reference book ""DVD Delirium 2""
puts it, the picture has an ""increasing atmosphere of mental
disintegration, creating the feeling that the viewer himself is losing
his mind."" So true. And yet, miraculously, by the film's end, and with
its chilling final shot, all the preceding zaniness suddenly makes
perfect sense. Whereas on my initial viewing I thought ""Spasmo"" an
entertaining hoot, a second look revealed it to be quite ingenious; a
small masterpiece, in fact. Lenzi's direction is both assured and
impeccable, the performances across the board are splendid (including,
of course, that of fan favorite Ivan Rassimov), and the score by the
maestro, Ennio Morricone, is both eerie and suspenseful. I don't know
if I'd term ""Spasmo"" a giallo--the film is almost wholly bloodless,
with no real murderous set pieces per se--a mind-warping mystery might
be more appropriate. Whatever you call it, though, I have a feeling it
is one film you won't soon forget. Highly recommended, especially when

characters and a very steady pace. it also incorporates a plot device
from ""Reap the Wild Wind"", and since Cecil B. Deille directed that and
his son-in-law Anbthony Quinn directed this film from his preparations,
that can hardly be a coincidence. it works in both cases, I must
report. The unusual set-up tells the viewer that Barataria, an island
ruled by Jean Lafitte is built upon piracy, but during the war of 1812,
and before, he has always refrained from bothering United States'
vessels. Now General Andrew Jackson has been charged with defending
nearby New Orleans with only 12,000 men against 60,000 British Imperial
redcoats and 60 ships. Lafitte's men want him to side with the stronger
force; he wants freedom and pardons for his men before ceding such a
strategic landing spot to the U.S. forces. There are other factors at
work in the story-line; pirate Bonnie Brown and her father want to
attack U.S. ships and do so in defiance of Lafitte's orders, leaving a
boy alive without knowing they have missed an eyewitness. When his
testimony finally comes out, Jackson cannot grant what Lafitte asks;
but Lafitte supports him anyway and in the fog, the pirates and Jackson
rout the British and he sails away to whatever destiny awaits a man who
had genius and statesmanship but not fortune. The cast of this colorful
and physically-lovely film are skilled indeed. Yul Brynner has one of
his best roles as the pirate king, Inger Stevens is beautiful; as the
girl he loves, Charles Boyer has many good lines as his adviser,
powerful Lorne Greene is a rival, E.G. Marshall the Governor, and
Claire Bloom is charismatic as Bonnie Brown. Others in the cast include
Ted de Corsia, Douglass Dumbrille, George Mathews, Henry Hull as
Jackson's adviser, Bruce Gordon, Onslow Stevens, Robert F. Simon, Henry
Brandon, Fran Jeffries, and Leslie Bradley, among others. The music by
Elmer Bernstein is very memorable, and the 1938 script remade here had
only to be freshened a bit. The shiny cinematography was the work of
veteran Loyal Griggs, the set decoration was supplied by Albert Nozaki,
Hal Pereira and Walter Tyler, with set decoration by Sam Comer and Roy
Moyer and costumes by Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Jester. Nellie
Manley did the elaborate hairstyles and Wally Westmore the difficult
makeup. The film contains quite a bit of good adventure-level dialogue
and a very strong climactic battle scene. Charlton Heston, as as Andrew
Jackson, prepared to play the part of an elder general and then
discovered the man was young at the time of the battle; but he is often

devil to have a baby. When she returns home she starts having
nightmares and seeing visions of demons.The problem is the movie is NOT SCARY and the acting is SO AWFUL. The
director seems to ""borrow"" a lot from other horror films. There is one
scene that is a complete rip-off of Rosemary's Baby.Tony Todd (Candyman) was listed as one of the stars but he doesn't show
up until the end and had a very small role. I actually felt bad he had

thin, and there are some super long scenes which make you wish that

the plot line whereby the heart of the story had some more explanation.

grandmother buries her and then commits suicide over her grave, giving
the body the lifeblood she needs to resurrect. So Little Dead Rotting

to find super-secret Grandma's note book, but not retrieve Grandma's
red cloak and sword...Quite a lot of the action takes place before LDRH actually gets into
her stride, there's the addition of a mysterious female character who's
supposed to mis-direct you but has little to do other than serve as a
plot signpost and you see through her in about three minutes. The same
with the ultimate villain character, she knows too much to be exactly
what she appears to be, there just seems to be something too off about
her to be a credible surprise.Eric Balfour does not disgrace himself in a part which is the everyman
heart of the story, divorced dad, two children, argumentative wife,
local boy smarts, all the usual boxes are ticked, but he still manages
to bring some empathy and intelligence to the role.",88,2016

damage on the cutting room floor. Maybe someone will demand a
director's cut one day, but I seriously doubt it.James Garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in
doing so brought a whole lot of Americans over to fill the cast out.
Folks like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we
have Vic Morrow who both wrote and directed this film.Garner always gets cast as likable rogues because he's so darn good at
playing them. But he has played serious and done it well in films like
The Children's Hour and Hour of the Gun. He can and has broken away
from his usual stereotyped part successfully. But A Man Called Sledge
can't be counted as one of his successes.He's got the title role as Luther Sledge notorious outlaw with a big
price on his head. After partner Tony Young gets killed in a saloon and
Garner takes appropriate Eastwood style measures, he's followed from
the saloon by John Marley.Marley's spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as
though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop
for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run. Garner gets his
gang together for a heist.Here's where the movie goes totally off the wall. Usually heist films
show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning.
Certainly that was the case in The War Wagon which some other reviewer
cited. But in this one Garner decides to break into the prison as a
prisoner of fake US Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak at
which time the gold will be robbed. That was just too much to swallow. If taking the gold was this easy it
should have been done a long time before. But I will say for those who
like the blood and guts of Italian westerns, during that prison break
there's enough there for three movies.That's not the whole thing, of course the outlaws fall out and we have
another gore fest before the film ends. But by that time the whole film
has lost a lot of coherency.The great movie singer of the Thirties Allan Jones is listed in the

and lots of moving camera that implies intelligent filmmaking it's a
miracle this film came out so wooden. And frankly boring. Part of the problem is Jason Robards in the lead--another actor might
have pulled off the drama and intrigue anyway. And the leading
victim-female is almost terrible--Christine Kaufmann. But the director,
Gordon Hessler, I think gets the worst of everyone, and all this
apparent money and talent is squashed under bright even light and
uninspired performances.There are lots of horror film clichés that might be satisfying to some,
including just the use of the theater as a set (somewhat like Phantom
of the Opera). But some of the clichés are cheezy 1971 versions, like
dreamy sequences with double exposures or slow motion, and strange
sound effects of choral voices. There were enough people who really liked this movie for the director
to mades an official director's cut with eleven extra minutes. Well,
why not? It's all voluntary, and I'd vote against it unless you are
really into the themes here, the actors, or just have a lot of time

1319,16.8,7.1,"When Lana Martin (Claudette Colbert) arrives by wagon with her new
husband, Gil (Henry Fonda), to Mohawk Valley and his homestead, she
isn't prepared for what she sees. The time is just before the
Revolutionary War. The valley is beautiful and unspoiled, but the
homestead is a one-room log cabin Gil has built, and the farm will need
to be worked by the two of them. Lana has never seen an Indian, but in
the course of the movie she's going to see a lot, and most won't be
friendly. Drums Along the Mohawk is John Ford's curious but effective look at one
aspect of the Revolutionary War. The story isn't about George
Washington or the great battles. It's the story of what happens in this
one, isolated valley in upstate New York. While there are Indian
attacks and we can see the results of a battle or two, the story really
is about Lana Martin and how she changed. We watch her and Gil build
their farm, and we see it burnt to the ground when war comes to the
valley. From a young woman in a big, frilly dress facing a life she had
never imagined, by the end of the movie Lana is wearing a soldier's
coat and is prepared to shoot down an attacker, which she does with
hardly a blink. She sees Gil return from his first battle almost
shell-shocked. We see her and Gil having to become hired hands when
their farm is destroyed. We see her suffer a miscarriage. At the start
of the movie, Gil was an honest, hard-working young man, almost naive
at times. Now he and Lana are watching the birth of their new nation.
They've both become...capable. ""Well,"" Gil says to her at the close, ""I
reckon we'd better be getting' back to work. There's going' to be a
heap to do from now on."" And we know he's talking about building a
nation, not just a new farm. The movie is effective despite John Ford's long-time propensity for
ham-handed humor, sentimental myth building and his indulgence in
stereotypical portrayals of Indians as either child-like objects of
amusement or animal-like objects of fear. What saves this story, as it
saved many of Ford's films, is his great talent for cinematic
story-telling. As corn-ball as some of the scenes in this movie are --
the short, chubby drunk or Gil's amazement that his wife is giving
birth or the wise but child-like behavior of the Christian Indian chief
-- we still are caught up in Gil's and Lana's story. Although the movie
is particularly a paean to the women who had to struggle on, sometimes
fighting, sometimes waiting, Ford gives the film an unusual unwarlike
tone. The widow Mrs. McKennar, who took Gil and Lana in when their farm
was destroyed, looks at Gil marching off to his first battle and thinks
about her husband. ""Sometimes he'd wave. Ten to one he wasn't even
seeing me. He was thinking about all those men, you see. All those men
he went out to fight...to kill and be killed...blast his eyes, loving
it."" One powerful scene has Gil and the other men back from the battle.
They won but it didn't go well. Gil has collapsed, and as Lana tends to
him he barely notices her. He just stares into the distance while he
tells what happened when they were ambushed. ""I got down back of a log
and aimed at a fellow. He leaped straight up in the air. Fell forward
on his face. After that we just kept shooting as fast as we could load
for I don't know how long. Adam Hartman came over beside me. His musket
was broke. He had a spear. He kept grinning. I remember thinking, 'He's
having a good time. He likes this.' Pretty soon he pointed off. I saw
an Indian coming toward us, naked. I tried to load but it was too late.
Adam stood up and braced his spear and the Indian came down. I never
saw a fellow look so funny, so surprised. He just hung there, with his
mouth open...lookin' at us, not sayin' a word. I had to shoot him,
there wasn't anything else to do."" Ford pushes the buttons of duty, faith and patriotism. We've learned
that war isn't the glorious struggle some make it out to be. Still,
Ford shows us that fighting to protect our land, to protect our chance
to build our farm and keep our children safe is proper. In 1939, that
was a strong message. So was his theme of patriotism with which he
closes the movie. At the fort in Mohawk Valley a company of regular
soldiers arrives to tell the people that the war has been won, that
Cornwallis has surrendered to Washington. They're carrying a flag. A
churchman looks at it and says to the others, ""So that's our new flag,
the thing we've been fighting for. Thirteen stripes for the colonies
and thirteen stars in a circle for the Union."" And with that a couple
of men take the flag and climb to the top of the church steeple, where
they tie it down so that it waves in the wind. Ford knew how to punch
home a point, alright. Fonda and Colbert were both fine actors. Fonda, in particular, brings,
as usual, a strong sense of decency to his role. While I think he and
Colbert make a slightly improbable pair (Colbert in all her roles, for
me, seems to have a sly worldliness that makes her so good at
sophisticated comedy), they work well together. The movie is really war
from a woman's point of view, and Colbert brings it off.",104,1939

another 7, The story line and subject was fine, 7 again, but I guess
the film maker had no money left over for a normal ending. And that

1324,8.2,6.4,"This review ABSOLUTELY CONTAINS SPOILERS. Be warned now.I was intrigued to watch this movie when I saw it listed on netflix.
This documentary is about lonely men who would like to find someone to
marry and they've taken to finding a mail order bride from the Ukraine
online.These guys are not to be pitied in the way some may pity them because
they're legitimately trying to find a wife that will like them. None
seem to be sexual predators whatsoever. They spend upwards of $10,000
plus to communicate with these women through a reprehensible dating
service that charges a royal fortune just for communication that in
some cases is not even legitimate.Such as one overweight man, a nice guy who spent over $12,000 to talk
with a girl who looked like a Russian Angelina Jolie (his words) who
may or may not have been talking with 60 other guys paying a fortune
also. Likelihood on she was talking to many guys and even more likely
the person he was talking to wasn't even the same person as the photo
he was shown. He was head over heals in love with her and even went on
a tour to meet Ukrainian singles in three Ukrainian cities but held out
waiting for her to show. She never did. He cried scam and the dating
agency scrambled to get the model to meet him. Something was fishy and
eventually he realized he was duped. But hey he said he'll try again...Another man, this time an old Australian man went as far as married one
of these Ukrainian girls in Indonesia after a long period of
communication and even came to the Ukraine to court her. He shouldn't
have as he was warned by a close friend of the would be bride that she
is only using him. He ignored the warning. After the wedding because he
was from Australia she had to go home to the Ukraine because of
immigration purposes. The man tried to communicate with her after the
wedding but she never responded to him. He gets worried and travels to
the Ukraine again to meet her to see what is up. After all she is his
wife. He meets her, she says no thank you, she walks out. He is
devastated. She later tells the documentary she was talking to many
guys keeping her options open for the best deal.A younger fella, falls for a Ukrainian woman, it seems to be going
good. He meets her on a tour to meet Ukrainian singles in three
Ukrainian cities, he believes a spark happens between him and her. He
falls in love. He communicates with her. They ""fall in love"" and he
travels back to the Ukraine to meet her and her family. While he is
there a ""police officer"" comes to arrest her for debt owed. Its $4000
dollars. The young fella says ""I don't have $4000 dollars I only have a
couple hundred"" and the so called police officer accepts that. The
young fella smelt something was wrong here, and he left empty handed
and I believe he knew he was scammed. My hope is he'll likely find a
nice American girl to settle down with and be the happier for it.One man did marry a Ukrainian. Very tall, pretty and stylish. She even
got impregnated by this guy. I hope it works out but I am suspect of
her motives. And I suspect I am not the only one.The entire point of this documentary is that Mail Order Brides aka
Russian Love Brides is a complete scam based on LUST not love. While I
don't doubt there are very very nice women in the Ukraine and Russia
that truly want to be married to a nice respectable guy from the west,
there is enough con artists out there to ruin it for everyone. And they
do this by promoting the hottest women you can imagine. Girls who if
born in North America would be Super Models, Actress, Married to Cartel
Dons or Billionaires. Women who would not even give these guys the time
of day in America. This is where the scam preys on unsuspecting guys
and lures them to dish out thousands of dollars to communicate with
them. Their weapon of choice is superficial lust.To my fellow guys out there my opinion about mail order brides is, be
careful, watch this documentary and others like it, before you give
your hard earned money away. And remember that you lusting after these
beautiful women is what scammers are counting on. So be smart if you
pursue a Mail Order Bride.And to any guy who was in this documentary who might be reading this, I
feel for you.",90,2014

interesting
as a not-too-subtle anti-racist parable about the plight of the outcasts.

1326,3.5,7.6,"Often accused of being less than the sum of its parts, ""It's a Mad Mad Mad
Mad World is one of the most precious gems in filmdom. True, it's far
from
being the funniest movie ever. Once, when Monty Python was putting a film
together, they found that after fifty-odd minutes the audience stopped
laughing. Thinking it was the material, they recut it so the latter
material came out first. The audience still stopped laughing at fifty-odd
minutes, even with what MP assumed the funnier materials backloaded. The
fact is, people can only laugh so long.Even armed with the information that an audience cannot sustain laughter
for
three hours, ""Mad World"" is not overwhelmingly funny. Though lots of
dialogue is amusing and all the performances are outstanding, but the
movie
suffers from a common delusion of people outside comedy, as Stanley Kramer
was, that the mere vision of cars crashing is somehow funny in itself.
One
is reminded of the spectacular sequence in ""1941"" when a ferris wheel
breaks
loose and rolls off a pier into the ocean. The sequence itself is
jaw-dropping and extremely well-done, and not funny for a
moment.The value in ""Mad World"" is its cast. Most of the big names in comedy in
the 1950s and 1960s made it into the cast (Ernie Kovaks, arguably the
brightest of the lot, originally cast in the Sid Caesar role,
unfortunately
died not long before shooting started). The casting of name comics in
tiny
roles doesn't do them justice: Stan Freberg has nothing to do but watch
Andy Devine talk on the telephone; Doodles Weaver is an uncredited ""Man
Outside Hardware Store""; the Three Stooges merely show up to be
recognized;
even Jack Benny, in a miniscule role funny merely because he's in it,
doesn't have an impact today because too few people remember who he was.
Again, some milk their small roles for what they are worth, giving the
movie
an undercurrent of true humor beyond the principals: Don Knotts, Carl
Reiner, Jesse White, Paul Ford, Jim Backus.""Mad World"" is most valuable simply because it is a cross-section of
comedy
in its day. Although he was talented in many ways, anyone unfamiliar with
Phil Silvers will see him in a performance that was the epitome of what he
was famous for. Dick Shawn's manic wildness is captured forever in a way
that is little seen in his few other films. Terry-Thomas, whose
brilliance
was too often relegated to obscure British films rarely seen anymore, is a
joy to watch and his British tilt provides a variation from Americans who
learned their craft in the Catskills and Vaudeville. Jonathan Winters,
whom
Robin Williams used as a prototype, was the most gifted ad-lib comic of
his
day and rarely showed up well when he was constrained by a script and a
sustained character, but he brings off many of the best laughs in this
film,
and, with Arnold Stang and Marvin Kaplan the most memorable set piece in
the
movie. Milton Berle and Micky Rooney both bring lifetimes of stage and
screen work to the project, and their input was invaluable.All the principals (Berle, Caesar, Adams, Rooney, Hackett, Terry-Thomas,
Shawn, Silvers, Winters, Anderson, Falk) are good. Even the ones who seem
to have been shorted of funny lines, like Edie Adams, and Eddie Anderson,
nevertheless come off well. Although they blend well together, there is a
subtle fight between them for attention, to steal a scene with a facial
expressions (watch Adams' face, for instance, when Caesar drags her away,
in
front of the ""Big W"", though you may have to put it on slow-motion) or a
bit
of business. You can see each of them thinking, at all times. Each gives
an intelligent performance, having laboriously hammered out their timing
and
their business, and they're all thinking, with the clockwork brains the
best
comedians have. They may not all be funny every minute, but every moment
they know what they're doing, crafting better performances than many
Oscar-winning serious actors have ever turned in.Though the movie might be too bloated for the promised three hours'
hilarious ride, with too much dependence on, ""Hey, there's Edward Everett
Horton flicking a switch!"" But anyone who loves comedy and its history
needs -- deserves -- to see the best in the business of comedy in 1963
interacting with their schtick, especially if they don't mind sitting
through -- occasionally mindless -- car chases and crashes.",154,1963

fun and simple. I can see it now: young, influential criminals holding up
entire banks with magic markers. Certain things in this movie make such
perfect sense, we wonder why nobody's thought of them before.Even the casting makes perfect sense. Who better to play a handsome,
spontaneous ladies man than Bruce Willis? And who could portray an
intelligent, hypochondriac better than Billy Bob Thornton? Together, these
two characters make the perfect man. Of course, it's only a matter of time
before a woman becomes involved and finds herself split between the two.But Bandits is anything but your average run-of-the-mill romantic comedy.

way that probably makes the other prisoners hit themselves on the head and
ask ""Why didn't I think of that?""Just as soon as they switch getaway cars, Joe and Terry rob a bank to
finance their upcoming adventures. After hooking up with an old friend of
Joe's, a wannabe stuntman played by Troy Garity, the criminals devise a
foolproof plan to rob banks: they take the bank manager hostage the night
before a heist, sleep over at his house, then go into the bank with him the
next morning before business hours. No unexpected holdups. No complications.
Just take the money and leave before the first customer arrives.The Joe and Terry dream of escaping to a tropical location and opening a
margarita bar. Their success as bank robbers eventually puts them at the top
of the FBI's most wanted list. Things become even more complicated when Kate
Wheeler (Cate Blanchett) runs into one of the crooks and wants to become a
part of their lifestyle. When she falls in love with both men, the situation
really starts to heat up. Oscar-winner Barry Levinsion gives Bandits a humble sense of reality. He
doesn't place Joe and Terry on a pedestal and treat them like superheroes;
he actually opens the film revealing their presumed demise. Although in
interviews he explains that he was initially unsure how to handle the
material, his uncertainty does not show in the final production. He has
found the perfect blend of romance, action, and comedy to satisfy all tastes
and styles. Bandits opens with a bookend revealing parts of the film's finale. This
doesn't really work. Normally, this technique is used when a movie is more
about a journey than what actually happens at the end. Although Bandits is
indeed more about a journey, the movie's structure does not support such an
opening. It doesn't provide us with enough information to work effectively,
and, after a final twist at the very end, this technique seems pointless
since it doesn't reveal the actual ending, anyway. Nonetheless, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett deliver
fine performances, forming a charismatic, unlikely love triangle. Troy
Garity, gleeful and eccentric, steals all of his scenes in memorable
supporting role. Despite the various structural flaws, the cast alone is
enough to redeem Bandits as an above average comic adventure. It's one of
the year's most fun surprises.",123,2001
1329,11.0,6.7,"Director David Gordon Green's critically acclaimed Undertow is a
strange but gripping experience. I don't know any other film quite like
this. We've seen the slow pacing build up tension in the plot before in
films, but it's so much more than that in Undertow  it's the pace of a
family's life in the deep backwoods of Georgia and it it patiently lets
us absorb everything. Maybe I was in a sensitive and impressionable
frame of mind when I saw it, because I remember being so shaken and
touched by this fare that its visuals and mood still haunt me.But this patient, slow pace is the calm before the storm as it comes to
an end when the brother of the father of the family comes to visit,
newly released from prison. Josh Lucas is this brother, and he captures
the shady nature of his character with effortless conviction. His
presence is felt in scenes he is not even in. Upon arriving to the
family, the film just takes a completely different turn and we follow
the two brave kids in the family on the run in the south from their
uncle.This is further emphasized by attention-grabbing frames that freeze
whenever intensity builds up. This may seem anti-climactic, but it's
extremely effective and it makes the chase sequences very exciting and
1970s-influenced. So it essentially shifts between chase mode and
(eerily) quiet South-paced calm in a genius way. If you like your films
fast-paced and action-filled however, its brilliance may be lost on you
 but if you give it time, Undertow will surprise you as it's
unpredictable, even in style. This is just how meticulously-crafted it
is.The film is grimy, dense, brooding and realistic and it zooms in on the
deep necks of Georgia, featuring some gorgeously striking visuals,
making you feel the dirt and heat of the deep south as if you were
right there, breathing the murky warm air from the brown rivers. Some
say Green's directing style is reminiscent of Terrence Malick (it is
very visually-driven) but I don't think so  rather it is an insult to
the former; Green clearly knows what he's doing and lets nature visuals
facilitate the story he tells, while Malick lets the story facilitate
his pointless nature visuals.I loved Undertow more every minute it progressed and am now prepared to
give this film a 9 out 10. I also have it firmly stapled in my top 10
films of all time list and that is quite a feat for such a low-key dark
horse. 9/10",108,2004

belonging to the ""so bad, it's good"" category, right up there with the
products of the likes of Edward Wood Jr. or Doris Wishman. This explains

1333,4.5,6.1,"Shrewd and scrappy pool hustler Kailey Sullivan (a splendid and
mesmerizing performance by Famke Janssen) wants to rescue her loving
son Gulley (winningly played by Jaymie Dornan) from her strict,
demanding, and abusive ex-husband David (a fine portrayal by Matt Ross)
and start a new life for the both of them in Canada. However, Kailey
needs $50,000 bucks in order to accomplish this particular goal.
Writer/director Chris Eigeman's debut feature scores strongly with its
beautifully well-sustained brooding and melancholy tone and a
flavorsome and fascinating evocation of a fiercely competitive
underground sports culture. Better still, Eigeman admirably eschews
sappy sentiment and lurid melodrama in his hard-boiled approach to
Jailey's dire predicament. That said, the scenes between Jailey and
Gulley are nonetheless still quite touching. Janssen positively shines
in a juicy lead role; she brings a truly riveting and nuanced blend of
toughness and vulnerability to the compellingly rough-hewn character of
Jailey. Janssen receives bang-up support from the always wonderful Rip
Torn as Jailey's wise and supportive mentor Teddy Quinette, Lois Smith
as Gulley's snippy and meddlesome grandmother Abby, Marin Hinkle as
David's sweet new wife Ellen, Terry Kinney as the antsy Markus, John
Juback as formidable professional pool player Duncan, and Tony Robles
as polished young upstart Ralph. Herman Micheal Otano's slick and
prowling cinematography brims with style and energy. The
moody'n'melodic score by Cloggs likewise hits the harmonic spot. This
picture earns bonus points for not punking out with some phony happy
ending that wraps things up all nice and neat in a bow; instead the
conclusion is absolutely devastating in its startling bleakness. Highly
recommended.",92,2007

can identify with the vib of New York, the film is likely to be
appreciated even more, as elements of the subway and streets come

1336,15.333333333333334,2.4,"This movie gets a 5 out of 10 not because it deserves five points, in
fact, I don't think the quality is such that it deserves one point. But
it is just so god damn bad that I love it enough to boost up the
points.To begin with, Richard Gesswein is the worst leading man ever to grace
the silver screen. They had to get someone to pull a voice-over for his
role, Coldyron (Yeah, that's a tough name), as well as his leading
lady, Dr. Steele's part. Dr. Steele, by the way, is a bodybuilder woman
with a skunk on her head.The opening scene reveals the end of the movie immediately telling you
that you are wasting an hour and a half. These three guys (the
director, writer and star) came up with enough money to take RoboCop,
The Terminator, and Judge Dredd (which was merely in comic book form at
the time) into one completely awful masterpiece.When we go back to the beginning of the story, the clock strikes 5:00
and Coldyron wakes up. Just as a quick note to the viewers, the
filmmakers then had the clock read 4:50, as if to say, ""Please, it's
not too late for you, turn off the TV and RUN!"" Of course, I didn't
follow the directions, I just laughed. Shortly thereafter he fills up a
cup of coffee with far too much sugar and you're thinking, ""Wow, he
sure likes sugar."" (This is a joke that you will soon be hoping the
filmmakers didn't find to be funny). He grabs carrots from the fridge
and heads outside, to his horse. You think the carrots are for the
horse, right? But he gives the horse the coffee! THAT'S why there was
so much sugar! Then HE eats the carrots himself! AHA! SO FUNNY!! This
is about how great the entire movie is.Absolutely nothing makes sense in this movie. Gesswein says that ROTOR
will be ready in 25 years, then says he needs at least 4. Shortly
thereafter a Native American character named Shoeboogie puts his
headphones in the wrong place and sparks ROTOR. It just makes no sense
at all.I won't go into too many more details, but the worst part of the entire
movie must be the fact that ROTOR can take off his sunglasses AND SEE
INTO THE PAST! Apparently a function called SENSOR RECALL was built
into his system, but it is so insanely dumb that the screenwriter
didn't even bother trying to come up with some sort of half-assed
explanation. None of the technical jargon even sounds like it makes
sense, but he didn't even try going into sensor recall.You have to see SENSOR RECALL in action to truly appreciate it's sheer
madness.At the conclusion of the movie, Coldyron utilizes a technique
Shoeboogie spoke of earlier to kill ROTOR, as if to tie everything
together in some sort of nice neat way. One of the problems is that
Shoeboogie never spoke to Coldyron. Another is that a few pieces of
string defeat this unstoppable supercop.Another is that I am trying to make sense of a movie in which the comic
relief is delivered by a Robot who can think on his own, but the
supercop won't be ready for another 25 years.ROTOR is the worst movie ever made. If you can find something worse,
please bring it to me, because I need it.Please see ROTOR. It is so bad, you will hate me for making you watch
it.And then you will make all of your friends watch it...and you will love
me once more.""Look at these cheekbones: I'm either an Indian or a sissy. And, heh

1337,7.5,4.9,"As a standalone goes, this isn't bad and is miles ahead of its terribly
lame unrelated second sequel 'Curse III: Blood Sacrifice (1991)'. Still
even here, I couldn't help but be a little disappointed with the final
outcome. What begins promising and ends so (mainly centring on
Screaming Mad George's tremendously vivid and killer first-rate special
effects) has too much time on its hands when it should be more exciting
than it actually is with an odd, colourful assemble of sub-plots
hanging off its already creative premise. The problem is it seems to
want to only the scrape the surface with minimal details, than delving
in deep with any sort of lasting imprint and ends on a whimper. So the
comparisons to Cronenberg's cerebral remake of 'The Fly' seemed to be
unjustified, with only the transformation effects ringing true. Leaving
it as a simple, taut and silly b-grade cautionary on-the-road feature.
Although expect something dreary, downbeat and utterly horrifying.
Likable leads Jill Schoelen (who's always a complete delight) and J.
Eddie Peck (the poor guy goes through the slivering changes) make the
trip an easy ride. There's fun support in the shape Jamie Farr, Bo
Svenson, Sydney Lassick and Savina Gersak. The atmosphere might be
lacking (even though the well presented photography frames the
blistering sand bowl locations to good effect), but it has a real nasty
streak abound (the plastered shocks and unnerving deaths) and the
macabre effects are grotesque and leave sickening punch in the guts. It
looks like they were trying to blow you away, and it mostly does good
at that. I guess we know what the main selling point is here.",0,1989

having that obnoxious fatso-brother appear in the film at all? And
let's face it, the special effects in places were not exactly state of
the art either, neither were the editing. So why give it an 8 then?
Well my rating couldn't have been any lower, and this is based solely
on the fact that the film positively reeks of unique and creepy
atmosphere, atmosphere so dark that I put it up there with the
Kane-scenes in ""Poltergeist 2"", and the atmosphere in ""Exorcist 3"".

out are when the mother of the family tries to "" connect the dots"" on

sowing, and then starts to jam the needle and thread into her hands!
Excellent! Not to mention the infested fruit and vegetables! All in
all,there is in this film a disturbed and unsettling tension that you
seldom get to witness in other horror flicks of the same decade, and
certainly not in contemporary and crappy Hollywood blockbusters, that's

blood-spattered crime-flick written and directed by Peter Hyams, which
stays loose and shaggy and doesn't wrap itself up too much in
seriousness or pretensions (until the finale). Two Los Angeles vice
cops, tired of seeing their prize busts going unrewarded by a police
commissioner who is on the take from a sleazy crime czar, use their
down-time to shake up the kingpin, whom they are sure is about to pull
off a major drug exchange. The leads are a lot of fun, particularly
Gould, and Hyams keeps the camera moving-moving-moving until you feel
convinced he must have his cinematographer strapped to the back of a
motorcycle. There are the usual cheap shots, titillation asides, a
blatantly moronic judge, and the proverbial exasperated sergeant who
keeps saying things like, ""My ass will be in a sling!"" Hyams is really
tough on Los Angeles, and one might come away from the picture asking:
if the police force were so corrupt, wouldn't that be a bigger story

1342,4.5,5.8,"For his debut as a director, actor Chris Messina made Alex of Venice,
an interesting but not totally satisfactory drama which takes advantage
of its main actress' big talent, even though she might have deserved
more substantial material to work with. Don't misunderstand me... Alex
of Venice is a competent drama with excellent performances and a
realistic story which deals with difficult and emotive topics without
employing Hollywood's false sentimentality. Messina's direction is
fluid and efficient, lacking of any affectations and with a good eye to
create an urban/bohemian atmosphere reflecting the contrasts of the
Venice neighborhood in Los Ángeles. The problem/pro of the film is
letting the story be developed through the main character's silences,
as well as her subtle changes of expression. Needless to say, Alex of
Venice counts with a tremendously expressive actress who fully
dominates her craft in that role; but I think co-screenwriters Jessica
Goldberg, Katie Nehra and Justin Shelton relied too much on Mary
Elizabeth Winstead's talent, and they omitted important pieces of the
narrative puzzle, making the movie feel... I don't know... incomplete
and premature. The main thing which makes Alex of Venice worthy of a
moderate recommendation is the perfect performances, not only
Winstead's, but also the ones from Don Johnson, Skylar Gaertner and
Julianna Guill. In conclusion, I think Alex of Venice represents a
decent debut from Messina as a director which counts with a cast whose
brilliant work is helpful to overcome the limitations of the screenplay
to some point. I think Alex of Venice should have gone farther in the
dramatic aspect, emphasizing the main character's evolution instead of
getting distracted with peripheral events which obliquely contribute to
the story, but without deepening enough on the main character's
experiences.",86,2014

seemed to come together to a point where I was able to connect
emotionally with its characters. Hall portrays Hannah, living in a backwoods area of Maine, who is
grieving the loss of her husband Hunter, some two years before, from a
hiking accident, He was a singer/songwriter who had a wildly successful

write her own biography of Hunter, and resists Andrew until she

more information, he begins to suspect that Hunter may have committed
suicide and that his death was not an accident. The interplay between
the two works well, at times, but at other times seems forced and just

are only 10 prior reviews, with an average of just 4.5 stars out of 10.
I almost didn't watch this movie because of its low overall score but
I'm very glad that I did because it turns out that this
suspense/mystery/love film is at least 9 stars. Compared to the usual
mystery movie it is a big breath of fresh air. The dialog is very
thoughtful, in most places philosophical, with the characters
discussing the relationship of love to stories and of story-telling to
reality (and much more). After so many mystery movies with standard
dialogs and plots, this film is very refreshing. The movie involves several parallel stories, with each addressing the
nature of the role of deceit and love in life. For example, an elderly
Jewish man tells of his experiences in Nazi Germany while interviewed
by the hero (a film-maker named Danny Hart, played very aptly by Henry
Ian Cusick). In parallel, Danny himself is being interviewed by someone
else (I won't say who) and tells his own story of meeting a young woman
on a train. Each character, in turn, tells their own stories about yet
other characters.There are so many twists and turns in the plot that I was reminded of
The Magus. At the end of the movie I spent quite some time thinking
about the statements made by the characters and about the film's
conclusion, which in general is the sign of a very good movie -- like
reading a short story by Somerset Maugham. The movie's plot structure might be too difficult for the average
viewer but will be thoroughly enjoyed by those who like a complex,
thoughtful, intriguing movies regarding good, evil, love, betrayal,
truth, art, reality -- for them this movie will deliver an unique
experience (like Wood Allen's 1989 movie Crimes and Misdemeanors). I normally don't review movies but I felt that this movie deserved a
much higher rating. I will not give it a 10 just to raise it's rating.
I believe it deserves a score of 9. The reason that it is not a 10 (at
least for me) is something I cannot discuss here because I don't want

that the actor doesn't look very much like the great man - he PRESENTS
a great man in a health crisis to perfection. LIndsay Duncan is
'Clemmie' exactly as I remember her from the public image of the time.
The way her hair is done is exquisitely correct. I was eleven and I
remember the drama of Churchill's illness from the newspapers. I
remember, as a boy, noting that Churchill's personal doctor was a
certain Lord Moran who came and went initially at the famous front door
of Number 10. We all knew that Chartwell was the Churchill country seat
(not his 'ancestral home' which, as we know, was Blenheim Palace where
he was born.) It was wonderful that the filming took place at
Chartwell. We also knew that Churchill's children were difficult,
particularly the boorish Randolph, and that Sir Winston was probably to
blame for having neglected them through his undoubted self-absorption.
Romola Garai, as always, creates a memorable personality with her
entirely believable ace nurse. The casting is superb, the settings
perfect and the art direction highly sensitive. And the cars! How I
loved the shiny cars of my childhood. There's a pristine, bulbous
Austin that I remember admiring as a boy. Delicious visual details are
abundant in the film. There were many moments when I was surprised by
my own tears, notably when Lady Churchill, having warmed sufficiently
to the newly-met young nurse, poured out the story of the child she and
Winston had lost; to this wise, down-to-earth, delightful young woman.These were probably the last days of the ""right to rule"" self-image of
the Tory Party. For England's powerful middle classes it was still
normal to think of a Labour Government as a temporary aberration. The
moment I saw the book that Winston inscribed to his nurse I recalled
that not even the first volume of ""A History of the English-Speaking
Peoples"" had yet been published. But it didn't matter in the slightest.
It was not a gaffe. It was an inspired and moving moment in the plan of
this outstanding film. The acting skills on display in 'Churchill's
Secret' are - I submit - breathtaking. Why do we take for granted the
artistry of our wonderful British actors? We need to show them our love
with the compliments they deserve.",100,2016
1351,13.25,5.3,"A Gen Z update to Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 cult classic, this remake is
essentially an episode of Fast and Furious in which the vehicular
exploits have been replaced with an assortment of extreme sports
sequences. Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and
physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather
impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the
tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact
of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost
every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay,
every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the
air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing.
Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with
clichéd stinkers like ""the only law is gravity"" and ""everyone dies,
it's just a matter of how"", it's nothing short of unintentionally
hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going
to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic
eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for
low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as
Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This
modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences,
yet they're not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise
a limp and incoherent thriller.",114,2015

Water"". This is no monster movie. It's a quietly intense psychological
film, that works amazingly well. The fact that it was literally shot
without a crew makes it nearly a miracle of a movie.I was pretty impressed by the cast, especially Susan (Blanchard Ryan).
It isn't often that two unknown actors can carry a film so well. Their
emotions are very real which really adds to the tension.I'm pretty sure the director (Chris Kentis) will go on to make some
good bigger budget movies. He's got a real knack for building suspense.
I was also impressed with the organic structure of the narrative.
You're not really sure where it's taking you, which only adds more to
the horror of what eventually happens. Kentis' dialog writing seems to
be the weakest aspect of the movie. Some of the dialog the actors have
to (literally) spew is awkward and extraneous, sort of a failed comic
relief. In a no-budget movie that's often the case. Hell, that's often

two Japanese brothers, one traditional and one a powerful businessman,
fighting over a set of ancient family swords. The American is brought
in as a courrier(and planted thief)and becomes embroiled in the battle.The amount of action and gore in this movie is unbelievable, and the

1356,10.0,7.9,"My favorite Bogart movie is also Key Largo. Even before Edward G.
Robinson and his hoods take everyone hostage in Lionel Barrymore's
hotel there is a tension that does not let up for one second. Movie
goers had to be on the edge of their seats in 1948.There is one scene however that I don't think viewers today can fully
appreciate. Lionel Barrymore had been acting from a wheelchair for 10
years and movie audiences were used to that. When Robinson and his
goons goad him to a futile gesture of bravado, Barrymore rises from
that chair and moves slowly towards the snickering Robinson. He swings
and misses and falls down and Bogey and Bacall pick up Barrymore and
bring him back to his wheelchair. The shock value of that scene for
1948 audiences would have a dimension that can't be appreciated now.Robinson's Johnny Rocco is based on Lucky Luciano who had been deported
a few years back. He's evil incarnate and Humphrey Bogart as Frank
McCloud is the jaded, cynical former idealist who redeems himself and
becomes the countervailing force for good. They play well against each
other in a reverse from the 1930s Warner gangster flicks where Robinson
was usually the good guy.Who could have known this would be the fourth, last, and best of the
Bogey and Bacall teamings.",100,1948

sooner or later. And chances are, being a fan of how movies were made
back in the day, you'll understand what these creative folks were going
for. It's a satire/spoof! It's not a blatant attack on movies of similar
genres (a la Naked Gun), but a subtle one because THEY PLAY IT
STRAIGHT. And therein lies the genius of this film. It's a satire
that's played straight. Even though the actors, bless their hearts,
seem like they're sometimes about to bust a seam speaking the lines,
they are intentionally trying to be serious. Every cast member,
especially Edward Underdown and Robert Morley (as Chelm and Peterson),
understood and delivered their lines to perfection. ""The men of this
world most in need of a beating up are all so incredibly large..."" Or
something like that. Hell, Bogart just sat back and let the humor flow
all around him. And good old Jennifer Jones. The old Selznick factory
product finally gives a performance that's not artificial. What's
amazing is that renowned Italian actress Gina Lollobridgia took part in
this production. My theory is, she didn't know what the hell was going
on. They gave her the script, told her to play it seriously, and didn't
clue her in on the joke. There had not been a film made like this
before, and there hasn't been one made since. Perhaps this film has served a lesson to studios over the years.
Sometimes, I think some of todays satire/spoofs do venture close to
Beat the Devil ground (Zoolander), but none of them ever reach it for
fear of the audience not getting it, as I understand most of Beat the
Devils audience of 1954 did not get it. Imagine Mike Myers playing
Austin Powers straight, and not trying to be funny in all the
situations he's in. To me, that would be immensely more funny.",89,1953

used to enjoying comedy and far out roles for him...but his take on an
ordinary character with problems was unexpectedly deep and rang true. The ending and the overall message that the movie left was also a
pleasant surprise. I first thought this movie was going to be a study

formulaic output of Hollywood, but still have a passion for film, this
might just be for you. Granted, it's not for everyone. I can only speak
for myself. I still have chills from my first viewing. Only after it
was over did I understand I had just watched the second film from the
man behind Rubber. Glad I didn't even know, as expectations would have
been quite high. Having grown up with rented video tapes in the 80's,
this speaks to me on an intuitive level, using a language of cues, but
remixed with a great deal of finesse and an engaging visual style,
which had me grabbing frames here and there for inspiration in my
architectural work. While shot with a keen eye for color, depth and
composition, the film's strength lies in its mastery of the time
domain.The storyline edits weave jaggedly into each other in a provocative
manner and the art house ingredient, psychedelic in its simplicity,
works its magic once it has taken hold of you. I see no room for
improvement here, it is simply a great work. Where Rubber was a
testament to the strength of the storytelling formula, this is the
master wielding it just forcefully enough to grab people's attention. I
suspect there's a lot more where this came from. As someone who lives
with parts of stories, unfinished tracks slaved over in the recording
studio, this ode to the behind- the-scenes heroics of unsung heroes was
beyond captivating. Like an Ayahuasca trip, it is best described as
liberating...like an itch, scratched at last. Bravo!",95,2014
1360,9.666666666666666,6.4,"As is, this movie is loosely a romantic comedy which tries desperately
to inject drama into a shallow, unconvincing plot. The story centers
around the plight of a woman who has a child out of wedlock in a small
Irish village in the 1950s. Instead of exploring the realistic spectrum
of human behavior that could arise in such a situation, it relies on
stale caricatures. It spends a lot of screen time trying to show how
hypocritical all the village folk are as they look down on this poor
single mother yet indulge in bad behavior every chance they get. For as
we all know from watching many Hollywood movies, in the 1950s the world
was ruled by silly hypocritical cavemen who forced their oppressive,
outdated morality on the enlightened young'uns.The main characters are not especially likable and when the single
mother develops a new love interest, the plot fails to give a
convincing reason why the couple would care about each other (beyond
lust). That makes it very hard to care what happens.Honestly, some people might think this movie is OK, but very few people
will love it. The acting is decent, but the plot is just so uninspired

current with today's modern times of lgbt acceptance. sorry, i think
these critics are out-of-touch and don't realize that yes, many still
live in very conservative communities where being gay is not accepted,
even in the states believe it or not. Even if parents are OK, it is
difficult to instantly let go of your dreams for your kids having a
*normal* life and worry about social scrutiny your kids and family will
now face.this is well acted, particularly by Heigl, Emond, Wilkinson, and Gummer
as they have the biggest roles here. Too bad Bledel's character didn't
have much to do. The music could have been bit more subtle and the
ending seemed lacking a bit. Transitions at times aren't very smooth,

virtuosos, Isaac Stern... Composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon
Harnick captured the drama and conflict of the story from its incisive
opening to, ultimately, the powerfully silent human circle at the very
end... Their treatment of the music produced some outstanding hits like
'Tradition.' 'Tradition' is more than a simple musical number... The brilliance of
this song is in its ability to introduce the impoverished village and
its characters  from the figure of the funny fiddler to the pathos and
witty humor of Tevye, to the creaky old rabbi, to the bright-eyed
matchmaker, to the sharp-tongued Golde, to the indecisive tailor, to
the audacious revolutionary, to the enthusiastic butcher, to the
Constable who brings that terrible order  It is the solid center of
the film.. Yet one by one, the traditions that the very poor dairyman
of Anatevka and his people have cherished and lived are broken during
the course of the film, as marriage are no longer arranged by the
'papa,' as men and women dance together in a public place, and, most
grievous of all, as children marry out of their faith... The shattering
of these traditions becomes even more intolerable to Tevye in the
shadow of other dangerous forces which threaten to destroy the very
life he is trying to preserve...Under Norman Jewison's direction, the entire cast delivers a depth
performance and a spectacular energy that brought smiles and tears to
the audience... Few musical characters are so fully realized or so
deeply engaging...Topol warms hearts and evokes laughter with his deep humanity, wisdom
and humor... He brings his own magnetism and appropriate
world-weariness to the role... With his raspy voice, virile appearance,
and alternating expressions of compassion and implacability, he reveals
his thoughts to the audience, always quoting ""the good book."" He even
shakes a czarist soldier's finger rather than his hand, and questions
his loyal wife after 25 years of marriage on whether or not she loves
him...Norma Crane brings out a concerned mother and a devout Jewish woman...Molly Picon shines as the garrulous Yente, the village matchmaker who
fails to arrange suitable marriages for the three strong-willed

was very plain, it was about a man who's living with remorse and
suddenly an unexpected thing happens that could help him to come out of
his guilt fell, but it only gets worse in his every attempt.The contribution from the rest of the cast was one of two reasons for
the movie's downfall. They were okay, no complaint about that, but they
were totally not visible like their existence means nothing other than
to support the Gere's role. And the other reason was the scenes that

1370,9.75,7.3,"David Mamet once explained the difference between art and
entertainment. Entertainment, he said, reinforces what you already
know, and tells you that you're right. Art, on the other hand, suggests
that what you know is wrong, and that your beliefs might not be
correct.In ""To Live and Die in L.A."", director William Friedkin inverts,
twists, and eventually demolishes the standard ""Cop seeks vengeance for
his partner's murder (with 3 days til retirement!)"" formula. The viewer
learns that 1) not every law enforcement agent always has the public
good in mind, 2) real people generally aren't either 'good' or 'evil'
all the time, 3) if a cop (or in this case, Secret Service agent) takes
the law into his own hands, he WILL pay for it one way or another, and
4) whether you're a cop or a criminal, things usually don't go
according to plan.This information is directly opposed to what we've learned from
countless action movies of the 1980s. Watching the ""Lethal Weapon""
movies, or anything with Schwarznegger, Stallone or Seagal, suggests
that it's fun and entertaining when cops take the law into their own
hands. Notice that no matter how much damage Riggs & Murtaugh cause,
they can laugh about it with the captain later, and the world is always
a better place for it. And no matter how many people's civil rights are
trampled, and no matter how illegal the cops' activities are,
everything always works out in the end, and the only people who get
hurt are the ""bad"" people.""To Live and Die in L.A."" shows what would happen if Riggs & Murtaugh
tried their antics in the real world. While Martin Riggs' arrogant
recklessness is heroic and hilarious, Richard Chance's arrogant
recklessness ruins a lot of lives, not least his own. When it's over,
justice has hardly been served, and even though the bad guys are dead,
there's no hint that L.A. is a better place for it.With all these ""Lethal Weapon"" comparisons, I should make it clear that
""To Live and Die in L.A."" came out in 1985, two years before the first
LW movie.All that stuff aside, this is one rock-solid movie. Willem Dafoe uses
his character's eccentricities to create (for my money) one of the best
villains in cinematic history, even if the movie doesn't see Rick
Masters quite that way. William Peterson is incredible and brings a lot
of depth to his performance; I'm not one to critique someone else's
opinion, but I don't understand the users who complained that he's
""wooden."" Chance is an egomaniacal, scheming nutjob with a death wish;
he really believes that he's above life and death, and it never crosses
his mind that he might be wrong. Peterson brings this all out.Dean Stockwell is in his element, playing a scumbag who knows
everything about everyone. John Pankow was a wonderful surprise,
bringing all sorts of conflicting and confused ideas to Vukovich, which
is perfectly appropriate. When things really go wrong, he goes to
pieces. Again, some users complained that he was overacting, but ask
yourself how YOU'D behave. Nobody ever gives Darlanne Fleugel much
credit, but she's terrific here. There's a whole lot going on in Ruth's
head, and in many ways, she's the central character to this whole play.
Pay attention. And I'd be remiss in my duties if I didn't point out
Steve James and Jack Hoar as two of Masters' criminal associates.
They're both tough, intimidating, and surprisingly multi-dimensional.And I haven't even mentioned 1) the car chase to end all car chases, 2)
the copious amount of nudity, 3) the perfect fit of Wang Chung's
soundtrack with the day-glo L.A. look, even as all hell breaks loose

climactic shock that WILL knock you for a loop.",116,1985

1373,4.25,4.7,"This is your typical lazy kiddie fare that puts a bunch of animals on
screen and makes them do people stuff. That's really not enough by
itself to make something funny. This goes beyond being forgettable by
further assuming you can engage in rampant stereotyping simply by
making the characters dogs. I don't enjoy this depiction of Mexican
culture, created by white people for a white audience. It's really on
the nose that the fancy lady chihuahua is a white chihuahua. The movie
makes it like Papi is some kind of hero for booking a mariachi band,
instead of a DJ or a reggaeton act. But it's just him doing another
Mexican thing in a Mexican way, and it all gets very tiresome.
Meanwhile, the human Hispanic man has this pointless subplot about
trying to impress the big boss with his landscaping and his hard work
ethic. Sigh. Another criticism is that it depicts Papi as the only character whose
decisions carry consequences. He gets to be the big hero. He dotes on
but also dictates to his daughter. Somehow this incredibly retrograde
view of fatherhood gets a pass because, again, the characters are dogs.The problem I see with these huge stereotypes is that it's aimed at
kids, who in turn will back up problematic racial and gender
stereotypes. The only character I found really amusing was the pug, who
despite still being rather stereotypical himself, at least had some
charm and talked in a vaguely sensible way about things that were going
on. He was an oasis of wit and sense in a movie fully of corny lines
and nonsense. It's not completely without redeeming features. The plot, tired as it

are there, unhappy news arrives at once. The parents are going to lose
their long-held family home unless they can pay the back mortgage
payments. The pair got behind when the father was injured and unable to
do his landscaping job. What are they going to do? In fact, before
long, the whole caboodle are thrown out, due to the puppies creating
havoc on the house and the loan officer. Everyone troops back to the
USA and Aunt Viv's home to think. Fortunately, there is a dog show in
Beverly Hills that week and the prize money would get back the Mexican
house! Can Papi or Chloe win? Also, they once again meet up with
Delgado, a friend from the first film, who needs the huahuas help as
well. Will things work out? Of course! Bow Wow Wow, what a darling
film! This viewer loved the first one and found this one equally fun.
Some of the cast members have changed but, thankfully, Lopez is still
here to do a great Papi. Also, French Stewart, Emily Osment, Morgan
Fairchild and others lend their talents, too. The scenery is wonderful,

just that, but doesn't really succeed. Casting is strong with Goss,
Trejo, Faulhaber. Sloan does a great job but his character doesn't get
much camera-time unfortunately. The action is decent, direction is
good, the writing could be better. The movie looks good, too. The
problem is that there isn't really much of a central character to root
for and for no good reason they decided to film the main part of this
movie at night, which doesn't work all that well with action movies.

somewhat annoying. I did appreciate the sexual tension between her and

1378,8.6,8.0,"By the time Sidney Lumet's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" came around he had
already learned to let Al Pacino loose. Forget the holdbacks of
""Serpico""; here we get a glimpse into the real Al, the actor who would
bring Tony Montana to life in the years to come and the same man who
provided Michael Corleone with such heartfelt warmth that was lacking
in some of his lesser characters.There's essentially the Al Pacino as an actor and the Al Pacino as a
character, and here he's the character, and it works splendidly. Al
Pacino the actor comes into play when he is given a recycled script and
a talentless director, which has been happening a lot lately, although
fortunately his comparison, De Niro, has been lucky enough to generally
avoid these blunders of older-age film-making.This is based on a true story, like ""Serpico,"" only it's better and
more involving. It connects with the audience more than ""Serpico""
because it doesn't jump through the same old hoops; it goes for the
long trek and comes off better than it would have had the team behind
it been lazy. The clichés are gone and the originality creeps in early
on. Watch Pacino indulge himself in character and let the plot sink in.
It's more touching than it seems at first.Pacino is Sonny Wortzik, a Brooklyn man who takes a bank hostage in
order to pay for his ""wife's"" operation. The wife is actually Leon
Shermer (Chris Sarandon who was Oscar-nominated for this, his first
role in a mainstream film), Sonny's gay lover who doesn't have the
money for a sex operation.The bank robbery was going to be what one of classic cinema's greatest
bad guys once described as a quick ""in and out,"" but Sonny gets held up
inside the bank and soon he's all over the news and police are standing
outside the building with guns drawn. It's like Denzel's movie only
better and more original. Oh, and true. This one actually happened and
we can tell.Sonny's partner in crime, Sal (John Cazale), is worried that he'll be
treated as a homosexual by the media outside. His fretting is comic
relief and one of the connections between the film and the audience.
Charles Durning is the frustrated cop handling the situation. His
performance is as subtly convincing as Cavale's.Pacino's performance is exceedingly excellent, manic and energetic.
He'd display this same talent in ""Scarface"" again eight years later;
only he would be bashed by the critics for going over-the-top.
(Although they really just had problems with the excessive profanity
and violence, just like Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" will
soon become a well-known classic and people will laugh when they hear
that someone once called it the most violent film ever made.)There's also one of the best scenes of all time in this movie that
rivals Montana's Last Stand in ""Scarface"" or the Baptism Scene in ""The
Godfather,"" which involves Sonny speaking on the phone to his ""wife,""
carefully concealing his motive from any listeners nearby. Watch Pacino
delve into character here and you're immediately hooked. We like his
character because he seems real and Pacino makes him real, and that's
why this will go down as one of the best tour de force performances of
all time.Is this Hollywood trying to ease our culture onto homosexuality and sex
change operations? Is Hollywood trying to gradually introduce us to gay
characters in the hope that the uptight American families will be
increasingly invaded by the images of gay men? No. This is Hollywood
showing us a true story, regardless of the homosexuality. Pacino could
be playing a frustrated postal worker and it would still work because
it all settles down to the fact that the suspense and dramatics of the
movie affect us, not the background of its characters.Sarandon's Oscar nomination was more than worthy; here he displays the
smarmy talent that would shine through in his characters in the years
to come. Prince Humperdink from ""The Princess Bride"" is equally
memorable but less realistic. Here he seems more real, which is good
for this film and would have been quite bad for ""Bride."" We don't like
real characters in fantasy tales, do we?Lumet, who ruined ""Serpico"" with his bad editing, out-of-place music,
clichéd dialogue/events and unnecessary scenes, directs ""Dog Day
Afternoon"" with style and flair and good pacing and a surprisingly
heartfelt sense of emotion and care. This isn't exactly a good example
of a perfect motion picture but it's pretty close.",125,1975

yes, fall in love; what makes the film great is how mature and honest a

1380,4.0,7.2,"Just watched this and must say it is totally brilliant.Soderbergh has brought us SPALDING GRAY'S FINAL MONOLOGUE with the
film, ""And Everything Is Going Fine"".He compiles what is essentially a final autobiographical testament of
Gray's life using rare footage of his TV interviews, recordings of his
theatrical monologues, and even some footage taken personally by Gray
with his family members.A simple mash-up of such footage gives Gray the oppourtunity to bring
us one final monologue- from the grave- speaking about himself, just as
he loved to do...for our pleasure, and his sanity!!! He truly was the
best monologist, one-man-show and storyteller to ever grace the stage.And Soderbergh- whom directed Gray's Anatomy (Gray's 1996
monologue,which is beautifully shot) and King of the Hill (in which
Gray played the role of Mr. Mungo)- must get props for not succumbing
to the urge of telling Gray's story, but instead appropriately allowing
Gray to tell it himself. Collaborating through selectivity and editing,
Soderbergh plays a role much like the one he did when filming his
earlier monologue.Gray begins this story by discussing the overwhelming influence his
mother had on him...an influence that would consume and eventually take
his life. He continues by talking about his journey to Hollywood,
becoming an actor, his various escapades, his travels to India, the art
of writing and performing monologues, the art of acting, the value of
conversing with the audience and people off the street, his marriage,
keeping secrets, and ending with a recollection of his experience of
being in a major accident, one he would never fully recover from.Throughout this monologue he reflects upon life, living, death, growing
up, sex, love, relationships, experience, creative narcissism,
psychology and the limitations of being human, hardship, depression,
and, most importantly, introspection.On January 10, 2004, after watching the film ""Big Fish"" Spalding Gray
got on the Staten Island Ferry from which he would jump, committing
suicide, as his mother did before him. Gray killed himself as a result
of the major depression that plagued him after the accident he
discusses near the end of the film. I have included this information
here, but Soderbergh decided to omit it from the film. He does this so
we can remember him for what he did in life, as opposed to how he
exited in death. (and because Gray can't tell us the story of his death
from the beyond...if only...) This can be contrasted with the film ""Lenny Bruce - Without Tears"" in
which Fred Baker decided to not only discuss Bruce's tragic death, but
show the photos and video footage of Bruce lying dead naked on his
bathroom floor with a needle in his arm. I do not hold this against
Soderbergh, because I feel that this final testament is true to how
""Spud"" would want to be remembered. He was always one to create his own
myth (as opposed to Bruce who ""kept it real""), and it was only
appropriate for Soderbergh to let Gray tell his own story.Shortly after the middle of the film there are a couple interviews in
which Gray foreshadows his own tragic death. It is clear from the
footage at the end of the film- after the accident- that he never was
able to fully recover from the crash- emotionally or physically- and
that is what drove him to join his Mother, in death.May you RIP Spalding, you will never be forgotten! I'm sure you are
ecstatic that Soderbergh gave you the chance to bring us one last
monologue- your final testament to the world - at least i hope you are.
Thank you for everything you've done to entertain us, I hope you gained
as much from it as we did.A definite 10 out of 10, if you loved Spalding Gray as much as I do,

1383,12.6,6.8,"Although often naive, even crude, the films of King Vidor were
frequently distinguished by their sheer energy and forceful visual
style... As his career progressed, his films became increasingly grand
in terms of narrative scope and visual bravura... Tolstoy and Vidor tell the epic story through a handful of major
characters... As Napoleon Bonaparte prepares to invade Russia, Pierre Bezukhov (Henry
Fonda), an aristocrat so liberal in his views, visits his friend Count
Rostov (Barry Jones) and his radiant, young daughter Natasha (Audrey
Hepburn). They all witness 'those handsome Russian men marching away to
fight, to be killed.'When his father dies, Pierre falls under the spell of the attractive
Helene (Anita Ekberg) and finds himself unable to resist her passionate
response... He marries her even though everybody knows that she's
fooling around on him with Dolokhov (Helmut Dantine).His closest friend, Prince Andrei Bolkonsky (Mel Ferrer), achieves
success as a soldier under General Kutuzov (Oscar Homolka) but returns
wounded, a condition made the worse by the death of his wife in
childbirth...With his own marriage ended by the adultery of his woman, Pierre
introduces the grieving Andrei to Natasha, and the pair fall in love...
But before they can marry, Andrei goes to fight the invading French and
the pacifistic Pierre goes along as an observer The motion picture deals with war and its effect on people... It
contains many marvelous pictorial moments as the colorfully uniformed
regiments marching through the excellent streets of Moscow; snowy
landscapes; a magnificent Ballroom sequence; and most of all,
Napoleon's forces at the epic battle of Borodino; the march on Moscow
and the tragic retreat of Napoleon's army through the Russian winter... Most of the military side of the story takes place in the second half,
and it seems slow to arrive, but the battle of Borodino is fairly well
handled... It is focused (through Pierre's eyes) with long shots of the
invading and retreating French troops...Audrey Hepburn whose boyish figure provided a refreshing antidote to
the film, is lovely as Natasha... Her flaming innocence and blossoming
sensuality set her sweet heart ablaze... This charming spirit, with so
much enthusiasm and romanticism, is full of life and true love...
Hepburn matures from an impulsive, kind-hearted teen-ager, to an
understanding woman who uses her courage and impetuousness to love, to
care, and to serve...Henry Fonda is pure, brave, and noble... He projects with sincerity the
confusion of an honest man caught up in an angry twist of history... He
witnesses the horrific events of war, experiencing days of misery as a
prisoner of war... His remarkable adventures lead him to understand at
least part of the mysteries of life, humanity, love and loyalty...
Pierre is strikingly different from others, with a deep love and esteem
for his country and his sweetheart...Mel Ferrer is the sensitive prince who doesn't come around until he
meets the sweet Natasha... Andrei is intelligent but arrogant... He
ignores the feelings of his wife and fails to carry out his
responsibility as a husband...Vittorio Gassman is the legendary seducer, darkly handsome, sensuous,
magnetic, who lives in a world of debauchery... Anatole is a man
dangerous to love, impossible to resist...Herbert Lom is the 'greatest man of Europe' who sees his men walking
hardly under fatiguing conditions through the snowy fields of Russia...
Napoleon had a tough decision to make... Oskar Homolka is General Kutuzov who forms a reasoned judgment against
an enemy who has a larger, more efficient force... It is unclear
whether he did this out of weakness or whether it was part of a
brilliant strategy with the purpose of drawing Napoleon's army way
beyond their means of supply for the winter, which Bonaparte had not
prepared for...Anita Ekberg is Helene, the charming and reckless libertine who goes to
a world of cheats and insults her husband's ego making his life
depressed and miserable... Helmut Dantine is Dolokhov, the officer, challenged for a duel, who
puts on view the better side of his character much later... Tulio Carminati is Prince Vasili Kuragine, a man of the world who
familiarizes himself with people who are influential and tries to
obtain favor from them...Barry Jones is Count Rostov, a loving family man and an excellent
friend... He is indulgent towards his family and provides them comforts
and luxuries of life...Wilfrid Lawson is Prince Bolkonsky, a despot aristocrat who imposes his
authority on his son without caring for his feelings..May Britt is Sonya, the tender young girl who is devoted to the Rostov
family and loves Nicholas...John Mills is Platon, the cheerful Russian peasant whose philosophies
comfort Pierre... Vidor's 'War and Peace' is massive in scale, faithful to the larger
historical events... Its heart is really with the romantic side and so
it's most successful as a period melodrama...",208,1956

it, but of all the criticisms, the only one that I felt really applied
was the lack of gore. Apart from that, I liked a lot of things about
this one. The thick layers of mid eighties cheese for one thing, as
well as the utterly generic plot gave me a warm, comforting been there,
done that but just keep coming back for more feeling. I found the dream
sequences kinda fun and intriguing, even though they had a lot of
unused potential. The acting was pear for this sort of movie, ie. not
great, but fortunately not grating. Plus there was a little bit of
mindless nudity, which did make me briefly grin. What elevated this
film above being wholly ordinary for me though were the frequent
moments of suspense, and cool, if never very bloody killings. The lack
of much blood annoyed me, as gore was clearly a necessary part of the
film that just seemed to have been left out, but even without it, the
killer set about his business with an almost Michael Myers verve and
dedication, which meant for some good excitement, especially towards
the end. That about sums it up, as far as I can remember. Definitely
recommended, mostly to eighties slasher fans who don't mind there being
not very much gore.",74,1986
1386,12.0,5.7,"Like airline disaster movies, one staple of 1970's cinema that was ripe for
spoofing was the sub-genre of pre-historic melodrama influenced by ""Korg:
1,000,000 B.C.""(1966). Enter, ""Caveman,"" a movie as willing to stick it to
this genre as ""Airplane!""(1980) was willing to do so to the Airport series,
and countlessly similar movies and made-for-TV movies. You won't exactly
find humor on the level of Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Young Ones, or
Daria here, but it's still good for some laughs.Atouk(Ringo Starr) has a huge crush on his tribal leader's wife Lana(Barbara
Bach), but even if he didn't he's severely mistreated by Tonda(John
Matousak), just because he can do so. Tonda is a huge thug who'd rather
allow his fellow tribe-members to get eaten by numerous dinosaurs(which they
call ""Machas""), than try to save them. After he tries to ""zug-zug"" with
Lana, he's kicked out of the tribe, and on the way finds Lar(Dennis Quaid)
who was previously left to die after being injured fleeing a
Macha.Along the way they run into Tala(Shelly Long) and her blind father, Gog(Jack
Gilford) who nearly drowns in a tar pit until Atouk and Lar save him. Tala
immediately falls for Atouk, but he's not interested, which is a shame
because she was gorgeous. Shelley Long has never looked as good as she does
here. If I were in Atouk's position, I'd dump my aloonda for Lana and
zug-zug Tala till she screamed like a Macha, and perhaps even afterwards.

Tonda and his clan for both Ool(food) and pride. Atouk is admired by many
other primitive people he comes across, partially because he discovers fire,
chiropractic medicine, hallucinogenic plants, and rhythm, which is why Starr
is perfect for the role.The big disappointment here is the fact that the DVD has no translation card
of the primitive language, which was originally offered to patrons of the
movie when it was first released. At least they could've made a translation
section as one of the special features. Other than that it was as silly as
hell, and well worth seeing.",91,1981

fifties. Based on the book ""The Vikings"" by Edison Marshall it was
produced by Jerry Brasler for Bryna Productions (Kirk Douglas' own
company which he named after his mother).Beautifully photographed in
Technirama and Technicolor by ace British cinematographer Jack Cardiff
more than 4000 multinational performers and technicians worked on the
giant production. Filmed on actual locations in the mountains and
fjords of Norway the picture is well remembered for its scenic beauty
and authentic sets. The splendid screenplay was put together by Dale
Wasserman and Calder Willingham and Richard Fleischer directed with a
deft hand an all star cast. The picture is also notable for the fine
polished narration spoken by an uncredited Orson Welles. Ragnar (Ernest Borgnine) is the savage Viking chieftain who with his
Viking horde rape and pillage along the English coast. On one such raid
he rapes an English Queen who later gives birth to a boy they call Eric
(Tony Curtis). But his existing son Einar (Kirk Douglas) is unaware he
has a half brother and grows to hate Eric especially after the Vikings
attack an English ship and abduct the princess Morgana (Janet Leigh)
whom both sons desire. Sometime later Eric rescues the princess from
the Viking camp and in a small boat makes a dash for England with
Ragnar and Einar in hot pursuit. During the chase Ragnar's ship goes
aground in the fog but Eric saves him, pulls him aboard and takes him
to England as well where the treacherous king Aella sentences Ragnar to
die in the dog pit. Later Eric returns to Norway to muster Einer and
his men to attack the English castle where Morgana is being held and to
avenge Ragnar's death. The picture ends in a marvellous set piece as
the Vikings take the castle after a blistering well staged battle and
Eric and Einar battle it out to the death in a terrific sword duel atop
the dizzying castle parapets.Performances are superb from the entire cast. Douglas himself is a
standout in his own production. His facility for knockabout action is a
joy to behold. His prowess and unerring skill at stunts is well
revealed in THE VIKINGS exemplified in the taking of the castle
sequence. Here Douglas, under fire from rocks and arrows, charges and
leaps across the open moat grabbing onto the axe handles which his men
had already thrown and embedded in the underside of the raised
drawbridge. Then using the axes to grip he clambers up and over to let
the bridge down. It is a stunning and spectacular piece of stunt work!
Again in an earlier scene Douglas can clearly be seen doing what is
known as Dancing The Oars whereby he hops from oar to oar outside the
ship for the amusement of the camp. Excellent too was Tony Curtis! Here
was the emergence of Tony Curtis the ACTOR which manifested itself in
Burt Lancaster's ""Trapeze"" (1956), with Lancaster again in ""Sweet Smell
of Success"" (1957) and then in ""The Defiant Ones""(1958). Gone were his
pretty boy days at Universal International the studio he started with
and where he would become their top pinup male star alongside a young
Rock Hudson and Jeff Chandler. Also a standout in THE VIKINGS is Ernest
Borgnine giving a powerful portrayal of the Viking leader Ragnar - a
part he was born to play. Others in smaller roles are good too such as
Alexander Knox as the Friar, Frank Thring as the sly and dubious Aella,
James Donald as Egbert the English traitor and Janet Leigh (Mrs. Curtis
at the time) as the princess.My only problem with the movie is the staid and laboured music score by
Italian composer Mario Nascimbene a composer who never really
distinguished himself in anything he did. Despite the haunting and
echoing motif that sings out the two words of the film's title on a
giant elephant tusk the colourless tinny sounding score is quite
insipid and uninspired. It is surprising that a composer the calibre of
Miklos Rozsa or Dimitri Tiomkin - two men who could score such epics in
their sleep - were not approached to work on Douglas' picture. Their
involvement would have added immeasurably to the film giving it a
greater buoyancy and density. However, the score not withstanding THE
VIKINGS is still a great movie and remains one of cinema's finest
blockbuster epics.",116,1958

of booze behind the bar. Horses and men had trouble walking in the snow and
you never knew who was going to kill who, a horse was even killed because it
fell and broke his leg. Burl Ives,(Jack Bruhn) did not sing a song, but
gave orders to his men, and kept them from any women or drink. Bruhn sort
of took over the town and layed the law down and had a bullet removed
without even a drop of booze to ease the pain. Robert Ryan(Blaise Starrett)
was in love with a married woman and managed to leave the town and then
return as a hero. Tina Louise (Helen Crane) was the sweetheart of this film
and Elisha Cook Jr.,""I Wake Up Screaming"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"", was a
barber in this picture, however, you never saw him give a haircut, nor his
usual bulging eyes and nervous looks. Believe it or not, there was some
laughs in this film, especially when the men were allowed to dance with the
few local woman, they went wild and just jumped and threw them all around,
only to try to get a kiss. This is still a classic film and is worth
viewing.",92,1959
1391,14.0,6.2,"Below (*****) I know what you're thinking. A ""B"" picture about a haunted
submarine? And I think it's the best flick I've seen so far this year?
Well, when a ""B"" picture is this smart, this intricate, this well-made, this
damned entertaining, then, yeah, it's the best movie I've seen so far this
year.Here's the set-up: it's 1943 in the North Atlantic, and the U.S.S. Tiger
Shark picks up three survivors from a British hospital ship that was
torpedoed two days earlier; the discovery that one of the survivors is a
German leads to violence; and, then, really weird things start happening,
all the while a German cruiser is chasing the sub down. Is a ghost trying
to destroy the sub and its crew, or are they just imagining things through
convenient coincidences? Below was written by Lucas Sussman, Darren Aronofsky and the film's
director, David N. Twohy; Aronofsky is the smart filmmaker behind the
art-house hit Requiem for a Dream, and Twohy has consistently specialized in
sophisticated ""B"" pictures like The Arrival and Pitch Black. Below offers
up an intricate storyline that keeps both the characters and the audience
guessing--when they and we aren't jumping out of our skins in terror.
Twohy's direction is an example of economic brilliance--the flick charges
forward, piling on the twists and scares methodically, but never
gratuitously--thankfully, this is a horror flick that's more about mood than
about gore--indeed, it's less in tune with modern splatterfests than it is
an homage to the cerebral Val Lewton thrillers of the 1940s (like The
Seventh Victim or Isle of the Dead).And what mood this movie creates! Ian Wilson's cinematography is vibrant
and chilling, and the magnificent special effects never overwhelm the
story--except for a final, hauntingly beautiful shot that will linger in
your memory for quite awhile.An added bonus is the cast of smart players: Bruce Greenwood as the sub
commander trying to hold his crew and himself together; Matt Davis as the
wet-behind-the-ears officer not really accepted by the crew; Olivia Williams
as an English nurse who is both suspect and suspicious; and Holt McCallaney
as a gruff officer. It appears that Below is being dumped by its studio, Dimension, with little
advertising or fanfare; a shame, really, since it's one of the most
sophisticated and highest quality pictures I've seen in quite awhile. [Rated

1393,5.0,7.6,"'It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being.'Set in St. Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans,
""Dead Man Walking"" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon),
a Louisiana nun Sister who befriended Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a
murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing
a teenage couple Sister Helen agrees to help the convict and to remain
with him till the endan act never before attempted by a woman At their first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice
was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new
trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his life The film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the
human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry
bereaved parents whose kids were shot, stabbed, raped, and left in the
woods to die alone As Poncelet's execution looms closer and closer, his character is seen
deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the rightness of what they
were doing to him In one moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a
lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent, in
another we see him furious playing the victim, blaming the government,
drugs, blacks, the kids for being there Poncelet never understood that
he has robbed the Percys and the Delacroixs so much, giving them
nothing but sorrow They are never going to see their children again,
never going to hold them, to love them, to laugh with them In the scenes leading up to his execution, the death-row inmate drops
his terrible facade and reveals his identity Luckily both Sarandon and
Penn are here exceptionalcarrying out successfully an exquisite,
tangible harmony of souls When Sarandon was looking at Penn, she was
projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tears She asks him to
visualize her as he dies ''I want the last thing you see in this world
to be the face of love''in that moment, we truly believed that she'll
be the face of love for him",122,1995
1394,4.333333333333333,5.5,"Edit: I found this to be Boring and a very extremely totally
predictable storyline. As i watched the screen i realised this is
another stereotypical Barbie role, same old goody-two-shoes like in all
the rest of her outdated and strange movies. Why are her movies strange and weird? Here's a list: 1. It's always bothered me and i wonder why does it have to be so black
and white with this girl, every-single-time, without exception? Why is
she so determined to throw herself into danger. People like the modern
reluctant hero, the flawed hero. Not this do-gooder, self obsessed,
from the 60's, who rushes forward into danger even though she may die
in the process. And within 10 minutes of watching a Barbie movie i can
easily figure the entire story out. Why is the ending so obvious.2. People find do-gooders annoying, or suspect do-gooders of being
motivated by some other undesirable reason  like ""everyone look up to
me, look at my squeaky clean image, now go and buy all of my
merchandise."" 3. Every movie is just a rehashed version of the previous one, taking
on all of the world's problems, same old I'm so nice, I'm so kind
ambitious yet irritating woman, taking center stage. 4. But just how inspired should we be by fictional women who alienate
others. Character flaws in movies are admirable, because as human
beings we are flawed and audiences love learning about it, but not
Barbie.5. I don't understand why they don't modern up, move with the times,
look at what other people are doing, like Frozen, Shrek, How To Train
Your Dragon, and look at all the success they are having. 6. I noticed in the papers Barbie sales are plummeting, what is Mattel
doing wrong, according to them: nothing, we are perfect! It's not that
i myself or the people around me are tired of Barbie being a princesses
it's the stories are garbage. Using friendship/ discovering her true
self/ Blah-Blah-Blah Whatever, Barbie defeats all before her and wins. 7. With this movie Barbie Spy Squad there was no inner turmoil or
conflict. I could not find a single reason why I should like any of the
characters, and I didn't. Flat, one-dimensional, don't people have
hobbies,strengths, weaknesses, likes, dislikes, a personality.8. Okay, kids like pets. I get it. But every single movie. Really?
Isn't it time to move on? So tired of seeing some animal crawl on stage
to be greeted with gasps of delight and "" You're so adorable, You're so
cute, You're so cool.""9. I could not find anything new or innovative here, with the gadgets,
Headquarters, laborotories, British boss, etc,it borrows heavily from
old stuff like James Bond Spy Kids Totally Spies etc 10. I didn't know the girls had superpowers, but all the way through
they perform better than any world class gymnast could even dream 11. And finally we have Patricia who decides to become a team player at
the last minute and give up her life of crime  Unbelievable.12. Barbie needs to step up and change, also hire a decent writer who
can craft a story. 13. This doesn't feel like a story to me, very artificial,fake, wrong.
It's like they took Shoes, Dresses, Make Up, (like they do every single
time) and everything else they thought girls could possibly like and
built a story around it. It's too much relying on pandering and very
little talent. Too clichéd also, trite, all this Cool! Wow! Totally!
Excellent! No one really talks like that. 14. All Barbie movies are the same, just a different career or
backdrop, that's why no one is interested in them, why would they when
the other studios are producing way better stuff. Our kids would much
rather buy a PlayStation game than any Barbie merchandise. 15. In the last movie Barbie went on a hunt to find treasure > treasure
found> story ends. 17. This movie Barbie wants to catch a diamond thief > thief gets
caught>story ends. So bland and predictable.",75,2016

1396,9.2,5.9,"Mika Kaurismaki's Queen Christina of Sweden (Malin Buska) is tall,
beautiful, and without a hump on one shoulder, but otherwise she's a
fair representation of the historic figure. In her restless spirit,
intellectual appetite, impatience with the patriarchy and her
lesbianism she's a much more accurate representation than Rouben
Mamoulian's (Garbo in Queen Christina, 1933). Of course Kaurismaki opts to revive the 17th Century Christina story
now because it's a sharp reflection of our times. I don't know how
Swedes or Finns will see their lives in this film, but much of it rings
clear for North America and Europe today. The film bristles with
pertinence, like the male advisor's ""Peace doesn't fill our coffers""
and her ""Austerity is sadistic.""Christina's advocacy of peace, culture, the arts, make her a model for
modern leadership. In her refusal to accept male authority, especially
not to allow any man to claim her as a field he can plow for his
pleasure, she is the prototypal feminist. Sadly, the contemporary also
limns through her ultimate defeat by the male authority and their
rejection of her same-sex passion as ""deviance."" Her male counsellors
conspire against her, drive off her beloved, and drive Christina into
madness, until she escapes. We're still hung up on the questions she poses to Descartes: what is
love, how do we deal with it, how can we free ourselves from it. We
still crave the freedom to define our own destiny and escape our
inherited structures and strictures. If we've moved beyond Descartes'
assumption that our emotions have a physical source, we continue to
build upon his confidence in empirical evidence and in the essential
use of reason. But another Cartesian statement propels the film: To find the truth we
must abandon everything we have learned or assumed and establish a new
understanding of our world. This is the triumph of discovery over
habit, reason over delusion, freedom over ""destiny."" This is how this
Christina constantly flies in the face of what she has been taught and
what is expected of her. Her escape is ironic. Her advisors having long insisted she marry to
produce a clear heir to the throne, she now proclaims one suitor her
son and bestows upon him her royal authority. With a quarter of the
treasury she departs to Rome, where she converts to Catholicism and
enjoys the life of secular culture and stimulation she has craved. As
one counsellor bitterly observes, having rejected all her male suitors
she settles into life under the authority of the Pope. The last shots,
however, play her as exulting in openness, freedom and the light the
Swedish court and ""thinkers"" denied her. She abandons her throne and
power to recreate herself in Rome. Now, here's the crowning irony. Mika and younger brother Aki Kaurismaki
are famous for acerbic contemporary stories about inarticulate, hard
drinking, ugly and lugubrious losers, steeped in 1950s rock and roll.
Nobody in a blind test would guess The Girl King is a Kaurismaki film.
But here the director does what his heroine does and what her
healthiest mentor, Descartes, prescribed. To find the truth, to see how
Queen Christina reflects upon our current reality, Kaurismaki discarded
his customary period, his familiar genres and his signature style, then
and bathos  to make something completely new. And true to our day as
it is to his subject's.",106,2015

1398,8.25,7.1,"Hollywood can't seem to get enough of dead female English writers. Hot
on the heels of Miss Potter, and in advance of films about the Brontes,
we have this romantic confection about Jane Austen's youthful fling
with Irish barrister Tom Lefroy.There have already been howls of criticism from outraged Janeites that
the film is historically inaccurate. It's true that English teachers
will have a fit at some elements of the story: at best speculative and
unsubstantiated, at worst downright erroneous. The filmmakers
admittedly didn't have a lot of historical material to work from. The
true background to the story is contained in a couple of letters
written by Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra, and an admission by Tom
Lefroy in old age that he had once been in 'boyish love' with the
writer. On this slightly shaky platform, the filmmakers have built a
story of repressed passion and defiance of social mores that is a work
of fiction worthy of a novel in its own right.This doesn't really matter. Nobody in their right mind would ever
accept the version of events presented by a Hollywood biopic as
historical gospel. The only viewers who will be taken in by the story
seen here will be those who are too lazy, too uninterested or too
credulous to do the modicum of research needed to find out the real
facts, and who cares what such people think? This film may be largely
untrue, but what really matters is whether it works on its own terms,
qua film.Unfortunately, it doesn't, or at least not entirely. The main reason
for this is the underlying premise. It is implied that without Jane and
Tom's youthful affair Jane Austen would never have written her six
great novels, and in particular (perhaps because it's the most familiar
to audiences) Pride and Prejudice. We see Jane angrily destroying a
juvenile story criticized by Tom, and later, in the throes of love,
bashing out the first draft of P & P (in a single night, which shows an
impressive turn of speed). It's plain that, as Tom tells her,
'experience is vital'.The same clunkingly literal idea  that an artist must experience
emotions in order to write about them successfully - underscored
Shakespeare in Love, but there it was handled with a rather lighter
touch. Here we are asked to believe that Pride and Prejudice was not a
distillation of all Jane Austen's youthful experiences enlivened by a
vivid imagination, a sharp sense of humour and a dollop of literary
genius, but the next best thing to a true story. The reasons for this
approach are obvious: cinema can dramatize Johnny Cash learning the
guitar, or Picasso experimenting with paint, but the spectacle of a
writer sitting at a desk dreaming and scribbling palls pretty rapidly.The irony of a film that takes such wild liberties with the facts
relying upon this trite old idea would certainly have been apparent to
Jane Austen, whose mastery of irony is emphasized rather unsubtly
throughout. Moreover, it's intellectually dishonest; lacking the
ability to create a Mr Darcy, the filmmakers borrow freely from Jane
Austen's characterisation in creating Tom, and thereby cheekily suggest
that the author was the one who lacked the imagination to make such a
person up.These reservations aside, does the film have anything going for it?
Yes. The script has some witty moments and at least makes a decent stab
at realistic 18th century dialogue. Ireland is a surprisingly effective
and gorgeous substitute for Hampshire, and the autumnal palette of
washed-out greens and greys is appropriately sombre. Anne Hathaway is
an attractively skittish and impetuous Jane, and she has excellent
chemistry with James McAvoy, whose performance as Tom, by turns
mercurial and obsessive, is well up to his usual high standards.
Reliable support comes from James Cromwell, Julie Walters, the late
great Ian Richardson and Maggie Smith, who essentially reprises her
character from Gosford Park. The problem is that the lovers' behaviour
never really convinces us that this relationship was the foundation of
Jane Austen's later literary success, and ultimately peters out into a
series of implausible endings, the number of which gives Hot Fuzz and
The Return of the King a run for their money. Becoming Jane isn't an
awful film, but it doesn't make the grade as a Regency Brief Encounter.",120,2007

one of survival and redemption and the picture fleshes out Widmark's

trail savvy outsider who must bring to safety folks who dislike him
because of his reputation. The film has fine action scenes but tends to
dwell on the attitudes of the young whites who resent being dependent
on Widmark, yet realize they need him to pull them out of harm's way.
Felicia Farr is good as the woman who falls for Widmark in spite of his

Occasionally you'll come across such a piddling, unknown and unloved
film, which surpasses some blockbusters in terms of content and design.
But ""Weaponized"" is the first crap movie this year. I had a hard time
watching it till the end. Actually everything is wrong in this
monstrosity of a movie. There's absolutely no logic, performances are
pitifully poor and the special effects are so bad it would be better
they skipped it. This is an example that you realize afterwards that
the idea wasn't so bad (even though it was used several times), but
they screwed it up big time due to incompetence. I wonder why actors
like Tom ""Private Ryan"" Sizemore and Mickey Rourke participated. For
those two it's a sign on the wall.It all starts with a terrorist attack on the Pentagon (with really
awful special effects used on historical footage of the Pentagon). The
son of Kyle Norris (Tom Sizemore), CEO of the company Black Sun, dies
during this attack. This incident makes Kyle an avid supporter of the
fight against terrorism. He wants to use the technology developed by
his company, with the assistance of Clarence Peterson (Mickey Rourke),
for this fight. This technique allows a soldier to briefly take over
the consciousness of an opponent, so this person can eliminate himself
and other terrorists. Subsequently it turns out this technology is
being misused (who would have seen this one coming?) and it's time to
bring in detective Mitch Walker (Johnny Messner) so he can save his
family, humanity and the entire universe from a possible dictatorship.
Intriguing, exciting and original? Nope!It all sounds pretty Orwellian and the idea could have been the base of
a vibrant, entertaining action-SF. What we get however, is a bland,
uninspired, nugatory story, stuffed with hackneyed events, horribly
choreographed action scenes set in a fake scenery. There was even at
the beginning of the film a military vehicle that was made out of
cardboard, according to me. The story is a mishmash of story lines,
that were used already in several movies, linked together in a random
way. It wouldn't surprise me that they have organized a raffle to pick
any possible storyline and knit it all together. And what the heck was
that tin robot doing there in the end? Firstly it looked terribly
old-fashioned. Robots in ""Robot Overlords"" looked more high-tech
compared to this. Secondly, the way it was eliminated, is too
ridiculous for words. And why was it displayed in a prominent place on
the poster, since it contributed absolutely nothing to the story?I can be brief about the acting : painfully poor and extremely boring.
Johnny Messner looks impressive when you look at him, but acting is his
weakest side. Sizemore tries to be the bad guy, but this attempt was
only partially successful. And I don't know where they dug up Rourke.
He looked extinct and deathlike anyway. The most ridiculous part can be
admired in the end. Despite they have to deal with a rather large
organization that possesses a life-threatening, demonic weapon, the
amount of troops rushing in at the denouement, is truly laughable. A
collision with a pedestrian ensures that more police will show up.
Luckily it was going towards the end of the movie, because the urge to
throw a heavy object at my TV screen, grew rapidly.Should you read somewhere ""Weaponized"" is an action-packed SF with a
superb quality of images and sound effects, you can be sure that person
has watched this film with an overdose of Prozac in his blood. Even
watching for hours at leaves fluttering down while staring through a

Bill Patterson's character is trying to deal with (the best thing that
could have happened to him, really) and his catharsis so delicately
drawn, that the film is so satisfying. Many of my friends could not

revisions and the editing room floor.Generally the cliché laden dialog, technical writing problems, and

total of 12 minutes of a few smiles and giggles, your butt is going to
be blistered with frustration.Sisters is not a bad movie! It isn't an unfunny movie. It's a good
movie but - for me - Amy Poehler, Tina Fey just didn't pull the laughs
out of the bag as they do in skits on television. Plus it's two hours
long and all you get out of that two hours is occasional smiles &
giggles. You get tired of sitting and waiting for the big moment of
really laughing, which unfortunately never showed up. The big long
party scene becomes just that - too long - and the sight gags and
shenanigans of the 40 plus year old participants never jells into fun
for the viewer.Sorry but this flick is just another example of Hollywood cashing in on
hot popularity. This time it's the team of Amy Poehler & Tina Fey being
offered, no doubt, a fantastic payoff to appear in a rather bloated
production of a very thin plot line of a story.I'm sure it will be on DVD very soon!",118,2015

1409,7.0,7.4,"The War Room does a good job of extolling the skills of James Carville
and George Stephanopolous. Clearly, their work had much to do with
Clinton's victory. A little known fact about the film is that the
actual campaign manager, David Wilhelm, refused to participate in it.
He didn't like the idea of a camera crew roaming the headquarters and
recording conversations that he felt should have been private. Clinton
overruled him, of course. As a result, the documentary skews history a
bit. The nuts and bolts of running a campaign are ignored while the
craft of spin doctoring is glorified. In a visual medium, that's not
altogether surprising, and it may even have been unavoidable. But the
misrepresentation -- or rather, the selective representation -- has had
the unintended consequence of contributing to public cynicism about
political campaigns, which now appear to be all about the spin, the
framing -- the very things that make voters feel like they're being
manipulated. Perhaps a stronger emphasis on the heavy lifting of
door-to-door canvassing, phone banking, meetings with interest groups,
outreach to local officials, event set-up, and the like, would have
given a more complete picture. Then again, those aren't exactly
telegenic activities, and documentary filmmakers may have been
hard-pressed to incorporate them even if Wilhelm had cooperated. But
the troublesome implications remain, and are worth considering.",96,1993
1410,7.5,5.7,"The Hallow or The Woods as it is otherwise known is a UK/Irish
collaboration. Its by no means a mainstream horror flick, yet, in spite
of its humble credentials, its actually not half bad. The scares in The Hallow come on on quite early and linger till ""after""
the closing credits. This should make the impatient viewer quite happy.
There is a nominal amount of ratcheting up the tension in this film
which is followed by an abundance of reasonably well executed creature
scares. The creatures themselves tap into a supposedly Irish mythology
about spirits and fairy like creatures that ""assimilate"" those who
violate their forest haven. There's a lot to like here. The setting is suitably creepy, the premise
is well established and convincing. What's also refreshing is the
couples very sane reaction when confronted with the creatures, that is,
to run like hell. Perhaps the only downside to this film, I felt, was its early
introduction of the monsters. I believe this film would have been more
effective with a more gradual application of tension and maybe another
ten-fifteen minutes run time. That said, The Hallow still hits all the right horror buttons and does
so in a convincing and creative manner. Eight out of ten from me.",97,2015

ways to achieve his goals. I'm not sure why it's also categorized as a
comedy because you won't laugh one bit. It's more a crime story with a
lot of drugs and a narrating voice describing what to do to make it in
the music industry. It's entertaining to watch. Steven is a
narcissistic person, addicted to fancy drugs, and doing everything it
takes to make it to the top. There are no likable characters in the
movie but that's not the point. They are all career driven and very
egoistic. Since it is about the music industry you have a lot of tunes,

1413,4.5,6.6,"Both J.M. Coetzee's novel and its film adaptation leave their audience
wanting more answers. Disgrace is a confronting and brutal tale of life
in modern South Africa. The message is clear. There are no simple
solutions.Literary academic David Lurie's admiration of Byron seems to have
formed his personal morality and his professional ethics.His amorality leads to a doomed relationship that precipitates both
work and identity crises. His alienation from university colleagues and
students results in a refusal to defend his reputation or his
professorial position.He is not the victim of an old fool's infatuation but the arrogance of
a serial Casanova. He quotes William Blake as his sole defence, ""Sooner
strangle an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires."" His
retreat to his daughter's remote farm entangles their individual
problems in the realities of life in the post apartheid era.Director Steve Jacobs and screenwriter Anna Maria Monticelli continue
their professional and personal partnership as co-producers. Their
earlier collaboration on La spagnola in 2001 was another Australian
production that is a minor gem.John Malkovich's ability to convey complete self absorption and intense
self doubt without dialogue make him an excellent choice for David.
Relative newcomer Jessica Haines plays his daughter Lucy. Hers is a
competent and moving performance. Eriq Ebouaney strikes the right tone
in a difficult role as Petrus, the black farmer and her co-landholder.Disgrace is an adaptation that more than does justice to the novel.
Like the book, it does not sensationalise or over-dramatise this
extremely difficult story. I had misgivings before the screening
because the novel seemed so bleak. Lucy's compromise and David's
acceptance of her decision offer such slim hope.We are left with little doubt that this is an allegory for the issues
facing modern multi-racial South Africa. Yet it is at the personal
level that the film is most powerful.Kevin Rennie Cinema Takes http://cinematakes.blogspot.com",119,2008

1415,4.333333333333333,6.1,"In Australia in 1977 we were in the boom years and love affair with
colour TV. Most cinema releases movies at the box office dropped dead..
and most were very good... or at least interesting.... VALENTINO was
one of them. A wildly ambitious and quite well imagined 1920s fiction
on Valentino's career and loves, this Ken Russell pic has spectacular
imagery and hilarious casting (Huntz Hall as the head of Paramount) but
as usual in a Russell film was seriously derailed by grotesque sexual
moments. The film has a great sense of time and place and with great
female casting, spectacular dance scenes and breathtaking art direction
VALENTNO gives the viewer 2 hours of lavish early 20s Hollywood life.

seen to be believed anyway. Some cinemas of the time (well, mine
anyway) ran it as a double feature with NEW YORK NEW YORK and found the
same audience enjoyed both... even if they needed a meal break and a
walk around the block to get through this 5 hour musical fruit salad.

1416,12.0,7.4,"I have this theory about the horror films of Val Lewton. It is my contention
that these movies caused a sea change in the content and tone of the movies
of Alfred Hitchcock. The reason I say this is simple, really: Lewton is the
only filmmaker I have ever caught Hitchcock cribbing scenes from. He did it
twice. Once from The Seventh Victim (dir. by Mark Robson), which I swear to
god provides the first half of the Shower Scene from Psycho. The second from
Cat People, which provided the pet store scene in The Birds. This second
scene is almost a shot for shot swipe. Both of these steals are evidence
that Hitch knew and admired the Lewton movies. More than that, though, there
is a change in the subtext of Hitchcock's thrillers after the Lewton movies.
The movies he made before them were cut from the Fritz Lang mold of
political thrillers. After the Lewton movies, Hitch's movies became more
psychosexual in nature. Vertigo, for instance, could easily fit into
Lewton's output.Cat People is the first of the Lewton movies and sets the tone for them. It
pretends to be about a McGuffin (serbian were -panthers), but is actually
about something else (in this case, frigidity and repressed lesbianism).
This represents a huge change in the evolution of the horror movie. Cat
People is the first horror movie to explore these themes as central concerns
rather than as sub-rosa undercurrents. It also pioneered the techniques of
film noir (which as a genre didn't really exist yet). Cat People is
strikingly stylized and its effect is of stranding the viewer in the middle
of a darkened room with some dreadful beast circling just outside his sphere
of perception. This has a hell of an impact--particularly if you have the
good fortune to see this in a theater. I'm not going to claim that Cat People
is one of the best horror movies ever made (it does have flaws), but it is
one of the four most influential horror movies ever made (along with The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Psycho, and Night of the Living Dead). But unlike
its brethren, its influence spreads corrosively through the entirety of
cinema through both film noir and the films of Alfred Hitchcock. You would
be hard pressed to find any film short of Citizen Kane or Rashomon that is
nearly as influential.",73,1942
1417,14.0,7.4,"The story of Lina ""Monkey - face"" Aysgard and her husband Johnny is
from a novel by Francis Iles called BEFORE THE FACT. Hitchcock liked
Iles' novels, which were unusual because the heroes were actually
anti-heroes. Johnny is an upper class wastrel who is not unwilling to
swindle or kill if it benefits himself. He is responsible, actually,
for at least three deaths in the story. Interestingly enough, Hitch
always wanted to do Iles' ""Black Comedy"" novel MALICE AFORETHOUGHT, as
a film - possibly with Alex Guiness - wherein the anti-hero Dr. Bickley
(based on Dr. Crippen and Major Herbert Armstrong) poisons his wife and
several others in a charming little village in the English countryside.
Unfortunately, Hitch never got to do MALICE AFORETHOUGHT (but it has
been done on BBC television once or twice).He had just pocketed the ""Oscar"" (for the only time in his career, by
the way) for REBECCA - his first American film. Hitch apparently
thought he could do anything. He was now to discover he could not do
everything.To begin with, Iles' novel ended with Johnny facing the loss of his
wife (but in a curious switch - Lina willingly takes the poison he
brings her, and actually destroys him emotionally because Johnny was
secretly ashamed of this crime - he really loved Lina and she kills
herself to help him out). If the Hays and Breen offices had any
imagination they would have realized that the film would have been so
far better and more moral if they had left the ending alone. Johnny
would have been too cowardly to ever kill himself, and would have gone
to his grave realizing what he threw away. It would have been a worse
punishment than if Johnny had been hanged.But the censors would have none of it. If Lina died Johnny must be
punished. Hitch played around with changing the ending (he did this
frequently in his adaptations of novels). He would have had Lina write
a note to her mother, explaining that she knew Johnny was going to kill
her, but she loved him and would let him. Johnny would poison her with
her evening milk, and then (while happily whistling) post the letter to
her mother (Dame May Witty).Here he came acropper with another portion of the Hollywood scene: Cary
Grant's agent and RKO Studio. Both were very image conscious, but that
image was comic or dapper or likable - but not murderous. Grant himself
would have enjoyed the change (ten years later he might have tried to
do it with Hitch that way*). But in 1941 too many interested parties
were opposed. As a result, Grant's part had to be rewritten. (*A few years later, Grant appeared in MR. LUCKY, as a gambler who
decides to commit a fraud regarding a war effort charity. He does use
violence several times in the film, but he reforms against his partner
in the fraud - though he violently kicks him in a fight - and ends up
enlisting in the army. That and his role as Ernie in NONE BUT THE
LONELY HEART were the two closest negative parts he had after
SUSPICION, and neither is a total villain.)Johnny remains a charming wastrel, who loves gambling, and who depends
on others to pay for him. But he is struggling to try to go legitimate,
and in his best scene in the film (when he is trying to get financing
from Nigel Bruce for a building project) he shows a sense of reality
that is just missing from most of the film. He turns on Joan Fontane,
who thinks Grant is planning something crooked at the expense of his
friend Bruce and begins ""gumming up the works"" of his business deal.
Actually one sees there what the film might have been like, but it was
a rare moment of real juice in the movie.Grant does as well with the part as he can, as does Fontane (who won
the Best Actress Oscar award). But it is a hollow victory in the film.
Best are Nigel Bruce as Beaky Thwaite, Johnny's close, doomed friend
(and in the novel his victim). Also in a brief role is Leo G. Carroll
as Johnny's cousin and employer who is swindled by him. Carroll only
has one brief scene, but is memorable as one of the few outsiders who
calls Johnny's character correctly.In later years, after he showed his box office success, Hitch would be
able to make his central figures negative ones. As pointed out
elsewhere on this thread, Joseph Cotton would be ""Uncle Charlie"" the
murderer in SHADOW OF A DOUBT within two years. Later on he would do
THE PARADINE CASE, where defendant Alida Valli was guilty, and STAGE
FRIGHT, where suspect Richard Todd lies partially about the crime to
the audience at the start.I have one particular complaint. Johnny borrows a volume from the
Notable British Trial series from a neighbor who is a mystery novelist.
It is the trial of a 19th Century poisoner who once killed a victim by
betting the victim that he could drink a bumper of brandy without
stopping for breath. This (when Fontane hears of it) resembles the
death of Bruce. This actually happened in the 1850s to a notorious
poisoner who was a gambler. He was Dr. Palmer of Rugeley. And there is
a volume of the Notable British Trial series about Palmer. But it was
Dr. WILLIAM Palmer historically. In the movie the volume is clearly
labeled THE TRIAL OF RICHARD PALMER. Somebody did not do their research
properly",99,1941

to do with the tremendous cast of this movie. The Big Short has a large
ensemble cast but focuses on four major players who benefited in
various ways from betting against the American economy. Steve Carell
gives one of the best performance of his career, Christian bale
portrays the awkward lonely genius with ease. Ryan gosling is slick

the road movie. There is nothing extra in this movie. Every word every
action is meaningful. I wish more directors today would study Sam
Fuller. It seems that only Quentin Tarantino ever heard of Sam.The premise of this film is a little unlikely- Korea early in the war
and one infantry platoon is assigned to hold off three Chinese and
North Korean Divisions while the rest of the U.S. Division regroups.
While it is more likely that a larger US force would have had such an
assignment the small number of men comprising a single platoon makes
for some real character development. There are some great characters
here. Fuller wrote some real life into them. I believe Fuller was a
combat vet from WWII so he knows what he writes- the fear, the rage,
the fear again. There are lots of nice little bits here- the frozen
foot while holding up in a cave. No one is sure whose foot it is that
is being revived as all their feet are frozen. I had to throw another
log in the woodstove after that scene.If you are interested in war movies without flag waving and corny

1422,11.833333333333334,4.8,"The plot: A writer on a publicity tour stops in a small town and finds
creative inspiration in the mysterious happenings.Twixt is about the creative process. If you're put off by Coppola's
more indulgent films, then you're simply not going to like this one,
either. Early on, it becomes apparent that this is going to be a
postmodern take on Gothic tales: the film opens with a hokey narration,
the town is full of quirky stock characters, and the ""real world""
sequences play out like an interactive story. As the film progresses,
these elements grow stronger, and a surreal element breaks down the
barriers between reality, dreams, and fiction. This may leave some
viewers exasperated or confused, as it's a far more experimental and
indulgent story than something like, say, The Godfather or Bram
Stoker's Dracula. What we see is a writer trying to deal with writer's
block, guilt over his daughter's death, and how to make sense of the
jumble of ideas that he's got in his head. Coppola seems uninterested
in telling a straight-ahead Gothic story about a homicidal priest vs
vampires, but I think this is the story that audiences wanted. They're
unconcerned with the creative process, themes in Edgar Allan Poe's
work, or metafiction.There are many beautiful shots in the film that make use of digital
effects. Val Kilmer wanders through his dreams in a black and white
world that makes occasional use of striking, bold colors. The effect is
similar to the semi-monochrome of Sin City, though it's used more
sparingly. Unfortunately, as striking as the cinematography is, it
doesn't really live up to the legendary expectations that many have
come to expect from Coppola. Like Scorsese, he seems to have became a
victim of his own early success, doomed to be forever judged harshly
for anything that falls short of pure genius.Val Kilmer is obviously looking a bit older, and, yes, he's gained some
weight. Regardless, I found his performance to be pretty good. I was
never a huge fan of Kilmer, but he's a likable guy, and he imbues this
character with the same likable qualities. His performance is a bit
muted and introspective, but there are occasional hammy moments, such
as when he does some rather amusing impressions during a drunken scene
of writer's block. Bruce Dern was really great, and I loved his
character, a spunky and reactionary sheriff who served as the foil for
Kilmer's character. Dern got to be as eccentric and lively as Kilmer
was quiet and repressed, and it was fun to see them work off each
other. The others were good, but Dern was just so much fun that I kept
wishing he'd show up in every scene, do something crazy, and keep the
film a bit more lively.For fans of Edgar Allan Poe, Gothic horror, and literary analysis, this
is a fun film. Others will probably be a bit disappointed. The pacing
is significantly faster than Coppola's 70s work, but it's still a bit
leisurely, and the lack of a coherent narrative may alienate people who
just wanted to see vampires vs serial killers in a small town full of
secrets.",88,2011

kindness to his boy, and father and son depart for their farm...One day, Calder sees Kay and gambler Harry Weston (Rory Calhoun) in
trouble on a raft in the river near his home... He helps them ashore
and learns that Watson is in a hurry to get to town to register a gold
claim... So eager is he that he steals his rescuer's only horse, and

on a rampage and are due to attack the farm at any moment... The only

minutes later, the same film is strangely billed as THE HEAD THAT
WOULDN'T DIE in the end credits. That gives you an idea of how much
effort went into this '60s schlockfest.But that doesn't mean it's not worth watching if you're in the right
mood. Jason Evers (who would later lend his considerable talents to
such memorable efforts as A PIECE OF THE ACTION and A MAN CALLED
GANNON) stars as a wacky doc who thinks it'd be just super to keep his
fiancée's head alive in his laboratory after her untimely decapitation
in a car accident. He's understandably not content marrying a head, so
he seeks out an appropriate (though not necessarily willing!) body
donor.Much of the ""action"" takes place in the mad doc's basement lab (likely
marking one of the final times the traditionally cheesy horror film lab
set was put to use). Jan Compton (Virginia Leith), or Jan in the Pan as
she's called, spends an awful lot of time yapping and whining. Another
IMDb reviewer wasn't far off when he likened her to THE HEAD THAT
WOULDN'T SHUT UP! Can you blame her? She's understandably not content
to live this sort of life. But what's really holding her interest (and
mine... there, I admitted it) is the doctor's other monstrous creation,
which keeps trying to pound its from behind its single-doored prison.
Will our hero find a body for his woman? Are the authorities on to him?
Why am I enjoying this so much? Those are just some of the questions

interest with its outrageous plot and suspense built up over the
creature behind the door. Sure it goes on a bit too long and sure there
are dull moments, but what did you expect?Admit it. If you haven't seen this one, at least part of you wants to.

the dead for three days. Some people have all the luck!This is a great wee story with all the trademarks of what made Hammer
films so spellbinding in the first place. A remote location, strange
locals, an abundance of gloomy weather and of course blood and guts
aplenty. The tale twists and weaves, there's a number of interesting
plot twists and fantastic performances all round especially from Spall
who puts more proof in the pudding he is one of the most versatile
British actors around. Debutant Ella Connolly playing the couple's
tragic daughter is superb as well.The script is original something difficult to muster in the horror
genre nowadays. There is every chance 'Wake Wood' will end up becoming
a cult classic in the same vein as 'The Wicker Man. Here's hoping it
does because on first viewing it certainly deserves such an accolade.",90,2009
1430,10.0,6.2,"While this film is not without it's flaws, it is definitely worth
seeing. I found the dialogue hard to distinguish at times, and the plot
line takes a little sorting out but the visuals work to stunning
effect. It is a film that evokes a visceral (not to say gut-wrenching)
response; one that brings the viewer much closer to understanding the
nerve-jangling, terrifying experience of war, and the fortitude
required to endure it.Grierson's starting point are the words of the Isurava Memorial. It was
the 'courage, mateship, endurance and sacrifice' of the boys and men of
the 39th, 2/14th and 2/16th battalions, that bound these ordinary
individuals together into a force stronger than the combined effects of
their circumstances and the Japanese army.The film is graphic in its depiction of the demands that that
environment makes upon you physically. Though while watching it you
might not feel the strength sapping jungle humidity or smell the stench
of battle and its aftermath, you're left in no doubt about the
challenges placed on human bodies by dysentery and malaria. This is no glorification of war, but its grim and gritty reality.
Seeing the film will help you appreciate the efforts of those who were
there.",0,2006

Quinn), and Éamon de Valera (Alan Rickman) are among the captured
rebels in the Easter Rising. After being released, they are politically
active. De Valera and the political leadership get arrested. Collins is
tipped off by double agent police detective Ned Broy (Stephen Rea).
Collins goes into hiding with his best friend Boland. He meets his love
Kitty Kiernan (Julia Roberts). Collins and Boland lead a guerrilla war
against the British forces. De Valera takes Boland with him to work
diplomatically. Eventually, the Brits relent and De Valera sends
Collins to negotiate. Collins returns with home rule and splitting off
Northern Ireland with De Valera opposing him. In 1922, the Anglo-Irish
Treaty is approved. De Valera and his men resign taking Boland with
them. They start their own revolt against the Irish Free State Army
headed by Collins.This is an expansive epic historical drama. Liam Neeson leads this with
his powerful presence. He looms over this movie like the leading man
that he is. The actors are all great although Julia Roberts does stick
out a little. It would have been more fitting to have an Irish lass.
The movie does try to fit a lot into two hours. Some of it can feel a
bit disjointed. Liam Neeson is big enough to tie it all together. It
would also be nice for him to have a constant foil. Whether or not he
deserves it historically, the movie seems to make De Valera Collins'
foil. It would be great to fully embrace the conflict and give De
Valera more screen time. Make this Collins versus De Valera.",133,1996
1432,11.8,6.5,"""You know what they say about cops and donuts"" quips Salma Hayek's
character Martha Beck to James Gandolfini in the movie Lonely Hearts,
""they're only good when they have a hole in them."" This, coupled with
Gandolfini's retort ""funny, they say the same thing about women"",
captures the essence of the Chandler-esquire dialog that peppers this
true crime homage to film noir.The movie tells the story of Raymond Fernandez (Jared Leto) and Martha
Beck who carved out their own chapter in the annals of crime history
during the 1940s as the Lonely Hearts Killers. Together, Fernandez and
Beck ran a con game using personal ads to seek out wealthy widows and
single women with money. Fernandez would engage in correspondence with
the women, eventually meeting them and gaining their trust as well as
access to their money. Beck, would accompany him posing has his sister,
helping Fernandez gain the trust of their victims, whom the two
murdered after they'd drained their bank accounts. At the time of their
capture, the body count they'd racked up was estimated at between 12
and 20.Directed by Todd Robinson, the grandson of detective Elmer Robinson
(played by John Travolta), the story alternates between that of
Fernandez and Beck, and pursuing detectives Robinson and Hildebrandt
(Gandolfini), with Gandolfini handling the connecting voice-over
narration in traditional film noire patter.Although some details are condensed for narrative purposes, the story
largely sticks to the facts of the couple's actual murder spree, the
only glaring discrepancy being the casting of Hayek as Beck, who in
reality was a rotund, unattractive, battleaxe of a woman who maintained
Fernandez's loyalty by granting his every sexual wish. The producers
can be forgiven for opting to cast Hayek instead of a more credible
Rosie O'Donnell type, however, as Hayek brings more than mere eye-candy
to her role. She plays a sadistic, manipulative, cold-blooded murderer
to the hilt, and practically serves as the driving engine for the
film's story.With a crackerjack cast of Travolta, Gandolfini, Hayek, Leto and Laura
Dern (as Robinson's love interest) all bringing their A-game, coupled
with a smartly written screenplay, snappy dialog, good pacing,
excellent cinematography and direction, the only oddity about this film
is that it was relegated to limited theatrical release, largely playing
a few festivals before being relegated to DVD. Unlike the case it is
based on, this is one crime that probably will remain unsolved.",108,2006

it's teen film genre. While people will cite better time-travel themed
movies like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Back o the Future,
this one will certainly stand on its own due to the Twilight Zone
quality of it. Great visuals, great idea, and the story didn't try to
insult it's audience by making the story painfully obvious. I especially liked Mike's character, a kind of good guy that was a
diamond stuck in the pond scum. Unfortunately, his entire performance
was stepped on by Fisher Steven's over the top performance. Dennis
Hopper made a perfect cameo performance that really fit his bi-polar
acting style.While this film won't be considered one of the elite teen films of the
1980s like The Breakfast Club, Bill and Ted, River's Edge, Say
Anything, Sixteen Candles and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but it will fit
comfortably with the silver medalists of that area, much like Can't Buy

1434,3.0,6.6,"I remember seeing this movie back in the late 80's, when I was young,
and I have fond memories of it being a great and fun movie. And sure
enough, having sat down again here in 2012 and watch it again, the
movie was every bit as funny and entertaining and I remembered it to
be.But of course, why wouldn't it? You have two of the greatest comedians
in American cinema in it; Dan Aykroyd (playing Roman) and John Candy
(playing Chet), and they were really a great comedian couple,
complementing each other well and having great on-screen chemistry.The story in ""The Great Outdoors"" is about the Ripley family coming to
a very idyllic and beautiful cabin site, where Chet's father used to
take Chet when he was a child, and now Chet want his children to have
their own memories of this paradise. But within only moments of getting
there, Chet's brother Roman and his family show up unannounced to
surprise the Ripley's and spend a week of vacation together.The movie is filled with great and memorable moments that will have you
laughing hard, because Aykroyd and Candy really do some great comedy in
this movie and put on great performances. Sure it is very 1980's in
spirit, but still today the movie is fun and entertaining to watch. And
I personally never will tire of John Candy and his greatly missed
comedy act, he was truly one of a kind.If you enjoy 80's comedies and the movies of Dan Aykroyd and/or John
Candy, then I am sure you are already well familiar with ""The Great
Outdoors"", but if you aren't, then get your hands on this movie,
because it is well worth a watch.",91,1988
1435,4.5,6.7,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""There's air freshener behind the
Virgin"". That line should provide the necessary caution for you to be
braced for just about anything to be said by any character in this
latest from director Nicholas Hytner. Billed as ""A mostly true story"",
it's actually more commentary on how we treat those less fortunate and
how we use others for our own gain. That bleak message is cloaked here
in humor and a wonderful performance from Dame Maggie Smith.Alan Bennett is an author, playwright and screenwriter known for The
History Boys and The Madness of King George (Oscar nominated for his
script). He is also at the core of this story  every bit as much as
Ms. Shepherd, the lady in the van. While living in upper crust Camden
Town, Mr. Bennett offered to let Ms. Shepherd park her van in his
driveway for a few weeks until she could make other arrangements. This
van was also her home, and the years (as they are apt to do) came and
went until this arrangement had lasted 15 years (1974-1989).You might assume that Ms. Shepherd was an extremely appreciative
""squatter"", but in fact, she was quite a cantankerous and difficult
woman, possibly/probably suffering from mental instability. Maggie
Smith brings a humanity to the role that she had previously owned
onstage and radio. She goes far deeper than the wise-cracking old lady
role we have grown accustomed to seeing her play  though her vicious
dialogue delivery remains in prime form. Throughout the film, we
assemble bits and pieces of Ms. Shepherd's background: an
educated-French speaking musician-turned nun-former ambulance
driver-who ""possibly"" won awards for her talents. She is also carrying
a burden of guilt from a past tragic accident that keeps her in the
confessional on a consistent basis.Mr. Bennett is played by Alex Jennings (The Queen, 2006), and the film
actually presents dual Bennetts  the one doing the writing, and the
one doing the living. These two Bennetts are a virtual married couple 
arguing over Ms. Shepherd, and jabbing each other with barbs aimed
directly at known emotional weaknesses. The living Bennett claims to be
so full of British timidity that he couldn't possibly confront the
woman junking up his driveway. The writer Bennett takes the high road
and claims he would rather write spy stories than focus his pen on the
odorous, obnoxious transient living in his front yard. Of course, now
that we have a play and movie, it's difficult to avoid viewing Mr.
Bennett's actions as anything less than inspiration for his writing 
though the extended charitable actions cannot be minimized.With director Hytner and writer Bennett reuniting, it's also
interesting to note that more than a dozen actors from The History Boys
make appearances here. The list includes James Corden, Frances de la
Tour, and Dominic Cooper. Also in supporting roles are Roger Allam and
Deborah Findlay (playing constantly irritated neighbors), Gwen Taylor
as Bennett's dementia-stricken mother, Jim Broadbent as a blackmailing
former cop, and Marion Bailey as a staffer at the abbey.Filmed at the same house where the van was parked for so many years,
the film is a reminder to us to exercise tolerance and charity in
dealing with the poor. Even Bennett's grudgingly-offered assistance is
a step above what would typically be expected. While we could feel a
wide spectrum of emotions for the two main parties here, it's Ms.
Shepherd's character who says ""I didn't choose. I was chosen"". We are
left to interpret her words in a way that is either quite sad or
accepting.The film mostly avoids dime store sentimentality, and that's in large
part due to Maggie Smith's performance. Few are as effective at
frightening young kids or putting the elite in their place. The ending
scene shows the real Alan Bennett cruising into the driveway on his
bicycle just as the blue plaque honoring the lady in the van is
displayed. We can be certain this gesture would not generate a ""thank
you"" from her.",104,2015

extremely realistic. The music throughout the film was actually quite intelligent. It
captured you, and let out emotions as it played during the scenes. I
enjoyed every piece of music that was used in this film, especially
when they're singing in the bars. The chemistry Tom and Rachel had was brilliant. They seemed so
comfortable with each other, and that just lead the film, and it made

with ""Unstoppable"" / ""Nine Lives"", since the martial arts quotient is
very limited. But those who prefer their action films to be driven by
their stories and have a touch of originality in them will probably
like this more. The originality comes mostly in the form of the
hallucinogenic effects of the drug that Snipes gets injected with, and
the ways director David Carson merges illusions with reality. Snipes is
believably haunted by his war memories, just as he is believably
disoriented by the drug; an action star like, say, Steven Seagal, would
hardly be able to handle this role. Playing a police detective who is
also Snipes' girlfriend, Jacqueline Obradors is uncompromisingly tough,
foul-mouthed and occasionally even unpleasant, and she handles it all
with conviction. And Kim Coates always makes a dependable villain. The
film also contains one of the funniest lines I've heard in a long time,
precisely because it's so unexpected: ""Hey, have you seen my pony?""

1439,4.666666666666667,7.6,"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead was one of my favourite films
whilst growing up. The movie follows two irrelevant characters
(irrelevant in that although they served a significant purpose, their
characters were not developed in any depth... Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, as individuals, were relatively unimportant) through one
of the most renowned stories ever told (Hamlet). It is a film about two
characters that are completely unaware of the magnitude of the events
taking place around them. This carries on throughout the entire film,
and is also evidenced in their accidental discoveries of significant
historical scientific findings (such as the steam engine or the concept
of gravity). The characters stumble their way through the film, unaware
of the consequences to their actions or their significance or
importance.The characters spend the entire film coming to terms with their
existence. Shakespeare didn't provide any detailed character
development of either Rosencrantz or Guildenstern, and as such, they
are left confused as to the purpose of their own existence.The film also looks at the concept of a predetermined destiny.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's fate is already determined before the
film begins. And although they play an important role in one of the
greatest stories ever told, they are completely unaware of their
destiny; they are merely victims of circumstance.I should also note that the constant banter between the two characters

1440,12.8,3.4,"Most of the I.M.D.B. reviews of this film appear to be of the 'Mystery
Science Theatre 3000' comedy version, rather than the original. With
all due respect, I fail to see how anyone can objectively comment on a
film when all they have seen is a send-up. It would be like someone
who's never viewed 'The Elephant Man' ( 1980 ) looking at a photograph
of John Hurt as he is in real life and trying to guess what he looks
like as 'John Merrick'!'The Deadly Bees' ( 1967 ) is one of Amicus' lesser offerings. Based on
the novel 'Taste Of Honey' by H.F. Heard ( a title they could not have
used then as Rita Tushingham would have had something to say about it!
), it was written by Robert Bloch ( author of 'Psycho' ) and Anthony
Marriott ( who wrote for 'The Avengers' amongst other things ), and
directed by Freddie Francis. Susanna Leigh is 'Vicki Robbins', a pop
singer who collapses in the midst of a 'Ready Steady Go' type show (
which curiously lacks a live audience ). Suffering from nervous
exhaustion, she is ordered to take time off from her hectic schedule.
She goes to Seagull Island, where it seems only five people live (
including Michael Ripper as a pub landlord ). She moves in with the
Hargroves ( Guy Doleman and Catherine Finn ). Hubby Ralph is a creepy
type who keeps bees, and strangely makes no attempt to have his way
with Vicki. She decides to investigate his furtive behaviour ( such as
using a syringe to extract blood from a horse ), and suspects he may
have perfected a way of controlling swarms of bees so that they can
attack people. Another beekeeper, 'Manfred' ( Frank Finlay ) befriends
her. Several bee attacks take place, and Vicki herself becomes a
victim...Leigh is a lovely lady ( who put me in mind of Wendy Craig ) who
appeared in several '60's films, including Tony Curtis' 'Boeing,
Boeing' and 'Deadlier Than The Male' ( both 1966 ). She's no great
shakes as an actress, and the part does not require her to do more than
clean her teeth and look scared. The then-unknown Elkie Brooks dubbed
her singing voice. Doleman is best remembered as the dour 'Colonel
Ross' from 'The Ipcress File' ( 1965 ) and its sequels, while Finlay
later headlined notorious '70's dramas 'Casanova' and 'Bouquet Of
Barbed Wire'. Tim Barrett appears briefly as a pompous Whitehall
official who has received threats from the mysterious bee master. The mystery at the heart of this story is not terribly difficult to
solve. The island is too under populated for that. The bee attacks -
though crudely done - are nevertheless effective. Had Amicus ever made
a 'Journey To The Unknown'-type anthology series ( as Hammer did ),
this would have been perfect for inclusion.Things To Look Out For - a cameo from chart-topping group 'The Byrds'!Another reviewer said this made 'The Swarm' look good. I disagree.
Nothing in this film compares to the sheer stupidity of Richard
Chamberlain and Jose Ferrer flapping their arms in slow motion as the
bees invade a nuclear power station. And here the bees look real (
though a little over-sized in some shots ) unlike the Styrofoam pellets
thrown at the camera lens in Irwin Allen's notorious 1976 stinker!",84,1966
1441,9.4,6.5,"After what seems like gargantuan efforts to obtain the DVD and the
necessary equipment I have finally managed to see the uncut version of
Joan of Arc.I am thrilled with this new DVD and will add nothing further to the
positive comments that have already been made. However I should like to
pay particular tribute to the wonderful music of Hugo Friedhofer. Of
course, for years I loved his score for 'The best years of your life'
but in terms of writing for an earlier period I never regarded this
composer is quite the same league as, say, William Walton, whose
Shakespeare/ Olivier scores were so memorable. But I have been forced
to revise my opinion.It was Max Reger who commented to the English composer Vaughan
Williams: 'you have a veritable obsession with the flattened seventh'
Well so, it seems does Mr Friedhofer! I suppose one either likes or
loathes pastiche and modal writing. I adore it, and think that in Joan
of Arc we get the best of both worlds. The music has a direct and
powerful emotional appeal. It could scarcely fail to have. Yet given
the fact that Friedhofer uses C20th conventions, harmonies, instruments
and musicians, his 'nods' in the direction of C15th French church music
are tastefully enough done for us to feel that such scenes as the
coronation are, if not exactly in any sense 'authentic' then still
marvellously effective.I should dearly love to know whether anyone has arranged the score into
a suite of pieces and recorded it. That would be a rare treat. Perhaps
some other readers can advise?",145,1948

watch silent movies when they aren't feasting on human flesh.Director Christopher Speeth grew up in the world of theater, and at
college was trained in the tradition of the documentary. He made one
film called ""Sugar"" following two very different diabetics, and then
""Dona Nobis Pacem"", an anti-Vietnam War film featuring footage of
Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. If he had done nothing else,
this footage would have made him immortal, even if not necessarily
famous.By pure coincidence, Speeth met Richard Grosser on an airplane. Grosser
had a strange background, starting out as a violin virtuoso and then
getting mixed up in the development of the ENIAC and UNIVAC computers.
Grosser proposed the idea of a horror film to Speeth, with his thought
on the matter being quite simple: under the current rules, an
investment in a film could be used as a tax shelter. The film was
birthed as a write-off!Playwright Werner Liepolt was hired to construct a script. He started
with legendary cannibal Sawney Bean (also a source for ""Texas Chainsaw
massacre"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"") and then incorporated circus elements.
Allegedly, Speeth's house had a fortune telling machine and
merry-go-round horses converted into chairs, so Liepolt assumed this
was the sort of thing Speeth would like to see on screen. Liepolt was
very conscious of the words he used, with ""carnival"" literally being a
celebration of meat.Much of the film's dreamlike narrative came about during
post-production. The movie was edited again and again, which produced a
non-linear quality to the picture, sometimes intentionally and
sometimes not. If you like cut and dried plots, this might not be for
you.You might wonder, if this is a good film (and it is), why have I not
heard of it? Well, there could be many reasons, but the biggest is
simply that the film was not available. Apparently after a screening or
two, it ended up in Christopher Speeth's attic, collecting dust until
2003. At that point, Windmill Films released it on DVD, but it quickly
went out of print. Don't be ashamed if you never heard of Windmill

1445,10.333333333333334,7.1,"Howard Hawks was once asked about his recipe for making a great film.
His reply: ""Three good scenes, no bad scenes"". I would humbly add two
other rules: A great film is one where no additional scene is needed,
and no existing scene could have been cut. Few competent directors
violate the first rule. The mark of a great director is the ability to
follow the second. Many inferior directors are too shallow or too vain
to understand this - they constantly strive to include superfluous or
redundant scenes - Just To Make Sure You Got The Point - when it is
wiser to let the audience decide what is important. John Ford was the
master at this. Hawks, Wilder, Eastwood, also come to mind. With
Commanche Station, Budd Boetticher showed that he knew how to distill a
great story (with many elements of a Greek tragedy) to its most basic
human elements - Obsession, Greed, Loyalty, Irony, and above all,
Honor.Not only did Boetticher direct a great film, Burt Kennedy (later to
become a fair director himself) constructed a great script. Some good scenes: A conversation between a woman who was taken captive
by Commanches (and held for a time) and the stranger who has just paid
her ransom... Nancy Lowe: If-if you had a woman taken by the Comanche
and-and you got her back... how would you feel knowing? Jefferson Cody:
If I loved her, it wouldn't matter. Nancy Lowe: Wouldn't it? Jefferson
Cody: No ma'am, it wouldn't matter at all.Or two friends, hired guns both, contemplating the need to commit a
horrible crime for money: Frank: You want to go to work, do you? Dobie:
Work? Frank: Making an honest living? Dobie: Oh, no, I don't think I
could do that. I could cowboy some. Frank: Well, what will that get
you? You work yourself to death for somebody and likely they will have
to take up a collection to bury you. Or a conversation between an honorable man and a young man trying to
decide whether he will try to become one: Dobie: A saddle and a shirt,
that's all Frank had. It sure ain't much. Jefferson Cody: Sure ain't.
Dobie: It wasn't his fault, though. Jefferson Cody: No? Dobie: No, he
never knew anything but the wild side. Jefferson Cody: A man can cross
over anytime he has the mind. As for the performances, they are uniformly good. Nancy Gates, Skip
Homier, Richard Rust, and Claude Akins hit the right tone - never going
too far for a laugh or a tear. And Randolph Scott was perfect - A word I do not use lightly. Roger
Ebert once said that Marlon Brando and Paul Newman started out on the
same path: Both came on the scene in the early 1950s, both studied the
Method, both looked good in an undershirt. But Brando went on to see
what else he could throw in to his performances while Newman went on to
see what he could leave out (Newman once said that he was dissatisfied
with many of his early performances because ""you could see the
acting""). In Commanche Station, Randolph Scott provided the inspiration
for such an approach. This is what makes a performance (indeed, a film)
memorable - by distilling your performance to only that which is
necessary, you allow the viewer to remember what is important to them,
not what they are told should be important to them. If I were held to only half a dozen westerns to be labeled as
essential, this would be one of them (The others: My Darling Clementine
(1946), Shane (1953), The Searchers (1956), The Man Who Shot Liberty
Valance (1962) and Unforgiven (1992)).",74,1960
1446,7.25,4.0,"The first movie was not what I call a good movie, but it did have a
certain campiness and fun to it. This sequel however is just a weird
mess in almost every way. The only redeeming qualities were the
beautiful girls and especially Vincent Price's more expanded and
deliciously arch performance. In regard to Price, Dr Gooldfoot and the
Girl Bombs is arguably his worst film(though Green Hell and Story of
Mankind are just as poor as well) but he being Price looks as though he
was at least he was enjoying himself, though I read somewhere that that
wasn't the case. Nothing else however works. The production values look
as though that each one came from different films altogether, and it
looks cheap, further disadvantaged by some very haphazard editing. In
regards to the score, I am going to take a guess and say that the film
at some point was re-scored. If that was the case, it didn't work as
the music doesn't fit the film at all. The script is poor, with the
comedy very ill-judged and everything else has a very overly-corny
tone. The story feels padded, and has nothing surprising or exciting.
Mario Bava's direction indicates that he was completely out of his
depth, because he directs as though he didn't have a clue of what he
was doing. Apart from Price, the acting is terrible. Fabian is really
bland and looks lost, but what truly sinks Dr Goldfoot and the Girl
Bombs is the double act Ciccio and Franco, mugging and grimacing with
no charm, genuine comic timing or grace whatsoever. The pratfalls they
do here are also hopelessly contrived. All in all, a weird and
disappointingly messy film that makes the heavily flawed but somewhat
entertaining first film look like Citizen Kane. 2/10 Bethany Cox",82,1966
1447,4.0,7.1,"Ten stars is too low of a rating! I am a thoroughly invested Peanuts
fan, and have been for as long as I can remember (I'll be 32 this
year). Peanuts is far and away my all time favorite cartoon. I have
always appreciated the blend of childhood innocence with deep theology
and philosophy that is present throughout the 65 years since the world
was introduced to the lovable blockhead Charlie Brown (actually 68
years going back to 'Li'l Folks').This movie continues the blend: both modern and classic animation
styles that I believe set Blue Sky Studios apart from and ahead of both
Pixar and Dreamworks; a classic Vince Guraldi soundtrack with some
tastefully and not overdone modern sound; but best of all nearly all
the classic tropes and references to story lines blended together in a
thoroughly entertaining story that might have come from Schulz himself.Without giving too much away, this movie has everything any and every
super fan of Peanuts could want: kite eating tree; baseball; hockey; an
epic battle with the Red Baron; Lucy's booth; Schroeder's toy piano and
Beethoven; Snoopy sneaking into school; Leo Tolstoy's 'War and Peace';
and Charlie Brown pining away for the little red headed girl.As I said, ten out of ten is too low a rating.",88,2015
1448,12.0,4.6,"At the risk of being considered the Devil's advocate, I must admit to
being puzzled by the extremely negative comments regarding this film
that have preceded mine. First let's grant the obvious: James Mason is
truly awful and his accent is wretched...so bad that at first I thought
he'd been dubbed by another actor. Waldo de los Rios' easy listening
score is bizarre at best, and the Led Zeppelin style song performed by
Jade Warrior during an otherwise atmospheric scene is completely
inappropriate and terrible regardless. However, it must be said that
Bad Man's River is an extremely attractive film, and the widely
available Master Movies DVD is one of the better budget line discs
you'll run across. Cinematographer Alejandro Ulloa clearly spent a lot
of time on his set ups, and some of the footage--especially the
riverboat sequences--are superb. Additionally, the action sequences are
plentiful and quite well lensed. Bad Man's River is certainly a minor
spaghetti, but as long as you can see it in widescreen, you'll be
pleasantly surprised and reasonably entertained.",92,1971

It is I would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times. Matthau

you need to staunch the bleeding. The story is well known and has already
been described in other comments. The two leads give extraordinary
performances, the girls are superb and the situations are side-splittingly

1451,13.6,6.0,"Despite what the trailers will try and tell you, ""Victor Frankenstein""
is in fact a fairly straightforward, character-driven drama about the
relationship between mad scientist Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy)
and his hunchbacked assistant Igor Strausman (Daniel Radcliffe) that
just happens to have a few monsters.Rather than remake the classic story (or should I say monster), ""Victor
Frankenstein"" is a prequel revealing the origins of Dr. Frankenstein's
most famous experiment. Effectively filling the gaps provided by
Shelley's novel, this film provides a ghastly look at his first
hideous, soulless attempts at creating life, which predate the
sympathetic, flat-topped creature as portrayed by Boris Karloff that we
all know and love. That being said, this film owes much more to the
film adaptations of Frankenstein than the book itself. A tip-off is the
prominent inclusion of Igor, an invention not of Shelley's but of
Universal Studios, who cast the incomparable Dwight Frye as Fritz in
James Whale's ""Frankenstein"" (1931), which morphed in Ygor and finally
Igor in subsequent sequels and adaptations. Bearing a somewhat misleading title, the film is really Igor's story.
Working as a nameless freak in a circus due to his physical deformity
(which Radcliffe portrays brilliantly; he could be the next Lon Chaney
Sr.), he is a stranger to kindness until he meets Victor, who
recognizes his brilliant mind and vast medical knowledge. Igor is given
a new appearance, a new name, and a new life by his generous
benefactor, on the condition that he work as Victor's partner and
assistant, bringing his expertise to animating individual body parts
for use in the highly-strung medical student's unholy enterprise.
Victor, in his megalomania, as the ""creator"" of Igor, demands his
complete loyalty, something that is easy for the grateful younger man
to give until he strikes up a romance with Lorelei, the aerialist he
worshiped from afar during his time at the circus. Slowly, he begins to
see beyond his unwavering devotion to the disturbed madness of Victor's
mania for creating life out of death.To add to the conflict, Victor and Igor find themselves being pursued
by the Javert-like Inspector Turpin (Andrew Scott), who, as a man as
consumed by his religion as Victor is by his rejection of it, refuses
to rest until he and his ungodly experiments are brought to an end.
This gives the film a chance to explore the cautionary message present
in Shelley's novel about trying to control to forces of nature in
further depth than simply showing the misbegotten monsters alone.Visually, ""Victor Frankenstein"" is a treat. Turn-of-the-century London
is portrayed in equal parts glittery and grimy, with period-appropriate
costumes and hair adding to the effect. You can't have a ""Frankenstein""
movie without a few dead bodies, and this film is not shy about showing
the various viscera, though it is all for a purpose and is far from
excessive, with much less blood, gore, and grotesqueness than I was
expecting. Much more is implied than actually shown in detail. As
someone who avoids modern horror films for their indulgence, I applaud
the filmmakers' restraint. The action scenes, which number precisely
four and take up less than a quarter of the film's one-hour and
forty-nine minute running time, are brief but intense, though rather
tame when compared with your average action movie. They give Radcliffe
a chance to utilize his gift for physicality, which he plays to the
fullest. Yet for all its trappings as a horror film, the heart of ""Victor
Frankenstein"" is the relationship between Victor and Igor. Both social
misfits, they find themselves appreciated for who they are for the
first time in their lives. It soon becomes very clear that Igor is the
only real friend Victor has in the world, and that the latter, for all
his grandiloquence, needs his lowlier creation more than Igor needs
him. The chemistry between Radcliffe and McAvoy is there and is what
makes the entire film tick. They both give equally strong performances
individually, with McAvoy perfectly capturing the monomaniacal,
socially awkward mad genius, a sharp complement to Radcliffe's soulful,
loyal, levelheaded partner, but together they are a powerhouse,
bringing delightful touches of humor and pathos to an otherwise rather
serious film. More than once I felt myself growing teary-eyed. How many
horror films can do that? As to the many negative reviews, I don't believe the critics and I
watched the same movie. The pacing and focus was tight, the acting
good, the film itself a rather straightforward drama with dashes of
horror and action thrown in rather than a mixed bag, and the various
subplots, rather than distracting from the main plot, came at the
appropriate times, and helped to move it along. The only faults I found
were the slight overuse of slow-motion in the action scenes, the rather
quirky choice of superimposing anatomical drawings over various
characters, and the script's occasionally on-the-nose dialogue (though
Radcliffe and McAvoy's sincere performances made them less noticeable),
but these are small qualms. Overall, there is much more to like than to
dislike.My only explanation for all the hatred is that ""Frankenstein"" is a
revered novel with a strong literary following; critics came in
expecting a remake of the classic monster story, and after they were
disappointed at what they saw as a desecration of Mary Shelley's 1818
novel, they took their vengeance out on this film, which never
pretended to be an adaptation of that story in the first place. It goes
without saying that if you're expecting a faithful facsimile of
Shelley's novel or a 360-degree reinvention, you're in for a
disappointment, because ""Victor Frankenstein"" is neither. But if you
want to experience a well-acted, entertaining prequel to the classic
story, you're in for a real treat.",0,2015

revisionist Western attempting to explode some mythology of the American

long portrayed them to be. The story of ""Doc"" follows the legendary outlaw
Dr. John Henry ""Doc"" Holliday and his lover ""Big Nose Kate"" Elder on their
way to the storied Gunfight at the OK Corral. Doc Holliday is played by
Stacy Keach, as a soft-spoken gent who is deadly with a six-shooter. The
film is gritty and dirty, but the profane dialogue seems like it was added
just because the screenwriter could. My biggest problem is that the scenes
look like they cut away too soon, and should go on at least a few seconds

1454,11.0,6.0,"""Well, well, well. That man knows his guns. So do I.""As I said in my review about the film ""Weaponized"" : ""I have a weak
spot for low-budget, straight to DVD, B-movies"" and occasionally I
discover ""a piddling, unknown and unloved movie, which surpasses some
blockbusters in terms of content and design"". ""Standoff"" is such a
movie. An unpretentious film with a straight forward script. The makers
don't waste too much time and introduce practically immediately a
deadly, accurate assassin (Laurence Fishburne), who turns a modest
funeral into a bloody massacre without batting an eye. His appearance
reminded me a little of ""The Terminator"". But this time with a
jet-black balaclava.The only thing this professional, routinized killer didn't take into
account, is Bird (Ella Ballentine). A skinny, shy girl with a camera
around her neck serving as protection against and a window at the
unjust world, who unwittingly takes a snapshot of the face of the
killer. What follows is a chase because the murderer wants to clean up
this last witness at all cost. An isolated farmhouse owned by Carter
(Thomas Jane), an ex-soldier full of self-pity and remorse trying to
forget his grief using booze, is the endpoint. Remorse because of an
unfortunate accident that happened to his son. As a result his wife
also left him. Bird showing up there might probably be interpreted by
Carter as an opportunity to show a sense of responsibility for once.And before you know it, those two ex-military are in the grip of a
standoff. Sade, the assassin with enough firepower, installs himself on
the ground floor, while Carter and Bird entrench themselves upstairs,
only armed with a ""20-gauge shotgun"" and only one shell. And so the
psychological warfare between the two rivals can start with Bird at
stake. There's no lengthy intro or a detailed explanation. Even the
multiple assassination at the beginning isn't explained or elucidated.
This is in fact of secondary importance. The story develops rapidly at
the beginning. Within 10 minutes you are fully aware what situation
both men are in. There's the possibility that from there on it could
become boring, monotonous and slow. However, the opposite is true.Sade tries in a verbal manner (and also in other ways) to persuade
Carter to turn in Bird, while Carter guards the staircase. The
subsequent dialogs between these two are on the one hand provocative
and offensive. But on the other hand they are also psychologically
thought through. Fishburne is clearly in his element as the
unscrupulous villain. It was a pleasure to see him again in a leading
role (it's at least more impressive than his roles in ""The Signal"" and
""The Colony""). Jane surprised me and this shows that it wasn't his
fault that his acting in ""Vice"" was worthless, but indeed, that film
was quite appalling. Not to say utter crap. Here Jane plays a perfectly
balanced role as a tormented heap of misery, full of despair and
weariness of life, who transforms into a responsible savior. And
finally an honorable mention for Ella Ballentine who did great.Even though this ""home invasion"" film wasn't very original and the
storyline was quite simple, it still managed to captivate me. And even
though the end was kind of predictable, I still wondered how it would
eventually end up anyway. An additional advantage was the short playing
time which in turn led to a proper pace. All in all, a fascinating
film. Yet another proof that films that take place exclusively in one
particular location, can also be entertaining. At least I didn't need
to fight against sleep, as those two guys. More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",80,2016

1458,9.666666666666666,7.1,"MONSTER'S BALL / (2001) **** (out of four)When I finish reading a great book, I don't close it right away. Treasuring
the story's emotional grasp, I just sit there and hold it for a minute,
enthralled, sensing the character's lives are continuing even as I put the
book away. ""Monster's Ball"" is a similar experience. The film contains so much truth,
vigor, and so many harrowing moments, I just stared at the screen through
the ending credits. Even after a second viewing the conviction did not
diminish. It really says something about a movie when you know what happens
and you're equally as mesmerized every time you watch it.Most movies about depravity are really about entertainment, but director
Marc Forster avoids preachy speeches, big sappy moments, and melodramatic
music. Even during the movie's most important scenes, Forster does not
overplay the material. He knows that careful, quiet dialogue, and long,
silent pauses speak louder than lengthy emotional summaries.Consider a scene where a character checks his father into an old folk's
home. It does not feature long good-byes or conclusive hugs. Instead, it
projects unflinching, raw emotion. ""You must love him very much,"" reassures
an attendant to the character who replies, ""No I don't, but he is my
father""The character, Hank, is played by Billy Bob Thornton, who makes his Academy
Award-winning performance in ""Sling Blade"" look like SNL material. Hank,
bitter and racist, lives in a Southern country house with his son, Sonny
(Heath Ledger), and father (Peter Boyle). Hank and Sonny work as prison guards on death row. Sonny desperately wants
out of the family business, especially after an unpleasant emotional
reaction to the latest execution. When Hank explodes at him for his mistake,
Sonny teaches his father a lesson he will never forget. The film eventually becomes a story about the relationship between Hank and
the widow of the man he has just executed. She's played by Halle Barry, who
was paid an extra one-million dollars for doing an extended sex scene
completely nude. This is a gradual, yet sudden relationship that is not
based on physical attraction or love, but emotional need and depravity.Forster makes interesting editing choices. During certain scenes, he cuts
back and forth between separate occurrences while the central action fills
the soundtrack. Especially unique is how he handles a sex scene. While two
characters engage in some of the most graphic stimulated sex of last year,
Forster flashes images of a caged bird before us. A metaphor of shattered
innocence or repressed emotion, perhaps?Actually, Forster fills ""Monster's Ball"" with metaphors, including the title
itself. He even includes a moving soundtrack of timid rhythms and sudden
beats, symbolizing the characters complex states of mind. Forster's
haunting, daring feature reminds us why we all love the movies.",111,2001

1460,4.666666666666667,7.1,"'The Dressmaker' is not the type of film that instantly attracts me to
the cinema. It's the wrong genre, (although this movie is difficult to
place) the wrong story and it creates the wrong type of atmosphere.
Leave this to the women and go and see something a little
more.......you. How wrong I was and how glad I am to have jumped out of
my comfort zone. It was a good excuse to take my good old mum and treat
her to a midday-midweek viewing and some company with her first born or
that is what I told myself when I entered the theatre only to find it
filled with women and retirees excited to be out and about without the
frightening hording masses that congregate on weekends.'The Dressmaker' has been dubbed as the long awaited return of Director
Jocelyn Moorhouse to the chair since 1997 and she has delivered a film
that will be remembered for some outstanding performances from Judy
Davis, Hugo Weaving and Kate Winslet. I agree with the statement that
this film doesn't fit into any particular mold but this peculiar
inconsistency is what keeps the audience fixated on the screen. Just
when you think that the story is heading down a certain path it quickly
turns sideways, takes a detour before arriving at its intended
destination. Some viewers may find this lack of direction annoying and
even film destroying but I think this could be a little over dramatic.'The Dressmaker' holds a certain charm that never leaves it as it sways
back and forth from one type of genre to the next. It can be billed as
a 'black comedy' but it does allow the audience to experience an array
of emotions. At times you will be laughing at the antics on screen and
at other times you will be gripped by the drama unfolding.Based on the novel of the same name by Rosalie Ham, 'The Dressmaker'
centres around Myrtle 'Tilly' Dunnage (Kate Winslet) and her chaotic
return to a small Australian country town in rural Victoria in 1951.
Tilly's tumultuous departure years before were under controversial
circumstances and the small rural community have not forgotten. She is
everything the town isn't - sophisticated, stylish, experienced and
worldly and she has come back for one reason......to reek havoc on
those that callously betrayed her all those years ago.Kate Winslet rarely puts in a bad showing and her turn as Tilly Dunnage
is made even more exceptional with a flawless Australian accent. The
audience will forget that she is English as she seamlessly slides into
the fabric of her surroundings, not once slipping up when delivering
her dialogue. Judy Davis is the star of the show as Tilly's mad mother,
Molly Dunnage. Davis effortlessly steals every scene she is in with
outstanding engagement with a character that is a little bit off
centre. Judy will be recognised for this performance with an AACTA and
it will be thoroughly deserved.Hugo Weaving adds his superb presence as the cross dressing cop,
Sergeant Farrat. His character grows on the audience with eccentric
colourful manner, bringing the best out in Weaving that gives this
wonderful film an extra element of charm. Liam Hemsworth provides the
eye candy for the ladies in a solid role as Teddy McSwiney. Both Davis
and Winslet are caught hot under the collar on numerous occasions. He
is the stereo-typical tall, blue-eyed, rugged country boy who is the
proverbial apple in his mother's eye and does exactly what Moorhouse
hired him to do......stand there and look pretty. Good onya Liam.Joining the familiar talent is a who's who of Australian television
that many international audiences won't recognise but they do give the
film a more authentic Aussie flavour. Could this be the breakout role
for Sarah Snook? Her character Gertrude Pratt is totally transformed by
Tilly Dunnage only to treat the outsider with disdain when 'theories'
are whispered throughout the town.I cannot see any reason why this film won't be enjoyed by the masses.
It is Australian and its dry wit may not appeal to foreign markets
which is a shame. The narrative is all over the place but don't let
this put you off. Dig a little deeper and you will be rewarded with
some brilliant performances.",119,2015

1462,10.833333333333334,8.1,"In fact it's one of Kubrick's most gripping pictures, with a narrative drive
second only to that of ""Dr. Strangelove"" (and it's unquestionably a more
glorious creation than, say, anything he made in the 1950s). English
director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his
own works) says that Kubrick fell into ""the trap of the picturesque"", but
while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd: at the VERY
least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the
screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to
that world. Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they
don't have the effect they do simply because they would make nice
postcards.THIS, I feel sure (without having read Thackeray), is the proper way to
adapt a long story from novel to screen. Each scene is either allowed as
much time as it needs to make its point and its impact, or it's cut
altogether - you won't catch Kubrick skating too quickly over his material
for no better reason than to fit it all in. The third-person narration
(consisting of witty, beautifully crafted sentences - it's about time I did
read Thackeray) almost performs a kind of dance with the images, gliding in
just when we need it, taking a step back when we don't. (So rarely is even
third-person narration used so well.) And as always, Kubrick's musical
sense is unerring. My impression at the time was that I was listening to
mid-eighteenth century music that gave way to pieces from the classical era
as the hero started to move in higher and higher circles. I was more or
less right. But then I noticed Schubert's name in the credits - and I
realised with a start that I'd been listening to, had even started tapping
my feet to, a Schubert piece I was familiar with, without the anachronism
registering.It's a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this. Look at the ones he's
responsible for: ""Spartacus"" (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly,
but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) ""2001"" (the most
magnificent of ALL epics), and ""Barry Lyndon"". The last of the three is by
no means a poor cousin.",184,1975

graphic workout shots,I applaud the maker of this film and just hope more
people get the opportunity to see it.",85,1987
1467,13.0,4.2,"Although I am a horror fan I didn't enjoy the first Children of the
Corn film much, so my view might be a little biased. Although having
said that the movie did have its good points, the children were good
actors/actresses, the violence was realistic and in moments semi
chilling. Unfortunately this sequel shares none of these traits.*spoilers*The first death scene is quite surprising, I mean the guys are killed
by corn, well that is dodgy. In the Stephen King short story the corn
was there to serve as the vector for the children's pagan blood lust.
They were killing to make it grow, though it is fantasy/horror it makes
more sense than killer corn leaves that can smash through glass by
simply being blown in a gust of wind believe me. Not only that but this
scene reminds me so much of The Omen it's unbelievable, and what's with
the Friday the 13th sound effects and Predator visuals? Hell this
monster in the corn even has Return of the Jedi force powers!And what's with the old woman's demise, crushed to death by her own
house? Now that is quite original, and when I was first told of this by
my Cousin I pictured it vividly. Someone slowly being crushed under
their own house, nobody finds the body, nobody even knows she's dead,
until finally the smell of muddy hair, rotted flesh and mushed bones
greet the next visitor on that hot summers morning.Maybe I was putting too much thought into this segment because yet
again this is a scene ruined by cheesy references to other films. The
lady goes under her house after her precious cat. When she is directly
in the centre the children surround it, take the cat out and release
the device raising it from the ground. The house slowly starts to come
down on her and she wiggles backwards trying to escape. The children
just stand there trying to look creepy, she almost gets out, why aren't
they kicking her to force her to crawl back under? In the original at
least the kids were violent; in this they just try to be mysterious.
Well luckily for them she is too old to escape certain death and the
house reaches the ground level crushing her lifeless and leaving her
legs poking out from underneath. But even that isn't enough for the
cheesily poor script writers, who wrote in that her last words should
be ""oh what a world!""? seriously they need to be slapped. All realism
is thrown out the window at this point, that is if you hadn't done so
already what with the Journalist mentioning in a almost tribute manner
""Jones Town"" just to be controversial (or maybe its just that all
American news reporters are inconsiderate slimeballs) and the ""killer
predator in the corn"" bull.And how many times is the word ""corn"" used in this film anyway? Every
time uttered its like a needle being drilled into my brain. Just stop
already we get it.The Dr who was being nice to the children earlier on in the film gets
the worst death ever, and I mean worst, luckily he gets a lolly
straight after. I wish I could tell you more but unfortunately I fell
asleep, well it was 5am so it could have been that, but let's put it
this way I'm an insomniac.This film does have its good scenes, mainly when Danny is arguing with
his dad, the teenage wit and angry demanding parent though
stereotypical is realistic and at least gives the movie some sense of
reality before it generates into the monomania of your average American
teen horrorfest.If you're a fan of the original maybe you should ignore my small
analyses, it's possible you might like this. I mean the Freddy films
became a bit silly, humorous, comic book and people still enjoyed them
(I know I'm one of them) But the fact of the matter is, if your looking
for a serious, creepy, dark horror film then your best bet is to stay
away from this horrid sequel.",92,1992
1468,12.5,4.3,"""The Eves"" is an entertaining modern backwoods/road horror film. It is
a nightmare scenario that is a dark, thrilling journey into cruelty and
psychotica that seems totally Americana. ""The Eves"" is a film I will be
watching again-especially during the Halloween season. There is
something truly terrifying about psychotic young people!The story takes the road horror into grindhouse territory effortlessly.
The innocent trip that turns into a fight for survival against
homicidal madman shows strongly in ""The Eves"". There is a period in the
beginning that gets a bit old with the ""ooh you scared me bit"" which
really set me into the notion that I was not gonna like this flick.
However from the first real scare, that results in the kick-off to the
horror show, the film pulled me in. The blunt cruelty of the
antagonist, against the helpless victims offers a disturbing sense of
realness that hooks you in. I found the cast to be apt in bringing
these characters to life, creating a strong, well executed story. Plus
with the intense, brutality of the last act, ""The Eves"" becomes a
chilling survival nightmare. The special effects, suspenseful build-up, and over all darkness of
'The Eves"" creates a steady, even-paced intensity the feels natural and
""at times"" cringe worthy. The director does a great job working the
cast, and scene direction so that kill scenes look genuine. It is above
low budget quality really. The sound effects, and overall ability of
the film to keep a strong foreboding atmosphere never falls flat. If it
wasn't for the slow, annoying start to the film, with way to many ""fake
scare"" moments, then this film would be flawless. Still the second and
third act make up for that unnecessary exuberance.",85,2012
1469,7.5,2.6,"While many seem to have not liked this movie,for whatever reasons,I
thought it was pretty damn good,for a lower budget film. It has kind of
a modern,yet classic slasher film,feel to it. Don't know how else to
describe it. Good music throughout too,if you like rock. I guess it's
not 'tons of gore&tits in your face' enough for some. The knife kills
were more implied,than seen. I like a little more to knife kill scenes
myself,but still,these were'nt done too badly. Also,it's not too heavy
on the 'sappy bonding moment',thing,that too many movies do with
couples. Good acting,for the most part. Was'nt too fond of 'the sock
part' LOL,but whatever,still a good,low-budget movie,that deserves a
chance,IMHO. A fun movie.",74,2010
1470,5.0,7.0,"My main conclusion after watching The Angel's Share is that I haven't
seen enough Ken Loach films.Obviously I was interested to see The Angel's Share given the Scottish
setting and the little bit of hype that the film has received here
through its appearance at the Cannes Film Festival. I wasn't
disappointed by any aspect of the movie and would recommend it to
anyone.The characters are real and the acting is hard to fault. The film
strikes a great balance between highlighting the mistakes the main
character, Robbie, made in the past and not being overly sympathetic,
and at the same time recognising that he deserves a chance to build a
better future and put it all behind him. The inclusion of the scene
where Robbie is confronted by one of his former victims and the
victim's family was inspired.All of the performances given are believable, but i'd reserve a special
mention for John Henshaw, who plays Harry. There's an almost intangible
sadness to the character where you know he's also trying to make up for
earlier mistakes in his life, although the film never goes into
details. Very understated and poignant in parts.Above all, this is a film with heart and has something for everyone.",101,2012

intrigued all the way through. The acting was actually pretty good.
Except for the guy trying to be Jessie Pinkman the entire movie. Other
than that though it was really good.I did notice they stole the music from Batman Begins several times in
the movie. Not sure that fit very well.The biggest draw back to this move was that they never really explained
what happened at all. I like movies that leave the story up to the
viewer to interpret, but this one didn't give you any where near enough
information to figure out what the heck happened. So, basically, not a bad movie, but very confusing.",0,2008
1472,9.75,6.5,"Ol' Blue Eyes plays a tortured detective burdened with a liberal
conscience, a cheating wife, and a bunch of time-servers and corrupt
fascist bully-boys as colleagues in this interesting and complex
character study. Joe Leland is an anomaly in his precinct - a career
cop from a long line of cops who's read sociology, is tolerant of gays
and minorities and compassionate towards the social detritus of the
permissive society that litters the streets of New York City at the fag
end of the 1960s. Inevitably, he runs up against complacent hierarchies
and corrupt power elites, and along the way makes some deep compromises
that cause him to question his role as a police officer. Sinatra paints
an admirably restrained and nuanced portrait of a man deeply ambivalent
about the kind of authority he represents. The film refuses to offer
any easy answers to the social, sexual and political issues it raises,
and steers well clear of the cartoon heroics of contemporaneous cop
films like Bullit and Coogan's Bluff that also dabbled with the mores
of the swinging 60s. The Detective was marketed as titillating and
sensational 'adult' fare that exploited the recent demise of the
Production Code to offer audiences a new frankness about an America in
the throes of the sexual revolution. But beneath these rather
opportunistic trappings it's a serious-minded exploration of the
meaning of authority and deviance in a post-authoritarian age. While
burdened with some now rather outdated representations of homosexuality
(what plot there is revolves around the homophobic murder of a gay
man), the film's heart is nevertheless in the right place. It's a kind
of liberal precursor to the crypto-fascist and authoritarian Dirty
Harry. That the heroes of both films reach the same final decision, but
for very different reasons, is fascinating, especially given that
Sinatra was himself due to play Harry Callahan in the later movie until
fate - in the form of a broken wrist - intervened. I guess Joe Leland
is Ying to Harry Callahan's Yang. Anyway, The Detective is certainly
worth watching, not least as it represents one of Sinatra's last
meaningful dramatic screen roles.",114,1968
1473,7.5,5.8,"The Dead. Its not the most creative of titles, reading it you pretty
much know it's either going to be a James Joyce adaptation or a film
about zombies. This time it's the latter and the stripped down title
actually works, since this is pretty much a stripped down zombie film.
Moving away from fast zombies, crowd pleasing style and ""fun"" gore
gags, The Dead is bleak, numbing and even repetitive, an approach I
actually enjoyed as it seems to get far closer than many films to the
real horror of such events. It stuns with visuals and draws the heart
with an inspired central heroic partnership, but by and large is many
leagues away from the shallow silliness of all too many popular zombie
films these days. Following at first the journey of Lt. Brian Murphy,
wanting nothing more than to return home from a zombie outbreak
stricken Africa, then Murphy and Sgt. Daniel Dembele, the latter trying
to find his son, this is a quest film as much as horror, the journey as
important as the grue. A first time feature for
writers/directors/brothers Howard and Jonathon Ford (the latter also co
handled cinematography with Jon Ford), The Dead moves at a dignified,
steady paced, sporadically shot through with brief but intense bursts
of tense violence heavy on head shots, laced with a growing respect and
friendship between the two heroes and occasionally touched with
poignancy shining in the gloom of the situation and ardour of the trek.
Its skilfully handled, laconic stuff with a documentarians eye for the
location (I never knew Burkina Faso was such a beautiful place),
characters suitably rounded and likable and a powerful finale, overall
it's a film with a punch. Rob Freeman as Lt Murphy plays things like a
tough guy character actor of yore, impassive and resourceful
determination with a human edge, while Prince David Oseia does equally
well as Sgt. Dembele, carrying himself with authority and intelligence.
As with any such film, the zombies are a major part of the experience,
and The Dead succeeds nicely here. Make up effects are handled by Max
Van De Banks and the zombies are simply portrayed, dead eyed, pallid,
dirty and some bloodied, they move at a refreshing ominous creep as
well, taking after the terrors of Romero pictures rather than any
cheese of recent years. Gore is decent too, a realistic approach is
taken over setting up lots of fun gimmicky kills, the headshots can get
repetitive but there are a few other methods on display, a couple of
which are real grisly crowd pleasers. By and large I had a fine time
with this one and I hardly even expected too, having gone to watch it
on a whim. The film does lag in the middle, stuttering a bit even in
its already measured pacing, but it doesn't take too long to return to
its groove. More irksomely, there are one or two undeveloped scenes
which are too rapidly glossed over, as if time or the budget ran too
short, there are some editing blips as well, though this may well have
been intentional it still comes across a bit of a niggle. Still one of
the best zombie films I've seen in a while though, well recommended.",105,2010
1474,9.666666666666666,7.5,"Brian Friel's ""Philadelphia, Here I Come"" is still the great fictional
work of the last 50 years or so to deal with the Irish Diaspora but
Colm Toibin's ""Brooklyn"" runs it a close second. Sadly, the only film
version of Friel's play was a somewhat dull affair, part of the
American Film Theatre series. It preserved a great play but it wasn't
much of a film, whereas John Crowley's screen version of Toibin's novel
is as close to perfect as we are likely to get. It preserves the feel
of the book, (thanks to a flawless adaptation by Nick Hornby), but this
is also a real film; large, expansive, magical and one of the best
films you are likely to see this year.It's the story of one young girl's awakening, to the world and to
herself. She's Eilis and at the start of the film she is moving from
her home town of Enniscorthy in Ireland's County Wexford to Brooklyn, a
world away on the other side of the Atlantic. She goes at the behest of
her sister, Rose so she might have a life that might otherwise be
denied her back in Ireland. Homesick at first, she finally finds
happiness with a hugely likable and very handsome Italian boy until a
family tragedy forces her to return to Ireland.It's a simple tale, made complex by conflicting emotions and a welter
of detail. It's funny and sad and bursting with life. Brooklyn is a
place of happiness and giving; Enniscorthy a place of sadness and
resentment, though on Eilis' return, a fuller and more confident woman,
it too offers the potential for happiness in the form of a new job and,
more crucially, a new boyfriend. This return also offers a quandary;
should she stay or return to Brooklyn, as well as an ending more tinged
with sadness than might appear on the surface.Nothing about this wonderful film can be faulted, (except perhaps the
appalling trailer that's doing the rounds). The period detail is
superb, beautifully captured in Yves Belanger's gorgeous
cinematography, (the costumes are crucial and they are perfect). Here
is a period piece, (it's set in 1952), that could have been made in the
year in which it's set and the director, John Crowley, imbues it with
great feeling.Best of all, it's superlatively acted down to the smallest part. Roles
that are basically clichés, (the kindly landlady in the US, the parish
priest, the bitchy shopkeeper back in Ireland), are beautifully fleshed
out by Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent and Brid Brennan. Still smaller
parts, (the girls Eilis encounters on her journey, the Italian boy's
family, her mother and sister), are all fully developed by a brilliant
cast but it's the three central performances that are truly great and
award-worthy.As the boys who basically change Eilis' life, in one way or another,
Emory Cohen in America and Domhnall Gleeson in Ireland, are terrific.
Cohen, (a much more handsome, young Rod Steiger), has a real future
ahead of him while Gleeson is fast overtaking his father as Ireland's
finest actor. And then there is Saoirse Ronan as Eilis; the greatness
of her performance lies in as much in what she's not doing or saying as
in what she does. She has one of the most expressive faces in the
movies and it's in the moments of silence that she really comes into
her own and it's one of the great pleasures of recent cinema watching
her character develop. Surely she must be a front-runner at this year's
Oscars. This is a film both for now and for posterity. See it at all
costs.",117,2015
1475,9.666666666666666,7.2,"Others have already mentioned the film's beauty, elegance, attention to
period detail, acting etc. All amazing. As a gay man ""of a certain age""
I felt deep gratitude for the gift given by the artists who created
this film. The direction is so subtle and effective, using the all the
tools of film making to communicate information, meaning, and emotion.Like Brokeback Mountain, this film turns cliché on its head and
transcends the particulars of the protagonists' lives by illuminating
more universal themes. It is a period/genre film that acts to balance
well established tropes of its genre, a powerful corrective to SO MANY
previous films that repeated the same old false, stereotypical, and
often tragic images of gay lives. Beyond merely telling some real
truth, Carol has so much to say about strength, resilience, and the
possibility of finding joy in difficult circumstances. As such, it was
deeply satisfying to this viewer.",118,2015

attention. I think they said it's coming to theaters around April but

1477,12.75,7.2,"Broken Arrow was actually the start of James Stewart's return to the
western genre. His first western was Destry Rides Again in 1939 and he
waited for over 10 years to do another. After that he did them quite
regularly.Broken Arrow was made first, but held up over a year before release so
Winchester 73 was actually Stewart's official return to the west. But
both films had a lasting impact on his career.This is the story of Army Captain Tom Jeffords who with a simple act of
kindness started a peace process with the Apaches led by their
charismatic leader Cochise. Jeffords, a veteran of the Union Army and
the frontier wars is heartily sick of the slaughter he's witnessed and
participated in. He finds an Indian boy who's been wounded by whites
and he tends to them and heals him.One thing leads to another and pretty soon Jeffords finds himself in
the camp of Cochise with whom he strikes up a friendship. He also woos
and wins an Apache maid named Sonseehray. Jeffords and Cochise with
General Oliver O. Howard make a treaty with the Apache, at least most
of them.Broken Arrow did a lot for James Stewart, but even more for Jeff
Chandler who plays Cochise. Cochise was a man in his late 60s when this
was really taking place, but Chandler in his prematurely gray hair,
portrays him well. Chandler got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting
Actor for Cochise. Jeffords and Cochise are men of good will and decency who see an honest
peace as the only answer. Of course both have to contend with people
who won't or can't accept peace with the other race. It's those people
and what they do break the peace that is the rest of Broken Arrow's
story.Delmar Daves is a good director of western films and in fact did
another film about the U.S. government trying to make peace with
another Indian tribe, the Modocs in Oregon, in the film Drumbeat. He
gets good results out of the rest of the cast. Note the performances of
Will Geer as an Indian hating rancher, Debra Paget as Sonseehray, and
Basil Ruysdael as General Howard.The screenplay was done by Albert Maltz of the Hollywood Ten. How
ironic that Maltz was blacklisted after this film. I suppose a film
about peace between the races and good will towards one's fellow men
was highly subversive.Broken Arrow was given much acclaim for being the first film to express
the view that Indians were something more than bloodthirsty savages.
That's not exactly true, other films around that time started saying
the same thing. Nevertheless Broken Arrow's message is an eternal one. Says so in the Scriptures if I'm not mistaken.",93,1950
1478,4.0,5.4,"Most of the negative reviews you see for ""Don Verdean"" are the same as
the negative reviews for ""Gentleman Broncos."" It all boils down to one
basic idea: ""This movie isn't enough like other movies I like.""
Professional reviewers and users alike miss the boat on these movies
because they want them to fit in a neat little package. You'll hear a
lot about how they didn't feel the movie worked as a straight comedy,
or straight drama, or that mixing biblical jokes with more adolescent
jokes doesn't work. They are missing the point. This is not meant to be
a single genre, or even really a mix of genres, instead it is an
examination of characters, ideas, and themes.Unlike many other movies, ""Don Verdean"" (and ""Gentleman Broncos,"" for
that matter) is not looking to work as a whole, indeed these movies
reject the idea of balance and chemistry as proscribed by mainstream
films. Instead, DV is about about the details. Each moment of the movie
has been engineered, largely without a thought for the other moments.
In the Hess world, if something is interesting that's reason enough to
include it, regardless of how it fits together with other pieces.It's not inherently worse than other films (in fact, you'll see
tremendous talent in the film-making, the acting, and the script); it's
just a completely different approach. So see ""Don Verdean,"" not because
it's more of what you already like (and have) but because it isn't.",90,2015
1479,13.0,0.0,"The synopsis for this one sounded fairly interesting and it was on
Netflix Instant, so I checked it out. I've noticed that I typically
enjoy recommendations that are 2-2.5 stars on there because overall, I
quite enjoy bad movies as long as there is something...anything to keep
me entertained.This movie actually starts off fairly good. Then after the
introductions of characters gets over with is when the movie starts to
dive bomb as it's clear the people behind this movie really had no idea
of what KIND of movie they wanted to make. I say this, because early on
it feels like they have a ton of pointless red herrings. For example,
there's a woodsman that you constantly hear off in the distance that
they seem to try and make you think is part of the plot, but he's not.
He's worthless and does not help the movie push forward at all.Another thing that royally annoyed me, is that this is one of those
movies where at ANY POINT each of the cast could have done something to
stop the children who are harassing them throughout the movie (of
course, I say ""children"", but they are most likely 18-20). I mean,
seriously...like 8 people can't take out two little brats, only one of
which was armed at any given point? Come on. And then they actually
capture one of the kids and want to do something about it, but the lead
stops them as if she's not aware they are getting picked off. Oh yeah,
because she's ""just a kid""...riiiiiight.Then the ending....absolutely a cop out. It's like they just didn't
even care to end it. It's not a ""twist"", it's just bad. Do not waste time with this one.",0,2011

1481,11.25,7.8,"Dimitri Tiomkin's thunderous score sets the tone for this rousing story
of cowboy ranchers in nineteenth century Texas headed north, with a
thunderous herd of cattle in tow. It's the archetypal story of the
American West, with its strong, ethical male leader, Thomas Dunson
(John Wayne), and his pursuit of a big dream, set in an era when men
were men, times were tough, hardships were inevitable, guns ruled, and
Native Americans were the bad guys. What a saga ...What makes ""Red River"" such a grand adventure is its high quality. Its
story is simple, direct, exciting, and well told, with complex
characters, interesting and sympathetic because they show weakness as
well as strength. Dunson is a good man, but he's stubborn and
headstrong. His semi-adopted son, Matt (Montgomery Clift), is good with
a gun but a little softhearted. Dunson's chief sidekick is Groot
(Walter Brennan), a cantankerous old buzzard who has problems with his
teeth.It's the relationship between these three men that is the heart and
soul of ""Red River"". Trouble ensues along the way, you can be sure. And
how that trouble unfolds and plays out presents viewers with engaging
human drama, and humor, centered on these three main characters. The
lonesome High Plains, with all its inherent risks, adds grandeur to the
epic story.At strategic points in the film, the page of a book appears on screen
with text that briefly summarizes upcoming events. It's like we, the
viewers, are reading a book about some long ago trailblazers. It's a
technique that could have been intrusive. But here, it is handled with
such finesse that it actually helps the narrative, by functioning as a
transition from one sequence to the next.The acting is fine. John Wayne is more than convincing as Dunson.
Walter Brennan is characteristically funny. And Montgomery Clift is
terrific. Had he maintained his looks, and if real-life circumstances
not intervened, Monty could have been one of the truly top actors
through at least the 50s and 60s.If the film has a weakness, it might be the cinematography. Not often,
but at times, the actors appear to be standing in front of a canvas, an
effect that renders a shallow depth of field. Maybe this was the result
of technical limitations of photography at the time the film was made.There are few film westerns that can compare in quality with ""Red
River"". And I don't know of any other cinematic cattle drives that are
this good. So, the next time you herd your cattle to market, this is
the film to watch. Even if you have no cattle, ""Red River"" is still a
wonderfully entertaining cinematic experience.",133,1948

situations without actually entering the limits of a black comedy.Drugs and ""tripping"" play a major part in the movie. A tone of
supernatural. And of course sex and relationships and friendships, the
""bro"" kind. Yet there are a lot to be desired and a major part of the
film, although uneven, takes the lead and makes lifelong friendship to
seem like it is just an excuse for some crude jokes like blood from a
dripping nose into someone's drink or vomiting into a church during
Xmas mass.Overall: You wont be missing much if you avoid to see this. In the end,
the basic idea of bro-friendship seems like an excuse from some surreal
gags.",101,2015
1483,11.75,5.4,"...And it brings out the worst in people. Take Ted and his dad for
example. John (David Morse) is depressed and bit of a drinker, running
a run down motel in a middle of nowhere, where guests arrive only by
accident. Ted is a cute little blond boy, who caught an acute case of
sociopathy, he's fascinated with death and very weird young man.The running thread in this film is vast, unavoidable loneliness of the
place and characters, not a healthy situation for a kid, who's getting
bored and his anger for being stuck there builds slowly.Creepy kids are often quite annoying, that's just how things are, and
it's kinda hard to actually root for them but there are certain aspects
of his life that can make us feel bad for Ted. At least occasionally,
and for a brief moment. Mom's run away with some random guest, so he's
left with the father, a decent guy but kind of lethargic and a loner
himself. And the dream that he'll one day leave this miserable place
and join his mother.The pace is very slow which of course stresses the atmosphere, the
actual misdeeds that we witness break away from the overall melancholy
and outbursts of anger provide much needed dynamics. There are moments
of tension which get slowly drowned by the tone of the film, building
on leisurely drama rather than lifting the horror elements. But the
finale is certainly fitting, as all we'd seen before it led to the big
resolution. This film is not particularly original, let me mention brilliant The
Good Son, as a reference; but it follows the recent trend in cinema
where slow burn drama dominates even straight genre work, making them
seem more arty and meditative at the expense of action sequences.
Making even US films like this one, seem more...I don't know...European
in tone and style.The film doesn't really dwell on the boy's nature, it doesn't raise
obligatory nature vs nurture question as we are aware this boy's life
is not happy. On the other hand it deals with father - son relationship
a bit, making it very clear mom's absence and isolation has really
affected the kid. But has it really, or did he just want to break away
from boring routine where nothing happens unless you make it so
yourself? ""Oh well. We all do what we can not to think about life"" I
suppose.",105,2015

great (sub-)genre. ""What Have You Done To Solange"" is not only
essential to those who share my enthusiasm for Italian Horror cinema,
however. Be it the convoluted plot, the ingenious camera work, the
brilliant score by Maestro Ennio Morricone or the constant, tantalizing
suspense - there is not a single aspect that is not brilliant about
this stunning film, that I highly recommend to any suspense-lover in
general.Henry Rossini (Fabio Testi), a married Italian teacher at a Catholic
London private school for girls, has an affair with one of his students
(Christina Galbó). When they are having a romantic boat-ride on the
Thames, the girl suddenly yells that she has just seen a knife. Henry
first laughs her claims off as hysteria, until the body of another
girl, also one of his students is found right at the exact same spot
the following day. It is not long until other murders of girls occur,
all carried out in the same, horrid manner...The film is not as gory as many other brilliant Gialli (such as Dario
Argento's films), but the manner in which the murders are carried out
is more than a bit nasty. The film has one of the most compelling plots
ever in Horror cinema, and is stunningly suspenseful from the very
beginning. The eerie atmosphere is even intensified by a brilliant and
mesmerizing score by none other than the great Ennio Morricone. The
brilliant cinematography was done by Joe D'Amato, the infamous 'king of
sleaze' himself who shocked audiences in the 80s when he directed
gruesome productions such as ""Antropophagus"" and ""Buio Omega"". The
performances are also excellent. Fabio Testi, who is famous among fans
of Italian genre-cinema, mainly for starring in crime and police
flicks, stars in his most memorable role here. Karin Baal is excellent
as his German wife, and Joachim Fuchsberger delivers a solid
performance as the investigating police detective. Great performances
also come from the sexy female cast, most memorably from Camille
Keaton, who is best known for the infamous Exploitation shocker ""I Spit
On Your Grave"" of 1978.Like two other excellent Gialli (Argento's ""Bird With The Crystal
Plumage"" and Lenzi's ""Seven Blood-Stained Orchids"") this was heavily
cut and sold as an Edgar Wallace film in Germany. People in German
speaking countries: Avoid the mutilated German version and get uncut
international versions instead. This is brilliant suspense cinema at
its finest and an uncut version is absolutely essential! I could go on
praising this film forever, but instead I will end my review with a
recommendation: Get ""What Have You Done To Solange"" as soon as you
possibly can! It is easily one of the most compelling Gialli ever made
and absolutely essential for every Horror-lover to see! 10/10",0,1972
1485,7.5,3.3,"The quality just plummets further in Ryan Nicholson's new film.The plot is actually a good idea. A guy who drives actors and actresses
to and from their filming locations finally gets to meet his favourite
actress but things soon turn dark when he decides he's going to make
his own movie.The movie kicks off with some ridiculous scene which is neither
explained or has any relevance on the plot other than to put some blood
and guts in there to keep the gore-hounds happy. The film then just
crawls along with terrible dialogue until the next gore scene is just
shoehorned in to stop you from getting bored or falling asleep. The
acting from the start as you'd expect in this grade of movie isn't the
best. The two main leads are acceptable but everyone else is pretty
bad. The film really suffers in its pacing which is further hampered by
lots of static camera shots. Sometimes almost whole scenes filmed from
one angle. Some of the gore effects are also spoilt by some terrible
editing. I don't know if Nicholson is trying to move away from his earlier films
over the top set pieces. But the fact that they're not in here makes
you notice how bad the script is. It neither stays truly gritty or goes
all out over the top. So you're left wondering what the films trying to
do.I remember when I was a kid in a drama lesson at school. The teacher
got us to make up a little play. They only gave us twenty minutes to
come up with something. When the twenty minutes were up we hadn't come
up with an ending. We thought, well we can sort something out while the
other groups are showing there's. Well we were first. So we started and
when we got to the ending we just started making stuff up. It was a
complete mess but we got through it. The reason I'm telling this story
is because the last twenty minutes of this film reminded me of that.
It's a complete mess that just seems made up as it's going along. Just
a real disappointment. I hope if Ryan Nicholson gets to make another
film he spends a little more time actually writing a script rather than
letting his actors improvise the film.",75,2010
1486,8.25,7.1,"The new cinema year has got off to a robust start with the new movie
from Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"", ""Les Misérables""). We have seen many depictions of physical torture on the screen over the
years, from the interminable teen-slasher pics, through 'that chair
scene' in ""Casino Royale"" to the stylized presentations of Quentin
Tarantino and Martin Scorsese in films like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and
""Casino"". ""The Danish Girl"" is also in its way a film about torture,
but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like ""Buried"" or
""Flightpath"". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual
orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body
parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's)
when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.Based on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne (""The Theory of
Everything"") and Alicia Vikander (""Ex Machina"") play a bohemian married
couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying
for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist
with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After
taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are
awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore
the character of his alter-ego ""Lili"" further: a big mistake, as Einar
is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.Eddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave
performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect
and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said
however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili
but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as
Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could
perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect
(particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the
Oscar double. Far more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia
Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the
increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With
Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in
today's cinema. Also turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast
list, is Matthias Schoenaerts (""Far from the Madding Crowd"") as a
Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present
(sorry, that should read ""hard-working"") Ben Whishaw turns up again as
a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch
(most recently seen in series 5 of ""Homeland"") plays Dr Warnekros who
is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment
surgery.Another star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in
vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a
Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously
photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with
mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.Another Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very
fitting score.While the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting,
I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to ""The
King's Speech"". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda
Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in
Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun
intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the
running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an
alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a
good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I
say ""my wife"", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces
and smoking cigars  so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going
on. :-)(For the graphical version of this review, see bob-the-movie-man.com.

unbelievably-acted 'movie' for the rest of my days. I'm just at a loss

heart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if you
don't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or
while) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson)
and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The
beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally
relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep,
deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears;
sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It
made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had
my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was
witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and
one of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read

1488,9.0,6.9,"It's not the best but it most certainly is one of the most entertaining
Bond movies to watch. Because of that reason, ""You Only Live Twice"" is
one of my favorite Bond movies.Basically the movie is just simple silly fun. The story is very simple
and at the same time also totally unbelievable but also because of this
the movie is extremely entertaining to watch. As an action movie this
movie is really great. The movie is truly filled with many spectacular,
if a tad over-the-top action sequences. Most action sequences don't
even make sense that they occur in the movie, once you really start
thinking about it but that is all part of the charm of this
entertaining movie. It's a very imaginative movie that has some
unforgettable sequences in it, that are both thrilling as well as
spectacular.The movie is mostly set in the culturally rich Japan. It works as a
perfect backdrop for the movie and the strange unusual culture helps to
make the movie an imaginative filled one. Also sequences like with
'Little Nellie' and the end fight set in the hollowed-out volcano add
to the adventurous and imaginative feeling of the movie.Ken Adam is also one of the reasons why everything in the movie works
so well. As a production designer he made the right backdrops for the
story and made several elements of the movie work out surprising well,
such as mainly all of the sequences in the hollowed-out volcano.Also the musical score by John Barry and the cinematography by Freddie
Young are worth mentioning.Sean Connery is good and fun as always as James Bond and he still
showed good form in this movie. This time Ernst Stavro Blofeld was
played by legendary actor Donald Pleasence. He takes the movie to an
even higher level. He plays the best Blofeld out of the long series of
Bond movies, along with Telly Savalas who played the villainous
character in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"".This is a fantastic fast paced, action filled movie, that has some
spectacular and unforgettable sequences in it, especially toward the
ending. One of my personal favorite Bond movies, of which I never grow

1489,8.4,4.8,"Truly ridiculous film from one time Full Moon Films Director/Writer
J.F. Lawton who has gone on to write numerous more successful, and
quite similar, films and series for cinema and television. This film is
sometimes credited as launching star Bill Maher to comedy prime time
though as the exploration guide to Dr. Margo Hunt (Shannon Tweed) and
her assistant Bunny (Karen M. Waldron) he rarely shines in this
watchable but mediocre movie. Tweed and co are sent in to the jungle to
look for a scary man-eating tribe and to try and secure the future of
Avocardos for the USA. There are direct parallels here with the current
need for oil and in many ways, because of the current climate, the
movie manages to become clever satire when this was probably never the
intention. Several digs at the then growing women's movement are thrown
in such as Maher's ""She wants to eat me, see for yourself what the
women's movement is all about"" or the suggestion that no Feminist has
advocated Feminism since the 1960s. These jokes aside however - and the
obvious fact that the women are all 'sexy' and scantily clad - it is
the women who are frequently shown to be smart and the men merely void
of intelligence and only useful for the reproductive gene they hold.

wise-cracking with felons and coppers alike, giving a few beatings and
taking a lot himself.
The night scenes are wonderfully shot, with shadow and fog effects being
used perfectly. The main reason to watch this movie, though, are the scenes
between Bogart and Bacall. Their on-screen chemistry (fueled by their
off-screen romance) lends the most weight to the film. My favorite of their
exchanges is when Bogart, tied up yet still smoking, tells Bacall to ""take
this cigarette out of my mouth"". And, of course, they kiss.
A short while later, she helps Bogie take out a hired killer. Bogie remarks
""I didn't think they made them like that anymore.""

1492,14.8,6.2,"Take moments of Blade Runner, the lost themes of Lost in Translation,
and the haunting images of Gattaca and mix them all into a big bowl,
your final product would look something like Code 46. Winterbottom's
vivid imagination and intelligent storytelling is proved once again as
he successfully builds another chapter into sci-fi's growing history.
His ability to take a simple story about a forbidden love and transform
it to a different time and culture was outstanding. His themes of love,
laws, and family are so dominate that he is able to handle them with
the greatest of ease and use them to even paint a bolder picture. Code
46 is an instant Winterbottom classic with the professionally superb
acting by Robbins and Morton, the cinematic eye candy of our future, as
well as a tight script that allows the viewer experience it over and
over with new references every time. Winterbottom proves that no genre
is too small for him to tackle.To begin, look at that chemistry between Robbins and Morton. The sparks
were literally flying out of my television when they were together
on-screen. Their presence together fueled this film to a new level by
creating a truth to their relationship. We were rooting for something
that was illegal in today's society as well as this fictitious
futuristic one. That is a hard concept to grasp for most audiences, but
with Winterbottom behind the camera guiding this masters through the
motions, it came across as nothing more than pure art. Robbins has this
ability to make every character he touches into this humanistic screen
element of yourself. You see yourself in this man as he struggles with
the truths that surround him. He isn't just having an affair, he is in
love with someone that the law will not allow. That would be hard to
pull off for any actor, but Robbins seems to hit his mark with ease.
Morton is no different. She has proved time and time again that she can
handle the intense films, and Code 46 is yet another demonstration. She
handles herself so well, giving us so much from those big eyes that
seem to speak for themselves. We sympathize with her dilemma and want
her to continue so that Robbins and her can meet again and again. She
is a very complex character with more layers that I could count, yet we
see each and every one of them in Morton's role. She holds nothing back
and honestly gives 100% throughout the entire film. That is hard for
any actor to do, but Morton does it with the greatest of ease. It is
obvious that she will continue to be a strong cinematic force in
Hollywood.Second to the phenomenal acting, you have a brilliantly colorful
future. While robots and genetics seem to be the dark horse of this
civilization, it is a guiding light to see love emerge from it all. The
beauty of the city only enhances this sensation even stronger. The
contrast between the city and the desert looming outside shows no
blurred lines. It helps us to see the symbolic references to our
society and the lack of change to this new one. Winterbottom pulls no
punches with his cinematography, taking ideas from Blade Runner and
Gattaca, he thrives on the night and sunlight to show the horror and
beauty of the surroundings. He does not color coat anything with fake
CGI, but instead places you in this very realistic world that could
eerily happen tomorrow (watch the current news and you will see the
reference). Winterbottom does a great job of giving us both dimensions
of this multi-faceted world.Finally, I have to applaud Winterbottom for the script that he chose.
Frank Boyce clearly has done his homework in both the sci-fi genre as
well as the love-interest films. He successfully combines the two into
this brilliant display of both modern and post-modern culture. He
clearly defines the emotion of love through our characters, then throws
a big shock through the system halfway into this epic. What we know, or
thought we knew about his world changes instantly, but in a very calm
and crisp way. He also imaginatively creates this era where languages
do not divide us, but instead is required to know throughout the world.
I thoroughly loved the idea that everyone knows all languages. It broke
the thought that this was going to be an American film. The concept of
the virus was impeccable. While not much is said about this invention,
the consequences that it has on the film continually keep us on our
toes. The mind-shattering voice overs coupled with the actors struggle
only proves that Code 46's entire team was dedicated to the project,
and sometimes that is a rarity in Hollywood.Overall, I thought this was a welcomed change to the recycled love
story syndrome that seems to plague our screens as well as a bold step
in the sci-fi direction. Winterbottom continues to break new boundaries
with his random choices of projects that impresses over and over and
over again. For those of you that did not understand this film, I ask
(wait, request) that you see it again. It cannot be enjoyed with just
one viewing. Code 46 is a multi-view film that opens itself more and
more to you the more often you watch it. This emotional film brought
tears to my wife's eyes. Impressive and challenging! Thanks, Mr.
Winterbottom! Grade: ***** out of *****",93,2003

timeless pantomime technique by carelessly 'updating' each selection
for contemporary audiences with crude step-printing and indiscriminate
music scoring. The tampering severely crippled his comic rhythm, but
with a little mental arithmetic it's still possible to laugh loud and
long. The weakest of the three films is the enormously popular World
War One spoof 'Shoulder Arms', which enlisted the Little Tramp as a
cheerleader for the war effort, but the other two are minor

lines. Since the wife was having a sleep I figured I'd get away with

plays mixed up.It starts as a western and quickly escalates into the absurd. Somehow a

works so he is trapped there. Only one other movie tried this and it is
even worse than this: Oliver Stone's stink bomb U Turn. That film makes
his Natural Born Killers look like Citizen Kane. From the beginning,
with his arrival, his being mistaken by Wayne as Lyle the movie's sense
of reality is painful. If you were hiring a hit-man, would you want a
bit of a physical description of him? Does Cage remotely look like
Lyle? What because they both drive cars with Texas license plates? Are

Bangkok Dangerous he is out of his genre. Do not believe me? Watch

it was released it played at small art theaters for a reason, nobody

movie that shouldn't have played out exactly the way it did.I've heard lots of arguments about how it wasn't quite a drama, but it
wasn't quite a comedy. Its not so hard to imagine that when a movie
tries to play both parts equally, we end up with a watered down version
of each genre. Typically you either have a drama with a few comic
scenes, or a comedy with a few dramatic scenes. This film splits it
right in half, whether it upsets the viewer or not.That said, i think that this was well executed. A buddy movie about two
characters doing what they do best, despite the scorn of family,
associates and management. What is received is an odd couple match up,
with their own problems that make them human, as well as a
understanding of the idea that they have their hearts in similar
places, albeit different circumstances.If you want cream of the crop, find another flick. Otherwise watch this
and enjoy it for whatever it can do. Movies are made for a reason, not
always the one a viewer wants. This movie probably hardly makes my top
500. But watching it from an unbiased viewpoint, i enjoyed it, twice,
for what it was trying to portray.",83,2012
1505,8.0,7.2,"Before anyone starts going off-topic in the comments, yes, I'm a fan. I
also understand the irony of starting with that statement. My point:
this is a review of a cinema experience. An outstanding one. Made more
exciting to me because it happens to be by and about my favourite band.
This is NOT a discussion of the merits of said band's existence.
Although it will strike a mighty blow for Metallica when those
arguments do inevitably come up, hopefully elsewhere. Moving swiftly
along...This is just a truly mind-blowing sensory overload. Never has a band
showcased their live performance with such an ambitious, technical,
multi-sensory project. I wouldn't have even thought it possible. They
don't just use the handy 3D technology to add gimmick to the next in a
long line of live video releases. No. Metallica have pushed the
boundaries of the technology itself, and added dimensions to what we
see as possible within the realm of 3D cinema. I had the privilege of chatting with Lars about this when they played
some shows here in March, and he described it as their ""attempt to
truly showcase what they do and who they are."" Man, does this
emphatically succeed.The stage is a kind of mutant super-setup, comprising video screens,
pyro, tesla coils and the best parts of everything they've ever done in
their live shows. As the audience, you're in/on/under/part-of the
stage, alongside the band, in glorious 3D.And, it's tasteful. In as much as Metallica at their tightest, hardest,
loudest, biggest and fiercest can be ""tasteful."" As for the little story within what is really the best ever technical
and technological presentation of a rock concert, it's a lovely
compliment to the energy of the performance itself. I don't wanna
give-away too much, but as the show begins, a young roadie is sent on
an errand. Things go badly (surreally and beautifully) wrong. It's not
just exhilarating, but wonderfully interwoven with the songs and the
""storylines"" within them. I'm proud to have seen Metallica live seven times. I count this as the
eighth. And it probably ranks fourth amongst those eight live (or, in
this case, damn-near live) experiences. Truly, truly mind-blowing.Metallica have truly - and astonishingly - documented what they do and
why they are the very best there's ever been at doing it. Essential for fans, and absolutely worthwhile for all but the most
hateful of heavy music in general. Bravo.",93,2013

1507,12.5,3.9,"OK, so big spoiler here. Note the disjointed time lines. Note the
different people (at the end) saying the exact same lines other
characters said earlier, creating a repetition of ""get a job"", ""pussy"",
""coward""... etc. Note the ""end"" of the so-called sci-fi plot where Maya
entwines her finger around Cole's ring finger, which jumps directly to
him in a clean hospital bed with Maya entwining her finger around
Cole's ring finger.Does anyone else see that the so-called sci-fi part was actually Cole's
death bed subconscious dreaming a disjointed time line? As in, can you
say it, dream? That Michael did actually shoot Cole (think of this (the
end) as the ""beginning"" of the movie, and the first lines of the movie
were about ""The Light""..as in go to the light? Cole's subconscious
dreams of the aliens are imagined from the Tabloid suggestion of a near
miss comet. There are no aliens, yes he and Maya were together in real
life and his death bed subconscious dreams about the past come in ever
increasing disjointed fashion and ever increasing fantastical
imaginings. Cole's dying. Maya and the baby (and the rest of the world)
are just fine.What this movie is about is a prolonged stream of consciousness (or
unconsciousness) of a dying man who is a guilt ridden loser. The reason
the sci-fi plot is essentially absent is because it is....except in the
dying man's disjointed imagination. Why did I give it such a high mark?
Because it obviously fooled everyone. Note the dream-like sequences,
landscape, surreal scenes and above all that the sci-fi stuff was a
""rip off"" (as one critic noted) of other sci-fi movies. Of course it
was a rip off, it was what was in Cole's head. Cole actually
subconsciously wanted the end of the world, like he wanted the end of
his life, so the suggestion of the Tabloid comet was enough to set off
his ""what if"" scenario. Based on this interpretation, with clues
everywhere, the movie was very good indeed. Watch it with this
interpretation in mind and you'll see it.",89,2014

believe the human code of ethics does not apply to them. Their
reasoning is the end justifies the means. To keep control, dehumanizing
tactics are necessary to control the rank and file. The film plays an
important role in documenting the eyewitness testimony of the many
inhumane abuses that occur in this organization. Cloaked in secrecy and
hidden from the light of scrutiny, the executives of this cult do as
they please. The physical, mental, and emotional abuse is like a POW

unintentionally hilarious, and that's as funny as it gets. This is a
movie that has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Everything about it
is bad. When George Romero made ""Night of the Living Dead"" he did it on
the cheap, but still produced a film that was intense, scary, and had a
point. ""Plan 9"" is nothing but bad, albeit in a wonderful way.As an example of bad production values, there is a scene where a police
car is speeding away from headquarters. As the action begins it is
broad daylight. The next scene is the car racing across the city. Now,
however, it is night! Next is the car arriving at its destination, a
cemetery, and again it is daylight. That is either one huge city, or
somebody on the Plan 9 crew was asleep at the switch.""Plan 9"" is so full of great badness that to detail all the goofs,
flubs, and cheesiness would require remaking the entire movie. The
cemetery is a weed-infested lot; an airline cockpit set is a shower
curtain, some plywood and a couple chairs; a cop scratches his head

has a ladder that goes nowhere; the plan itself, that is, plan number
9, makes no sense at all. And on and on and on...If you love movies, and want to consider yourself conversant in all

1514,10.0,8.0,"If you were to imagine yourself as a newspaper journalist, one of the best
conspiracies you could ever find yourself stumbling upon would undoubtedly
be the infamous Watergate Scandal. And reporters Bob Woodward (Robert
Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) were the two men who found
themselves head-above-water in an elaborate cover-up that went all the way
up the chain of command to the United States President
himself.On June 17th, 1972, Watergate hotel security guard Frank Wills spotted a
possible break-in at the Democratic Party's National Committee. Some
apparent CIA agents were arrested for breaking and entering, and later held
at a trial, where Bob Woodward first found out that they were more than mere
intruders. They worked for the government.After researching into the matter, Woodward soon realized that one of the
intruders had the name of a political figure scrawled in a notebook located
within his shirt pocket. And with the help of Carl Bernstein, a fellow Washington Post reporter (and
a veteran of the field), Woodward followed the slight tracks, and the two
men soon found themselves unearthing a shattering conspiracy that did indeed
lead all the way up to President Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the
United States of America, himself.Based on Woodward and Bernstein's own memoirs, William Goldman's
Oscar-winning script makes for a brilliant subtle mystery; a true-life story
as amazingly honest and forthright as it is entertaining and engaging. It
would always remain the late Alan J. Pakula's greatest film, and its
standing as one of the top films of all time on many various ""great movies
lists"" is certainly merited. It's a shame that both Hoffman and Redford were snubbed by the Academy
Awards for their performances here. As Woodward and Bernstein, the two are
amazingly convincing and bounce dialogue off of each other with striking
clarity and realistic quality. Hoffman, who is top billed, appears in the
film less than Redford, but gives just a performance just as amazing. He
would gain an Oscar twelve years later for his portrayal of Raymond Babbitt
in ""Rain Man,"" his finest performance to date, but his role in ""All the
President's Men"" is of a different caliber. Woodward and Bernstein are two
complete opposites, and at first they rub each other the wrong way --
Bernstein, a veteran reporter, takes one of Woodward's articles and starts
making revisions. ""I don't mind what you did,"" Woodward says, ""I just mind
how you did it."" Even though it's not anything special, this if my favorite
scene in the movie, and perhaps the best example of just how well these two
actors are able to bring their characters to life.The movie is a mystery but not in the traditional sense. Almost all of us
watching the film already know how the story is going to turn out, but the
way it makes its dynamic revelations seem surprising and its story tense and
exciting is one of the greatest examples of compelling filmmaking.For the film's opening sequence, in which Woodward and Bernstein's
condemning news is written on a typewriter, Pakula used sounds of gunshots
to clarify each separate key of the device striking downwards. The 37th
President of the United States of America was sentenced to a sort of death
with the publishing of that article, and the bold gunshots add an extra
depth and meaning to this fact.""All the President's Men"" has no hidden morals, messages, meanings. It's
just a true story about something that happened, brought to life on the big
screen by a great director, an influential screenwriter and two of the best
actors of all time. No, it's not going to have you thinking after it's over,
but if anything, it's the type of movie that will generate a lot of talk
instead. And more often than not, that's a good thing.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer",138,1976
1515,7.25,6.1,"Irwin Fletcher, or better known as 'Fletch' is a Los Angeles
investigative reporter, who quits his job and heads to Belle Isle a
vast 80-arce Louisiana plantation that he has inherited from his late
aunt. But soon after meeting the lovely attorney and spending the night
together, she is mysteriously dead the next morning. This is where the
trouble comes along, with a local lawyer telling him to leave town, and
a stunning real estate agent has come to make Fletch a healthy offer
for his estate. Though Fletch thinks there's something fishy about all
of this and he goes to hilarious lengths to figure the real truth about
why someone wants his land.It never seems to amaze me, about how much I get out of this flick.
Sure, there's nothing truly great about this feature and you can call
it pointless and crude, but I never get tired of the shenanigans and
Chevy's wittiness. You could say it's a guilty pleasure of mine that
will always be a favourite, no matter what anyone else thinks. 'Fletch
Lives' is basically more or less a vehicle for Chevy Chase's dry,
smart-ass humour, and his prominently cunning persona. Really, that's
about it. During this stage he was one of the funniest comedians in his
prime. The others stars who appeared, in the likes of Hal Holbrook, R.
Lee Ermey, Julianne Phillips and Richard Libertini basically play off
Chase's character and fall under the mockery of his heavy-handed
humour. But still, amongst their stupidity are fun performances from
the support roles. The beautiful woman in the film seem to be there
only for showpieces and to always fall under Fletch's charismatic
appeal. Meaning they look nice, but really that's about it.I'll even go to say that this sequel truly outdoes the original. By
containing far more laughs and gags that actually work than that of the
original. I don't mind the original, I like it. If you think this
sequel is going to be just like the 'Fletch', forget it. It's far from
it actually. While the original film was more a mystery story that led
into ingenious gags. The mystery in this one takes a back step, and
that's a BIG one too. The thin story and Chase's narration isn't much
to go by, so most of the elements (or better put, little episodes)
provided in the flick are their to give Chase some ammo to pock fun at,
while dressing up in his offbeat disguises. In doing so, it basically
comes off as parodying that of some movies (look at the title) and the
southern states, especially by ridiculing the KKK and Religious
gatherings. Some of these scenarios are embarrassing and have no
meaning but to pad out the film. But that being said the action and
laughs barely let up, as you just roll on with the sharp humour and
punch lines. Honestly, its inane drivel that's for sure, but everyone
pulls it off well enough. The comical aspect is basically
tongue-in-cheek, with a touch of dry remarks and underlying sexual
perversion. For some it might be offensive and lowbrow, but I couldn't
help myself from raising a smirk from time to time. Chevy Chase's
cool-as-ice performance was great fun, and I just enjoyed his manic
absurdity overall and Cleavon Little was delightful as Calculus Entropy

sentimental favourite of mine, which I always find something joyous

crazy in a fresh and fun sort of way. Once again, a misleading
trailer! Unfortunately the film itself has really none of that offer,
as if Araki, instead of growing up, had been regressing to a film
student again, because, that's what this film feels like: a polished
and yet pointless student film! And believe me, I've seen many of those
in my life! Thomas Dekker is quite likable and he's probably the best
thing in the film and yet he's struggling with a story that has no
beginning and no end (literally no end!) and actually, come to think
of it, no middle either! The film tries to be anarchic, dark, sexy,
funny, rude, aping films like Donnie Darko and even The Rules of
Attraction (which was a pretty faulty film anyway). In the end it is
just too chaotic and definitely too silly to be taken seriously or to
even recommend. There are very few original ideas and the little
excitement in there is only given by the music and the editing, but
certainly not by the story. Even the few good lines of dialogue in the
script remain too isolated and detached be noticed, let alone
remembered and they get lost in the ludicrous plot. What is real? Is
there a conspiracy? Who are those people dressed like animals? Does any
of this really matter? And actually, do we give a toss? In the end it's
very hard to care about who does what and why, so basically you'll just
end up waiting to see who's going to have sex with whom, (basically
everyone seems bed down with just about everyone else in this movie
despite their gender differences) and yet, none of the sex never has
anything to do with the story. It is completely incidental and purely
exploitive. But even if you take it as a sexy film , beyond its average
straight/gay/bi soft-core porn clichés, it is all quite unremarkable
and gets nowhere close to push any boundary and it thinks it does. In
fact it all gets rather repetitive (I lost the count of how many times
some character wakes up all of a sudden from some bad dream). This film
might have been the director's wet dream, but none of that excitement
shows up in the final product. I'll give Araki one last chance then

1521,10.333333333333334,7.6,"Geez, I wanted to like this movie. I love the Rocky saga, and I was
intrigued by the idea of introducing Apollo Creed's son as the new
protagonist. And once the film started getting rave reviews, I got
*really* pumped to see it.Unfortunately, I feel like I saw a different movie from everyone else.
Sure, ""Creed"" has some good acting and a good heart, and it's somewhat
respectful to the Rocky legacy. But, drat it, this film is really just
a lazy remake of the first Rocky film, with Adonis Creed in Rocky's
role and Rocky in Mickey's role. Worse than that - ""Creed"" rips off literally every preceding Rocky
movie. It contains not a single original idea. Indeed, I recognized
every scene - the illness subplot is recycled from ""Rocky II,"" the
boring office job material was previously seen in ""Rocky Balboa,"" the
training montage was in...well, all the old ones...and so on. Just
changing the protagonist isn't enough to make this ancient material
feel fresh.There were some opportunities to explore new directions, but the
filmmakers squandered most of them. For example, the beginning of the
film builds up Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad) as a compelling new
character - but then she gets dropped like a hot potato about 1/4 of
the way through the movie. And Adonis Creed's potentially interesting
romance with Bianca (Tessa Thompson) develops in a very clichéd
fashion; all Creed ever does is lie to Bianca or spoil things for her,
yet somehow she loves him anyway. Why?Even their ""meet cute"" scene didn't work for me. Bianca wakes Creed up
by blasting music in their apartment building at 3:00 AM - which in a
movie is charming behavior, but in real life would be incredibly
annoying. Somehow, Creed is the only person in the building who comes
to complain. Yeah, right.On a more depressing note, I really don't like what the film does to
Rocky's character. If you thought Rocky was a sad old man in ""Rocky
Balboa,"" you ain't seen nothing yet. The Rocky in this movie has given
up on life, and that's not easy to watch. At least in ""Rocky Balboa,""
we got to see Rocky rebuilding his life after losing Adrian, by drawing
closer to his son and developing a friendship with Little Marie. But in
this movie, his son and Little Marie are gone, and Rocky is
just...waiting' on death. Ugh, how bleak. And I guess I'm supposed to
believe that Rocky's forced, chemistry-free friendship with Adonis
Creed gives him a reason to live again. Yikes.I'm not sure why the critics are so into this movie - usually, they
vilify sentimental, lazy remakes like this. I think perhaps they were
really jazzed that Ryan Coogler of ""Fruitvale Station"" fame directed
it. All I can say is, I hope ""Fruitvale Station"" is better than this.
""Creed"" is as unoriginal as a Star Wars movie about blowing up the
Death Star. Worse yet, it reminded me of the inevitable passage of time
in a sort of downer way. Yeah, I think I'll just pretend it doesn't
exist, and toss it in the same bin with other passing-the-torch films

anything about the film), we fall backwards in time and land in the
same place some number of months earlier.""No Way Out"" is a government thriller about an officer wrongly accused
of murder--when the Secretary of State himself is the culprit trying to
avoid a scandal by launching a top-secret cover-up. Costner is the
officer, and Gene Hackman is the Secretary of State. After meeting a
beautiful young woman (Sean Young) at a party, Costner takes her into a
limo and they have a quickie--before they even know each other's names. What's this got to do with anything? Why is my review so choppy and
linear-challenged? We'll get there.The relationship between the two turns into a big romance until Costner
is sent out to sea, where he saves a sailor from falling overboard and
is praised in all the papers--where his girlfriend back home sees his
face and is reminded of him. (Now she's the mistress of Hackman, by the
way--that complicates matters quite a bit.)When he arrives back home, they go on a romantic getaway--but Hackman
finds out and accidentally murders the girl while trying to get her to
tell him the name of her lover. Ready to turn himself in, Hackman is
persuaded by his gay friend to cover everything up and blame someone
else. The gay man even goes and gets rid of the evidence himself--with
pride, I might add. (It's like Mr. Burns and Smithers from ""The
Simpsons""--the latter loves the former, but the former is too powerful
and naive to ever notice.)The clever twist in ""No Way Out"" is that Costner knows Hackman killed
Young, but Hackman doesn't know that he knows that. (Get it?) As he
runs around the Pentagon and other government establishments, the
evidence starts to pile up against him--the negative off the back of a
Polaroid camera, a few eyewitnesses who claim they saw a man outside
Young's apartment the night of her murder, etc.The great thing about ""No Way Out,"" and another factor that separates
it from the rest of its kind, is something that's hard to explain to
someone who hasn't seen the film. Essentially, no one knows who killed
the girl--and Costner isn't placed under arrest straight away because
no one has uncovered any evidence pointing towards him. As the negative
off the back of the Polaroid is scanned through a computer and
painstakingly altered to reveal the man's face on the photo, Costner
runs around trying to eliminate evidence before anyone finds out. The
photo will eventually reveal his own face, yes, but he has a number of
hours until then to find the true evidence that convicts Hackman.This is a smart thriller with a few pleasant twists, particularly the
very end. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's well-acted and
solidly directed by Roger Donaldson, who also made last year's ""The
Recruit"" with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell. The guy obviously likes
government thrillers. This one is a lot more plausible than ""The
Recruit,"" too.4/5 stars.- John Ulmer",0,1987

committing suicide, so it moves to modern times where a Western family
moves in to the home where it happened. Soon they find themselves under
the influence of these spirits. After a beautifully presented opening
consisting of tragedy, this haunted house tale just never gets off the
ground becoming quite uneventful (as it seems to lull about) with its
lightly scripted narrative and randomly silly supernatural
circumstances (rambling crabs?!). Even from what develops, it shows a
real lack of reasoning about certain characters' judgements. Its
frenzied finale is risible, but effectively executed. However at least
it was brave to go out on a powerfully bleak note. Director Kevin
Connor resourcefully sets it up with certain crispness thanks to the
lyrical shape of the camera-work and the pacing is rather restrained
with its slow-burn styling. The exotically picturesque Japanese
backdrop projects another dimension to the fold. But there's no
disguising its formulaic nature and stage-bound set, despite its change
of culture and folklore. Although I did like how the malevolently
restless spirits manifested, waltz, conspire and interacted with the
occupants of the house. Where they went about trying to repeat the
re-enactment of their own harrowing ordeal. How they go about pulling
their stings is toying around with possessions, manifestations and
causing a mess by throwing things about. The cast is dependable, but
sometimes look a bit out of sorts. Susan George remains pleasing, but
Edward Albert and Doug McClure (who had work with director Connor many
times before) are practical with their performances. It should have

For Cryptosurgical Research. The building is inexplicably gigantic. Dr.

Yoshi's swords, the orderly is killed and Yoshi escapes into the go-go

sees a helpless old man being menaced by a gang of 50 year old punks
and, true to his samurai code of honor, decides to intervene. The guns
and knives of the AARP punks can't compete with Yoshi's top quality
samurai swords.Fujioka is excellent as Yoshi. He brings much more class than is needed
to this Charles Band production. He looks at cars, lamps and TVs like
they are new and strange things. He is totally believable doing this. A
movie highlight comes when he sees metal band W.A.S.P on a TV and gets
scared.Two humorous bits are when, firstly, the character of Burger is
introduced. He is a lazy, cigar-chomping slob and provides some mild
chuckles. Secondly, when Yoshi enters a sushi restaurant, a man
exclaims: ""It's Toshiro Mifune!"".The character of Chris narrates the tale. Is it necessary? Only you can
be the judge. One of the more interesting aspects of Ghost Warrior is
how Yoshi's old life parallels his new life. The film cuts back and
forth between the two.According to the back of the VHS box on the Lightning label, Ghost
Warrior is in the ""Time warp tradition of Iceman!"" We would also add
Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time (1991) and Encino Man (1992).The movie is somber and somewhat mediocre. There's not a lot of action
until the end and is worth seeing for the performance of Fujioka and

1529,4.5,5.7,"I really hated ""The Comedy,"" so I'm a little baffled to have rather
liked the director's followup, which is basically more of the same
hilarity-and/or-torture-of-the-brutally-unfunny stuff. But while his
prior film just seemed annoying and smug in its contrariness, this time
it felt like he'd actually located the 9th circle of Hell or something
like. The movie is like an unending nightmare in which you can't escape
the hopelessness, negativity and humiliation of a universe in which you
(or rather the stand-up ""comic"" protagonist here) are on the perpetual
receiving end of a joke you're not even in on. Our ""hero"" is some sort
of victim, yet we can't even feel for him--in fact, we kind of wish
more of his unhappy patrons would throw things or beat him up. It's hard to imagine who to recommend this movie to, but it's sort of
like a Beckett play: Uniquely, repetitiously desolate, with occasional
content that suggests humor, but which perversely and very deliberately
refuses to prompt any actual laughter. It is an expression--or
analysis, or both--of pure self-loathing and existential despair. If
you are in the mood for something grotesque, minimalist and defiantly
unpleasant, ""Entertainment"" will fill that need. If you need a
punchline, you can always dwell on choice of title. I'm not sure where this director can go from here--few movies have so
vividly defined their own dead end in terms of artistic intent and
""message."" I'll almost be disappointed if he picks himself up off the
floor and makes another movie. The next logical step would seem to be
suicide. The bleakest statements by folks such as Lars von Trier or
Gaspar Noe still have more filmic energy than this rather elegantly
crafted movie that dares you not to kick it to see if it's still
breathing. Yet I can't say it was boring--there's something compelling
in its sheer masochism.",103,2015

watching it, it was -- as another reviewer said -- a mix of two
different genres (comedy and horror). However, I'd definitely classify
at more as a comedy. The writing was clever and very funny, especially
when the guys are discussing the plan to survive. If you're looking for
a horror, thriller, slasher-type movie, this isn't for you. If you're
looking for a fun movie with the horror aspect of it in the background,
you might enjoy this. The acting was good, but you can tell from the
cinematography that it was a low-budget indie. I'd advise you to give
it a try. I've seen a lot of indie movies -- too many, really -- and

son is of course the only one who knows what's going on and where CIA

1533,8.75,7.1,"In terms of finding someone to look up to, heroes are scarce in
American cinema. Superheroes, antiheroes, comic book heroes abound, but
an uncompromising, generous-spirited Everyman is notably absent,
despite there being a huge draw for him and a vacuum for good family
entertainment.Enter My All-American, financed primarily by Bud Brigham, (a Texas
oilman and prominent UT Alum) and written/ directed by Angelo Pizzo.
(screenwriter, Rudy and Hoosiers) My All-American is a football story,
and Freddie Steinmark is Everyman. He's a kind, generous, hard-working
fellow who becomes the starting safety for the 1969 National
Championship Football Team, the Texas Longhorns. Writer/director Angelo
Pizzo introduces us to Freddie as a child, with sandlot dreams of
playing football at Notre Dame, but Notre Dame thinks he's too small.
(There are early echoes to Pizzo's prior film Rudy here.) Rather than
force his way onto the Notre Dame Football team (like Pizzo's Rudy
Ruettiger,) Freddie Steinmark finds a home with Darrell Royal, the
iconic head football coach at the University of Texas. Despite his
Steinmark's small stature, Royal recognizes his unflappable persistence
and effervescent personality and offers Steinmark a football
scholarship. What begins as a familiar climb to up the ladder of
college football success changes at midpoint, as Steinmark discovers a
nagging injury that turns out to be much more serious than first
anticipated. Despite some sports personalities deeming the film this
generation's Brian's Song, Pizzo does what he does best. He makes us
feel like we have never seen this story before.Finn Wittrock plays Freddie Steinmark with exacting intelligence. He
makes thoughts visible; he could tell the story without saying a word.
In scene after scene he displays an unswerving loyalty to principle and
a strong grasp on the diploma of manhood. Aaron Eckhart, as Darrell
Royal, has a hard job here. (Royal referred to himself as the Barry
Goldwater of college football). Eckhart's portrayal of Royal is
measured, as he alternates between an extroverted warmness and a
self-controlled, calculating, fear-inducing dominance which helped
Royal lead the Horns to three National Championships. Juston Street,
portrays his own father and UT quarterback James Street with
swashbuckling candor and verve. In terms of supporting roles, he is the
standout here. But Rett Terrell deserves mention, portraying
Steinmark's roommate, Bobby Mitchell, with a steady stoicism and
unexplored depth.My All-American is above all, a relationship movie. For those who seek
love stories, there is a beautiful one here. Freddie Steinmark and
Linda Wheeler are high school sweethearts who go to college together,
and then are asked to endure the strain of facing a serious illness.
Sarah Bolger (as Linda Wheeler) displays her own form of heroism; she
is bright, playful, and child-like, yet stern and has the fortitude to
confront Freddie's illness with an inflexible determinism, resolve and
wisdom beyond her years. And Gloria Steinmark, Freddie's mother, is
adeptly played by Robin Tunney. As the matriarch of the family, Tunney,
presents Gloria with a steely strength and sympathetic tension, as she
is caught between her love for her son and her ambition for him.In addition to an outstanding cast, My All-American's score, by
composer John Paesano, is exquisite. His score highlights the scenes
with just the right mix of melodic emotionality.While we are wholly unprepared for Steimark's untimely prognosis,
Pizzo, leaves us with a form of Steinmark unbent by the weight of his
sorrowful circumstances, and a heart adorned hope and love and
fearlessness. The film infuses a new life and a new courage in the
hearts of every movie goer: May we all face life's obstacles with
Freddie Steinmark's courage and enthusiasm.",118,2015

holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for
humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is
about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the
catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that.
Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face
of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up
things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to
the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they
are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in
the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of
me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was
both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably.
""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you,
it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we
witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it,
that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions
talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the
night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate
the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication

cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!",128,2015
1535,7.5,3.6,"The story is a strong, well written onslaught of witty humor spat out
by comparable indie actors. The characters are, individually, creative
personas that come together in perfect insanity. The cast and director
of ""Hell Fire"" were definitely in sync and really feeling this story
because everything came together to create a wild, entertaining moment
of escapism. Fratto's creativity and ability to tell a story is
stellar, as exciting as John Waters with Trash Cinema, and intense as
Tarantino with his postmodern crime- thrillers. The special effects are pretty tight in ""Hell Fire"" with some very
gritty, realistic horror elements that will please any horror/gore fan.
I was impressed, mostly because it is obvious that this is a low budget
film so I was shocked at the higher quality practical effects used
here. The over all effect of the scenes often felt too real. Kudos.
There are a few moments when CGI is chosen, but never enough to kill
the mood or sap the Hellishly fun energy out of the film. The only suck of ""Hell Fire"" is the very noticeable moments of poor
sound quality during dialog scenes. Not always but it does keep the
film from reaching 100% of its ""awesomeness"" potential. Now the
soundtrack and music were both doing their thing to really create the
right atmosphere Fratto was going for. The music pulled from classic,
b-movie nostalgia and contemporary mood enhancement. Yeah, other than
the wonky sound quality in several of the dialog scenes, things are on
point in ""Hell Fire""  in my opinion. Overall ""Hell Fire"" is a killer action-packed, bloodbath of
supernatural insanity, with an atmosphere of gutter trash avant garde.
I loved this movie and Marc Fratto knows how to tell a great, original
story. The characters are affective and at times likable. Even as bad,
and unsavory as they are portrayed, I couldn't help but connect with
them. These are not people engaging or talking table talk by any means,
this back alley, trashy, real stuff that goes down after dark in red
light districts. Which makes the fact that this is a supernatural
battle between good and evil fought by hookers, pimps, druggies and the
Anti-Christ that much more special. ""Hell Fire"" is definitely worth the

relationships and satirises them almost out of existence. The farcical
""Hotel"" aims to partner 'loner' humans with each other (based on 1
characteristic) in a stress-inducing timeframe of 45 days, often
resulting in deception and the suppression of true feelings in order to
garner a relationship as a means of escape. The other side of the coin
is the outcast tribe living a meagre existence in the woods, where even
flirting is punished with physical mutilation. The cold mechanical
delivery of every single character's lines emphasises the absurdity of
the situation, and bizarrely makes the jokes even funnier. Not since
Richard Ayoade's ""The Double"" has cripplingly awkward humour been so
effective. This film has a lot to say about the fickle nature of
relationships, set against the background of a dystopian society. The
cinematography is as flat as the actors' delivery; this contributes to
the emotionally-stunted, often silent world that the characters
inhabit. The ending is beautifully ambiguous and surprisingly tense for
such an understated scene. A score which fluctuates from terse, rough
string melodies to Italian opera heightens the sense of weird-art-film
which pervades ""The Lobster"": definitely a film which requires full
attention, reflection, and a mind open to arty weirdness, ""The Lobster""

what he would have called a ""status-sphere"" and ordinary sociologists
would have called a subculture. It's about competition within a limited
environment, about acquiring status, about working your way up the
ladder of prestige within a particular specialized structure by means
of courage, skill, and strategy. Only instead of the wild blue yonder,
or landing on the heaving deck of an aircraft carrier, or NASCAR
racing, the thing to be conquered here is Ernest Borgnine, the sadistic
conductor who chuckles as he throws hobos off his train, sometimes to
their deaths, kind of redoing his Fatso Judson number.It's a classical subculture in that it has all the features of a closed
world with its own values. Everyone seems to know everyone else. And,
as in most subcultures, including those that used to be called
""primitive societies,"" the initiate is given a new name. In other
movies exploring such subcultures they may have names like ""Fast Eddy,""
""Minnesota Fats,"" ""Maverick,"" ""Dragstrip,"" ""Charlie the Gent."" Here
they have names like ""A Number 1"" (Lee Marvin), ""Cigaret"" (Keith
Carradine), and ""Shack"" (Borgnine). They even had their own written
language, a set of pictographs scratched into rocks or written in dirt,
conveying messages like, ""This family good for a free meal,"" or , ""Work
for a meal,"" or, ""Stay away. Cops."" There were small communities of
hobos, often carved out of track-side garbage dumps. Interesting cast, by the way, a lot of familiar faces in bit parts --

delousing looks called for. Marvin's face, by the time this was
released, looked just beat-up enough, and from life, not booze. And
check out his decaying lower incisors.The plot has to do with a duel of wits between Marvin, who is
determined to demonstrate his skill at the top of the status ziggurat
by riding Borgnine's train to Porland, OR. Borgnine, much to the
puzzlement of the rest of the train crew, is obsessed with keeping his
freight train clean of hitch-hikers. He's fiendishly clever in smoking
out and hurting riders. Carradine is the kind of youth often called
""callow."" He brags a lot and is brave but, alas, is unable to absorb
the rules of the game because he plays for reasons of self
aggrandizement, not for the team. He winds up in the drink.There's something else about this movie that may keep a viewer
interested. It takes place during the depression. The trains are slow,
fed by coal, and powered by steam. They rock back and forth gently, as
if trying to put a passenger or a stowaway to sleep. And they travel
through a sunny evergreen wilderness in the Northwest. It's the kind of
scenic journey you now have to pay for if you want to make a round trip
to San Juan, CO. What was in the 1930s essential to a certain kind of
existence has now been vulgarized and turned into a tourist's delight.It's a small story about small people. There is nothing epic about it.
The score seems to owe something to Burt Bacharach, who was so
successful a few years earlier with ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid."" And, for my taste, there are one or two too many choker close-ups
filling the screen with monstrous teeth and sweaty flesh. But it's hard

1545,2.0,7.0,"By far one of the Quay Brothers' most haunting works, 'In Absentia'
depicts the suffering of a late nineteenth/early twentieth century
mental asylum patient, Emma Hauck, who would write letters to her
husband by pencil over and over on the same piece of paper, until the
sheet resembled a strangely beautiful abstract calligraphy of psychosis
-- an unintentional work of art. That the letters' sense of hopeless,
desperate scrawling depicts an eternal reaching into the void for her
husband to rescue her from herself -- a relief that could never arrive
-- is chilling.The use of light in the black and white film is exquisite, flashing
like lightning or electrical charges -- as if Hauck's overheating and
tortured brain were illuminating secrets in the darkness that sanity
seeks to hide from us for our own preservation. The repetition of the
breaking pencil represents the 'brokenness' and futility of her own
mind, which is trapped in a hopeless cycle.Karlheinz Stockhausen composed the music for 'In Absentia', creating
the ideal musique concrète score of ambient voices, rupture, madness
and unreality. Stockhausen, who was reduced to tears when viewing the
film, being reminded of his mother who was exterminated by the Nazis,
suggested that, in a role reversal, he had written the images and the
Brothers Quay had created the music.The dress worn by Alice Krige's neurotic headmistress who suffers a

1546,12.0,5.8,"More than any film I can remember in a long time, I have never understood
why this film hasn't gotten higher ratings than it has. The plot, while not
ingenious (and even somewhat predictable) is still exciting and will keep
you engrossed.The film's creators get a lot of points in my book for locale creativity.
Instead of setting the film in some predictable location such as New York,
Los Angeles, Miami or San Francisco they set it in Pittsburgh, PA,
definitely not your ordinary movie location. It's one that adds a wonderful
freshness to the movie however.The location shooting is outstanding. The scenery is different and
excellent, the photography is great, even spectacular in places and the
action is on a par with some of the best action films ever, including
Bullitt. Who would normally think to expect extensive boating and water
action in a state as synonymous with mountains as Pennsylvania is? That
alone is worth taking a look at this movie.I do not usually care much for Bruce Willis. I thought he was very well cast
in this movie however and Sara Jessica Parker added extra special chemistry.
The cast is much better than average overall and includes such outstanding
actors as Andre Braugher, of the outstanding tv series ""Homicide"". I thought
that the casting in general, as well as the photography, location and action
very adequately made up for any possible deficiencies in the plot
itself.I would warn that there is extensive foul language in this film, more than
is necessary even for a film of this genre in my opinion and probably it's
biggest drawback. I would still say that the film is well worth watching
when your in the mood for some escapist fun and action fare. As I said
earlier, I think the film deserves higher ratings than it's gotten so far.

better) and that definitely won't be the last time I watch it.",102,1993
1547,11.5,8.3,"As the second of the three films legendary filmmaker Sergio Leone
collaborated on with Clint Eastwood (not to mention his first with Lee
Van Cleef and his second with 'Fistful' actor Gian Maria Volonte), For
a Few Dollars More gets well earned respect from the fans of the
director and the groundbreaking star. And yet, occasionally there are
those who'll not even know this film from Leone and Clint exists since
it does sometimes get under the shadow of their two most infamous
works, Fistful of Dollars (which for the most part introduced Clint and
Leone to the public's awareness) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
(which solidified Clint as a Western icon and gave Leone a similar
status for film buffs). But taken as a film unto itself, aside from its
place in the trilogy, this is a Western that simply delivers the goods,
and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. The story begins by introducing our two (anti) heroes, bounty hunters
Douglas Mortimer (Cleef), former Colonel, and Monco (Eastwood), a
drifter. They both set their sights on the leader of a gang of bandits
named Indio (Volonte), who is plotting to go after over a million
locked in a bank in El Paso. At first, Monco and Mortimer seem like
their after Indio for the same reason- reward money- though there seems
to be more than each man counted on with him and his gang. From the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood, to the scenes in El
Paso, and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico
desert(s), For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in
his storytelling, as well as in his use of the camera. Using Fistful's
camera-man Massimo Dallamano, Leone does what he does best in his
spaghetti westerns- he creates a perfectly in sync mood with his
characters: each look in a scene, whether it's intense waiting for guns
to be drawn, or just regular conversation, the look of the film draws
the viewer in without over-doing it. Some points are made bold or
repetitious (like Ennio Morricone's score, that keeps its whistling
theme and serene watch theme completely in check), though it's not done
to any degree of annoyance or by accident. In fact, that's what makes his westerns such fun, is that you take them
seriously as films, yet he always reminds you that it's all in the
'movie-world' just by the way Mortimer or Monco strikes up a match. As
for the actors themselves, Eastwood and Cleef are total pros in this
genre, so ever line of dialog comes out naturally, and the supporting
actors (however dubbed over from original Italian) all contribute great
notes as well. At the least, it can appeal to a new generation of kids
looking back to older movies, which may look at this and consider it
more modernly crafted than a John Ford oldie. A+",132,1965

this because I am so annoyed with people's ignorance towards a good
animated movie. I watched 'the good dinosaur' yesterday at the cinema, not knowing what
to expect as I had not looked at any reviews and I had only watched a
30 second trailer...I entered the cinema with my mum and we were the only adults without
children with us! So, before it started I was slightly sceptical,
thinking that it was going to be very kiddish! Then the film started..
through most of the film, my mum and I were in tears! It is the most
heartwarming, emotional, animated film I have watched and it really
touched my heart, some of the scenes in the film were so brilliantly
thought out to show real messages! There was one scene where I was in
floods of tears, the scene dealt with a serious theme, but did it so
brilliantly! (you'll know what I mean if you watch it!) I even came out
of the cinema with my eyes still watering!All I am saying is do not listen to the bad reviews. Most of them will
be expecting something complex but, this film is really not about that!
This film is inspiring! Especially for children! It is a simple film,
but the subtle messages, such as overcoming your fears, the importance
of family, and making your mark were heartwarming, and make you think,
a lot! And for those reviews that said the film scared their child? Well, I
was in a cinema full of children ageing from 2-10, and throughout the
film they were asking questions, laughing, and full of excitement! This
film was very funny, but emotional at the right times, with a great
plot that really makes you think! I loved this film a lot more than
other Pixar films such as wall-E, Up or Toy Story. Yes, I know that
these films have imaginative, classic plots, but this film teaches you
a lot more than they do, and also makes you feel for the characters! So

other hand, Quentin Tarantino (who re-released it in '97 through Rolling

1555,11.0,3.5,"I've seen a lot of weird things on IMDb, but the rating for The Space
Children is as puzzling to me as any I've run across. 2.1?!?! I
couldn't disagree any more. 2.1 is getting close to Manos territory.
The Space Children may not be the best movie I've ever seen, but it
doesn't deserve a 2.1. Why the low rating? I blame MST3K. I enjoy the
show, but as I've argued any number of times, some of the movies that
they lampooned didn't deserve it. Take a look at the reviews on IMDb.
You can split them into two wildly divergent groups  those users who
appear to only know The Space Children because of MST3K and those who
have seen it on its own. The comments from the MST3K crowd always seem
to mention Uncle Fester (Jackie Coogan) in a bathing suit as if it's
one of the most important moments in the film. In contrast, many of the
comments from non-MST3K viewers reminisce about seeing The Space
Children during their childhood. Maybe it's not just an MST3K thing but
an overall generational thing as well. Whatever, I tend to side with
those who enjoy the movie for what it is.And what is it? The Space Children is a nice little cautionary 50s
sci-fi film that speaks to the dangers of nuclear proliferation. Jack
Arnold, one of the best genre directors of the 50s, does his usual
workmanlike job with the movie. It's not flashy, but it certainly looks
good. The Space Children obviously was made on a limited budget. As a
result, the special effects are also limited and Arnold focuses more on
the people. A lot of what happens is implied. But that's not
necessarily a weakness. Too often, low-budget sci-fi films from this
period look ridiculous because of the desire for elaborate special
effects (i.e. monster and aliens) that outstripped the funding it would
require. The acting, while not outstanding, is solid. Even the kids,
who can be annoying at times in this kind of movie, come off looking
pretty good. The cast will be familiar to many who grew up watching
television in the 60s. Overall I've got no big complaints with The
Space Children. Not a bad way to spend just over an hour.",69,1958
1556,6.0,6.6,"he last Christian-themed or faith-based movie I actually enjoyed was
""Fireproof"" and that was more than seven years ago, I was a single man
and that movie even spoke to me, whether or not you're married, whether
or not you're a believer, you can learn a lot from ""Fireproof,"" and I
think that's what makes WHERE HOPE GROWS effective, is that you may be
at the point in your life where you're still looking for what it is
that you'd like to believe in, but you can still get something out of
watching this good-hearted film that changes you for the better.I'm with you there when I say that I don't like movies that are too
preachy or all up in your face, shoving sermons down your throat, which
is why I had avoided pretty much every faith-based movie since
""Fireproof"" because the level of preachiness just went through the
roof, most of them were not even about story and characters anymore. If
I wanted to watch sermons, I'd simply just straight up watch it off
youtube, there's tons of evangelical seminars on the web, but if I come
to watch a film, a film is what I want to end up watching.From writer/director Chris Dowling, WHERE HOPE GROWS, in a nutshell is
about Kristoffer Polaha's character, Calvin Campbell, a former pro
baseball player whose career was cut short due to panic attacks at the
plate. Nowadays, he turns to alcohol for solace and struggles raising
his teen daughter (McKaley Miller). Calvin strikes an unlikely
friendship with a young man with down syndrome, Produce (David
DeSanctis) who works at a local grocery store. This friendship gives
Calvin a new look on life as he finds redemption, but this friendship
will also be put to the test.I think it's wise move on the filmmakers' part that they cast an actual
man with down syndrome to play Produce, instead of having actors like
Cuba Gooding Jr. (""Radio"") or Dustin Hoffman (""Rain Man"") for example.
There is a benefit to actors convincingly pretending to be what they're
not, but there is an even more benefit to just giving the role to
someone who literally knows what it's like to be that person. And David
does a fantastic job of balancing vulnerability, humor, and ingenuity.
You take a few seconds look at David and the way he carries himself,
and it suddenly makes you want to be a better person. I must admit, as
far as filmmaking goes, it's extremely simple, nothing much about it
that would blow your mind, this is a case of working within the budget
that you're given. The plot is also very thin, very generic, this is
the type of road from self pity to redemption that you've seen a
thousand times before, but I still enjoy the themes quite much, and I
think WHERE HOPE GROWS is an important film that young generation today
need to watch so that they can learn to be more sensitive and tolerant
and more accepting of those whose are different from us.Read more at Ramascreen.Com",95,2014

""Conan"" is not for the faint of heart, and not just for gore - there are

John

with the exploits of fighter pilot Chuck Yeager (Sam Shephard) and
concluding with the dramatic flights of the first astronauts.Those astronauts - the Mercury 7 pilots - are a varied group of

tone to this 3-hour film as we witness him breaking several

first astronauts were trained.The only unnecessary and ludicrous parts of this film were the ones on
Lyndon Johnson, where they made him into a total fool. It was as if the
screen writers had a personal vendetta against him, to make him look
almost like a cartoon figure. And the bit with the Australian
Aborigines smacks too much of Hollywood's love affair with tribal
religions. I sincerely doubt some sparks from a fire on earth could be

song was a big hit in the mid 60s and again in the early 70s. But I had
forgotten all about it until it popped up on TCM. I decided to tune in and
loved it!The movie was shot beautifully on location in Kenya (where it took place).
Wide screen viewing is essential for this one. Also, Travers and McKenna
were a real-life couple when they did this film (in fact they remained
married until his death in 1994) and there devotion to each other comes
through loud and clear. Also the lions (male and female) are SO cute when
they're cubs and even beautiful as they get older. Elsa herself was
portrayed by a number of different lionesses but you can't tell the
difference. And Travers and McKenna worked with all the animals for 2 weeks
before filming so they all interact together perfectly. This is perfect
family viewing--adults will adore it as much as the kids.I'm only giving it a 7 for a few reasons--there isn't much of a story and
the film DOES drag a little. Also the cute little shots of the cubs get a
little bit much. Yeah they are adorable, but it got to the point that I
thought the filmmakers were purposely shoving them in our faces to get us to
go ""awwwwwwww""! A little bit too cute for my tastes.Still it's a great film and the music in this one is fantastic (and

1562,13.0,7.4,"It is intriguing how some comments confidently classify ""Shenandoah""
(1965) as an anti-war film and others see it as pro-war propaganda
(insert Vietnam here). The anti-war advocates must be basing their
position on the film's similarity to ""Friendly Persuasion"" while the
propaganda pundits appear to have been influenced by the fact that
screenwriter James Lee Barrett would write the script for ""The Green
Berets"" a couple years later. But given that the screenplay was written
in 1963 and actual production completed by late 1964, it is unlikely
that Vietnam (pro or con) was much of a factor. National consciousness
was a couple years away from regarding that little adventure as
something of real significance. I think the real strength of ""Shenandoah"" is that it maintains the same
kind of uneasy neutrality that the Anderson family holds to throughout
the film. It shows good and bad people on both sides as the family
attempts to just distance themselves as much as possible from the
conflict. That they are not entirely successful in doing so hardly
sends a clear message of either pacifism of patriotism. Director Andrew V. McLaglen's films are some of the least political you
are likely to find, the exception being his frequent focus on strong
women. In ""Shenandoah"", neither Charlie Anderson (James Stewart) nor
his six sons are a match for daughter Jennie (Rosemary Forsyth). The
father-daughter dynamic purposely gets a disproportionate amount of
screen time as Jennie is shown to be the child most like the father and
the only one who routinely stands up to him. This merits the most
attention if one is looking for subtle political messages in the film. Stewart is the only cast member with more screen time than Forsyth. Her
romantic scenes with Doug McClure are also first rate, with a touch of
comic relief as you begin to realize that he has little idea what he is
getting himself into. And their reunion scene at the prisoner of war
train is handled extremely well. Civil war buffs will generally enjoy this film as it presents the war
from the (until then unprecedented) point of view of a southern family
who did not buy into the frenzy for secession in 1861 and remains
resolute even as their property is overrun with union troops. It
wouldn't be until ""Cold Mountain"" that another film would present the
reality of a not so united southern home front. Eastern Tennessee and
western Virginia remained pro-union, and Winston County, Alabama
seceded from the state and attempted to stay in the union. Of course the buffs will find many inaccurate historical details. At
one point the doctor mentions losing a son the year before at
Gettysburg, yet much later Carter notes that the besieged troops at
Vicksburg are eating rats (the Gettysburg battle ended the day before
Vicksburg surrendered). And just after Jennie drives away the federal
procurement agents with a single shot rifle, the family rides off
equipped with the latest lever action models. Like McLaglen's ""The Rare Breed"", ""Shenandoah"" is somewhat of a chick
flick, making it a novelty among historical action adventure films. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",105,1965

to the classic adventure film. Honestly, I think ""Force 10 from Navarone"" was more fast-paced,
action-packed and hilarious as it's predecessor, ""The Guns of

predecessor better. But it seems unfair to compare a sequel to its
predecessor when the film is a sequel in name only. Other than the
opening which re-tracks the memorable final scenes from the original,
FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE mostly flies solo. The cast was excellent. Robert Shaw and Edward Fox are good
replacements to Gregory Peck and David Niven in the roles of Keith
Mallory and Major Miller. Harrison Ford absolutely amazing as Lt. Col.
Barnsby. Carl Weathers is usually out of place, but he's fine enough.
While Barbara Bach and Richard Kiel offer fine performances after their
roles in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"".There will be a few hate remarks from fans of the original, but seeing

1566,15.333333333333334,7.1,"Cyberthrillers may not have started with ""WarGames,"" but it was here the
form achieved an early peak. As more filmmakers follow its example of
portraying a high-tech faceoff between man and machine, ""WarGames"" remains
a
standard to be measured against. While it's not a film classic, it's a
very,
very good popcorn thriller of uncommon craft, charm, and
humanity.Seattle high schooler David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) has only a few
hours to undo what he thought was a sneak preview of an upcoming computer
game but what instead got him tinkering with the U.S. Air Force's WOPR
(War
Operation Planned Response) computer system in such a way as to trigger a
countdown to World War III. The FBI thinks he's a Soviet spy, while
classmate Jennifer Mack (Ally Sheedy) is wondering if this isn't all
really
about a rejiggered biology grade.Broderick is solid, and Sheedy even better, but what really sells this
film
is everything else. Start with the excellent supporting performances. John
Wood as a reclusive professor and Barry Corbin as a tobacco-chewing
general
get much of the kudos, and rightly, but there's a whole deep bench of
quality work beyond that, like Kent Williams as a curt White House
advisor,
William Bogert and Susan Davis as David's out-of-it parents, Alan
Blumenfeld
as the swaggering bully of a biology teacher, and Juanin Clay as a
beautiful
but underappreciated assistant (even by herself as she uses her own mouth
as
an ashcan for her boss's discarded gum.) You know the casting people
behind
this movie were on the ball when the opening sequence features two very
recognizable faces, those of Michael Madsen and John Spencer, in what were
film debuts for both.That sequence with Madsen and Spencer as missile men point up another
quality of ""WarGames,"" the way the movie works in terms of setting up
expectations and developing pace. The harrowing business between the two
of
them is mercilessly presented (""Turn your key, sir!"") and then effectively
abandoned so as to work in the central storyline, the replacement of these
men with computers. We get a macro-view where Dabney Coleman as a
tunnel-visioned warroom executive effectively makes the case for ""taking
the
men out of the loop"" and then zoom back into what seems a totally
unrelated
story, that of slacker teen David Lightman and his high school
travails.The film could have just started with Lightman, and worked its way out to
the business with the WOPR. But the early peek behind the curtain is a
clever way of raising the stakes with the audience before the protagonist
realizes what's up.The set design, cinematography, lighting, and editing all work wonders as
well. The NORAD warroom is really a character onto itself, the ultimate
source of reality in this film (and better for my money than the warroom
in
`Dr. Strangelove,' an obvious inspiration.) The way the cameras dart
around
from terminal to terminal as uniformed USAF technicians follow the
progress
of an apparent Soviet attack, lighting onto one of them just before he or
she relays an important piece of information, is highly addictive and
entertaining.There's some sloppiness in the movie. Madsen and Spencer's talk about this
great pot Spencer's character has scored strains credulity in the
high-security setting they are in, and its blindingly obvious that the two
men we see exiting a helicopter and entering a jeep during the credits are
not the same two men getting out of the jeep moments later. The musical
score is terrible, except for the elegiac tune at the end by which time
it's
too late. And there's no real examination of the morality of Lightman's
serial lawbreaking.But this is a funny, exciting, consciousness-raising movie that is as
entertaining now with the Cold War more than a decade behind us as it was
all those years ago. For all the technical innovation on display, it's
ironically appropriate we remember it for showing us how to butter an ear
of
corn, because it's the human side of the equation `WarGames' keeps in its
sights at all times.[The DVD features a terrific, candid commentary from director John Badham
and writers Lawrence Lasker and Walter Parkes that gives one a real
appreciation for the value of creative license as well as factual
diligence
in making a film of this kind work.]",114,1983
1567,7.5,2.3,"This is my first review (and probably my last on IMDb). I don't
typically take the time to write written reviews because 1. what weight
does my opinion hold and 2. every opinion on anything subjective should
be taken with a grain of salt. However, after watching this movie I
felt compelled to say something. I am a horror fanatic. I love horror
(specifically 80's horror films and B horror films). The cheesier, the
better. That being said, this movie was a travesty in film making. This
is, by far, the worst acted film I've ever seen. The audio was awful,
as if they had only one boom mic for the entire room in every shot so
some of the lines were completely inaudible and others were as if
someone was screaming in your ear. There was absolutely zero plot
development. No character development. One of the worst scripts I've
ever sat through. Nonsensical event/line and another. I just don't know
where it stops. Everything about this film is horrible. It almost seems
as if somebody made a bet with somebody who had no experience in film
saying ""I bet with $20,000 you couldn't write, produce or direct your
own film"". Normally, I'm a very forgiving critic but this is one
special film. Avoid it at all costs. I wish I could get that 60+
minutes back from my life but unfortunately that's impossible. Oh, and
the ending? I won't spoil it but suffice to say it ends mid-shot of the
climax (for whatever reason) as if they ran out of film and said ""Oh
well we've got enough, that's a wrap people"". Rene Perez should be
banned from ever doing anything in show business ever again.",0,2016
1568,11.8,6.5,"This is the second version of 'The Punisher', and while I enjoy the
original that starred Dolph Lungren, I LOVED this one. Thomas Jane was
amazing, he definitely had the essence of the tortured Frank Castle
down perfect. The acting in this movie was extremely well done, a lot
more well done than many people (critics) have given it credit for. I
think that John Travolta even though he can be a bit annoying at times
played a great bad guy, and his character was sinister, and cruel, but
loving at the same time. Will Patton I think almost stole the show with
his portrayal of his character Quentin Glass, because he had a charisma
about him that was equally disturbing. It was a great movie, not just
'great for what it was'. The story was good, the stunts, and the
violence amazing, and I really hope they greenlight for a sequel.",0,2004
1569,10.0,5.3,"I managed to watch the whole movie without too many guffaws. But there
were some. Gotta love the beginning with the Marine Corps ""boot camp""
montage to show the lead character going through his paces so that
later we have the backstory that he's a bonafide jarhead and ready to
lock and load. Upon arrival at ""The Kingdom"" Corporal Jarhead is picked
up at the airport by a soon to be best buddy jarhead. Who just happens
to let his British accent slip out a little too much. After Cpl Jarhead
gets introduced to his company of other jarheads he then gets to meet
Adkins, another Brit passing off as an American jarhead. I knew going
in that if you're gonna see Adkins in a flick, be prepared for a C-list
presentation. Its not that he's a bad actor. Its just that he's not
really a good one. So, more obligatory scenes of Cpl Jarhead trying to
familiarize himself with his duties, a little sexual tension with the
cute little blonde ""secretary"", who we later realize is really a CIA
covert operative, albeit a British one (she's a Brit too and her accent
can be noticed). Then comes Cpl Jarhead's revelation that the embassy
is being cased by an ISIS lunatic but nobody believes him. So you know
what that means right? Yep, 5 minutes later the dude who Cpl Jarhead is
onto leads an all out assault and siege on the embassy. From this point
on its just one long firefight until the end. Bullets flying, RPGs
launching, bodies dropping, snipers sniping, etc. etc. The one major
drawback, and this has been mentioned by other reviews and I'm in total
agreement with them, is that the douchebag Filipino-American really is
horrible. The inclusion of that character almost ruins the film.
Anyhow, it comes down to a last-stand situation with the cavalry trying
to get there to save them. The cavalry arrives but right as Cpl Jarhead
ignites a propane tank to blow to smithereens the head ISIS douchebag.

1570,4.0,6.4,"A Ballerina's Tale focuses on is Misty Copeland, a young woman who
began her career at 13, a late start in the art form, and even in the
modern age, faced great prejudice. Not in a similar fashion to her
predecessors, like the visibly seen Raven Wilkinson, but between being
a Black woman, as well as not fitting into George Balanchine's vision
of the perfect ballerina, a lot of her professional career was an
uphill battle.Of which, largely remains unseen. Which isn't to say Copeland's
struggles aren't documented, but more so title cards provide you
details than imagery of the blood, sweat, and tears which come from
dance practice or her having what could have been a career-ending
surgery. Nonetheless, in this overview of Copeland's career, you learn
about her, her profession, and though she is being touted as the first
Black women in many areas of ballet, the film makes sure to pay homage,
and have predecessors seen, so that anyone watching will see there is a
community, and Copeland isn't just an exception.HighlightsThough I have gone to ballets before, and likely will again in the
future, I am not someone who knows all the technical terms, nor the
history. Within A Ballerina's Tale, however, a basic overview, or
rather foundation, is given so that you are made aware just enough
without being overwhelmed. I liked that while Misty was given the title ""The First Black"" she
made it a point to not make it all about her. She has her title, but
wants to make sure you know who Raven Wilkinson is, wants you to be
familiar with the other people who, even if they don't get the credit,
did pave the way so that Misty didn't have the full-on loneliness which
comes from being the first non-white person in an industry.Within the film it features multiple instances of her performances
caught on film, which I enjoyed since we see her practice so much, even
post-surgery. So to see how much talent, focus, and drive she has
really pushed multiple ideas. The main one being: ballet is no joke.
For whether you are physically seeing, through an X-ray, the damage it
did on Copeland's body, hearing what many would consider horror
stories, and Copeland pushing the idea her pain tolerance is almost
superhuman, to not leave the film respecting the madness and love these
performers have, I think would be impossible.Lastly, I have to say I loved the film directly addressing race, and
showing Black women having comradery. For among the representation
Copeland brings to ballet, I also believe that the film brings the idea
that just as she shouldn't be alone on stage, no Black person, or
person of color in general, should feel they will be alone in the
audience. For while, as one of her supporters note, there perhaps
aren't a lot of men interested in the art form, that is changing. Low PointsBeing that we are told Copeland is one of 6, I did find it odd that we
don't see any member of her family throughout the movie. For while I do
feel we get a strong introduction to her professional life, her
personal life is almost completely absent. Which I'm sure may be
welcomed by those who may care only about her career, but it leaves the
film fractured. To put it another way, it has a Beyoncé documentary
style. Something in which everything is tightly controlled and
manufactured for consumption, to the point nothing seems real or raw.
You see what you are meant to see and hear what you are meant to hear,
and nothing which doesn't imply perfection, and the most marketable
person around will get to you without someone breaking Copeland's
trust.On The FenceWith the large amount of people introduced, I did wish that the name
cards would have appeared more than once. For while I latched onto who
her manager was, there were other names in there which I thought would
have just had one segment and never be seen again, and when they popped
up later in the film I struggled to remember who they were.Overall: Worth SeeingLet me start off by admitting that this isn't like the majority of the
films placed within the ""Worth Seeing"" label. For one, this isn't
something I think is of universal interest, nor is it on the level for
a non-ballet fan to suddenly take an interest. For while Copeland is
charismatic, and surely this documentary will make for a good
foundation in case her life is even dramatized, there remains this
feeling that it belongs in a niche. Likely because, between the topic
of ballet, as well as Black women in the medium, it seems finely
focused. To the point, the film acts as more of a presentation on
representation than us truly getting to know Copeland, those who came
before her, or even those who supported her. For, as stated, with the
absence of her family, and more so people speaking about her than with
her throughout the movie, there is a bit of disconnect when it comes to
this being about Copeland. Though, I would argue, while this film
disappoints in truly getting to know Copeland past her smiling façade,
at the very least if you know a young Black child, or a young girl of
color, who is interested in the art form, at the very least the film
lets her know she isn't alone, and the possibilities are endless.",85,2015

the time and newsreels of Congress hearings. How did they do it? This
shows the how and when, the risks. Of course, Trumbo captures the full
story of the persecution. Stay to the very end of the film, stay for the credits as some of the
clips they show are so meaningful. I don't know if Trumbo was the person shown in the film, but if he was,
he was an American hero. I think films like this represent the spirit,
the best or worst of the spirit of what happened.Trumbo wasn't just a hero from the look of it, he was also a survivor

1574,6.5,7.2,"Spoilers Ahead:First, as your movie reviewer, if you are looking for a history of
Apple or even Jobs himself, this movie will disappoint you. The movie
is an existential dissection of a genius coupled with Danny Boyle's
deep ambivalence about the computer. The first scene is the essence of
the movie, my friends. We see Arthur C. Clarke, a votary of technology,
telling the reporter (a stand in for Boyle) how the computer will be in
everyone's house by 2001. In the middle of his worship, the reporter
points out how empty and antisocial a life it will be. Clarke takes
mild umbrage and tells him how it will liberate everyone
geographically. Now, you will understand why we labor upon Job's
divorced wife and denied daughter. This is the paradox of Boyle's Jobs:
he invents a machine that connects the world but he is so interiorized,
like all geniuses, that he cannot relate to other human beings. Notice
how he reverses himself with child support for Lisa when she uses his
'child', the Mac, to draw with MacPaint. Jobs then tells the mother he
will write a blank check. This is the key to the movie, the Mac is
Steve Job's existential offspring as much as Beethoven's symphonies
were his jealously guarded progeny. When Jobs speaks of the Mac you
will always hear paternal argot more appropriate for a father speaking
of his child.The other key scene is where we learn about his orphan past where he
says,""I never understand people who surrender control, I never would.""
This deep rejection is the engine that drives him relentlessly
forwards; it explains the bizarre anomalies: special tools, two ports,
the cube slightly off, no acknowledgment for the Apple 2 and his hatred
/ contempt for the consumers who are buying his child. My favorite
scene in the movie is where Lisa senses the deep anguish driving this
man forward, she wordlessly runs across the room and hugs him.
Fassbender does so well here, notice how all the rage and fury
evaporate from his face for just an instant. We see the only scene of
him at peace in the whole movie. This is what he seeks, the rejected
orphan pushing himself forward. Listen to his language,""I feel like
Julius Caesar surrounded by enemies."" The iconic tearful decent in the
elevator, after the Apple board votes him out, also is Boyle's image of
Steve Job's personality. Yes, detractors, I have heard awful things
about the man's factories in Asia, how wretched the working conditions
were. I am just reviewing the movie, I defer to others who have better
knowledge of the actual Steve Job's life. What is the point? The point is Boyle shares many of our ambivalencies
about the computer being either 'social' or 'entirely a positive.' When
you walk into a room and everyone is glued to their devices you may see
what Boyle is driving at here. The man who connected the world runs
after a grown Lisa who just called his iMac a 'suzy bake oven,' and
stormed off. He clings to this one connection to humanity. This is the
motif, the rejected genius driven relentlessly forward, so interiorized
that people don't really exist for him. He only forms the bond with
Lisa when she uses his 'child' for drawing. I recommend the movie to
you as a look inside the mind of a genius. He is not idealized, his
cruelty and ruthlessness are on full display. Especially to Daniels, he
is as cold as ice. This is why my favorite scene works so well, when he
gets the love he was denied, we see the driven fury dissipate from his
angry face. The movie not only conveys the mind of a genius but also
Boyle's deep ambivalence about the computer that you saw in the opening
scene. This was the deep pathos of Boyle's Jobs, he connects the world
but he lives deep within his mind obsessed with his existential
offspring: The Mac. Like Beethoven, he treats everyone around him
simply ghastly. His ontological interiority is almost impenetrable,
only Lisa seems to break through his deep reveries. The movie, despite its flaws, is an excellent look into the ontology of
a genius: their psychological isolation from the rest of the human
race. I am typing this on an iMac, my voice heard by people around the
world thanks to Steve Jobs. Those of you who believe in an afterlife,
like me, can but hope that the man finally received the peace he never
found in this life. Fassbender gives the best performance of his I have
ever seen; I was also impressed with Winslet who has come a long way
from Titanic. A Good Movie. Q.E.D. Deus Vobiscum Steve. ""There Is No Genius Without A Touch Of Madness."" Seneca",122,2015
1575,6.5,5.5,"Not a terrible film by all means, kind of an entertaining if middling
one. The first film Arthur and the Invisibles wasn't that great(to me
that is, you'll think differently), rather average with some
good-animation, music and most acting and voices- and bad things like
the story, pacing and some scripting, but it's still the best of the
three. Revenge of Maltazard was rather messy, not really coming to life
with poor humour and an ending that felt unfinished. This third and
final film Arthur and the War of Two Worlds is an improvement on the
second, but for this viewer was still left wanting. The animation is
very good though, colourful and well-rendered, in fact the whole film
does look lovely. Sure, Maltazard's appearance is rather scary for
youngsters but it was one of the film's cleverest touches. The music is
rousing and beautiful, with bouncy rhythms and melodies that stick in
your head. Most of the acting and voice acting is fine as well. Freddie
Highmore is still a very likable hero, while Mia Farrow is a
compassionate grandmother figure and Selena Gomez is very charming as
well as natural(Madonna in the first film to me was odd casting, and
sounded too much like trying to sound young) and interacts very well
with Highmore. Lou Reed is so much better and more involved than in
Revenge of Maltazard, there he sounded bored, here he sounded creepy if
just lacking the suavity that David Bowie brought to the character in
the first film. It actually helps that Maltazard is better-utilised
here. The grandfather is also funny and endearing, and the duel on the
toy train is exciting, that, the exhilarating final half-hour and
Maltazard undergoing plastic surgery are the highlights of the film.
Jimmy Fallon is a little better, less irritating than before, but he's
still not very funny. Neither is the slapstick, which is more juvenile
and dumbed-down above anything else. The dialogue does feel bland and
underwritten, and while the story has its moments and has its heart in
the right place it does lack urgency and sometimes logic. The pacing
comes alive in the final half-hour but mostly it's rather staid. The
world of the minimoys is an attractive one, but not one that entirely
draws you in, while the live-action sequences are still not as
impressively written or staged. All in all, far from terrible and has
some good things about it but not a sequel or final film of a trilogy
that goes out on a bang, though not quite bad enough to be a whimper,
more semi-whimper. 5/10 Bethany Cox",101,2010

by Cliff Robertson is indeed very good, and I think the movie raises
some interesting points in its portrayal of the James/Younger gang as a
metaphor for the final death rattle of the old south against the
modernizing north. However, this movie can't seem to decide between a
comedic tone or an ironic and cynical one. I would say it succeeds in
its more serious moments, but the comedic sections are very contrived.I went to college in Northfield, and I was glad to see my alma mater
represented in the film (before its name was changed to Carleton). I
became pretty familiar with this raid after attending Northfield's
annual ""Defeat of Jesse James Days"" festivities four times.
Surprisingly, the actual raid itself is portrayed fairly accurately,
with the proper body count and roughly similar series of events,

1579,11.2,8.0,"There are many bad ""issues"" movies out there, but this is not one of them.
In a bad movie, all of the racist characters would be one dimensional and
one hundred percent evil; here, Steiger is allowed to play a prejudiced man
who is actually sympathetic and capable of growth (hence the Oscar). In a
great twist, Virgil Tibbs himself is shown to be capable of prejudice, as he
pursues Endicott without sufficient evidence. It's refreshing to see a
movie that portrays the entire spectrum of racism, from the crazy extremists
(and there are plenty of those on hand here) to the more subtly prejudiced. ""Mississippi Burning,"" a weaker effort, is not only more tediously didactic,
but also less progressive; that film doesn't feature a protagonist like
Virgil Tibbs, and instead focuses on the actions of two white federal
agents. In this case, the old movie really is the better movie; produced at
the height of the civil rights struggle, ""In the Heat of the Night"" feels
more immediate and passionate than preachy films on the subject that were
made years later, after the tension had died down. Some reviewers complain that the mystery segments of the film are confusing,
but I follow them without much trouble. Tibbs does a great Sherlock Holmes
routine throughout, as he pieces together the solution based on clues that
are also available to viewers. Sure, the ending is surprising, but it
doesn't come entirely out of left field; I actually admire the subtle ways
that clues are sewn throughout the film. If you're not used to mysteries,
the barrage of red herrings and dead-end clues might surprise you, but it's
pretty standard stuff for the genre.I knew about the classic line ""They call me Mr. Tibbs!"" long before I
actually saw this movie. I used to wonder why the line was so famous; it
doesn't sound that exciting, does it? But when I finally heard Poitier say
it in context, I asked my brother to pause the tape so I could cheer without
missing any of the subsequent dialog. That's how excited I get during this
movie. The performances are so naturalistic, and the racial conflict so
vividly drawn, that I get pulled into the action completely. Though 1967
was a strong year for films, I still think that the right one got Best
Picture, and not just because it was topical; ""In the Heat of the Night"" is
a well-directed, superb character study, populated by some of the most vivid
characters I've ever encountered in a movie. ",109,1967

this an open ending. The boy is still not back, his (grand)parents are

around has not been solved in any way and even in the end I had no clue

to obtain information, as he lands one, an off screen voice says
'that's a ringer.'The British prisoners, mostly from Dunkirk, who because of capture sat
out the war have a ringer among them in The Captive Heart. It's Michael

players. Try not to miss it if it is broadcast.",104,1946
1583,11.2,6.4,"If someone checks out the trailer, one might think, ""Another MTV-produced
teen flick. I think I'll pass on that."" Well, I went into the theater not
thinking it was going to be bad, but I expected more of an amusing film that
isn't really high on ingenuity. True, ""Varsity Blues"" has those standard
teen elements like wild drinking parties, the school slut, etc. But it
never overuses those elements. It's more of a compelling comedy-drama about
football that delivers a fine message about sportsmanship. You have a
pretty good idea how it's going to end up, but it's the way it's executed
that makes it special. Jon Voight is absolutely terrific as the no-nonsense
coach. He's the kind of character you want to stab in the chest every
minute he's on screen, and Voight was a perfect choice. The film dabbles
with elements of the sport that probably hit home to some high school
football players. Voight's character has only one goal: winning. And he
doesn't care how he gets to that goal. If he has to shoot drugs into every
one of his players, he's going to arrive at that goal. And I'm sure there
are coaches out there who have that selfish goal. Then James Van Der Beek
comes along, and his character is not really concerned with winning or
playing football in the first place. But he likes football, has fun with it
and simply wants to play a good, honest game. If the team wins, good. If
it doesn't, so what. He has a good locker room speech at the end of the
movie. ""Varsity Blues"" is funny, moving and wonderfully acted. It might appeal
more to teens and young adults, more than the older ones, but I still
suggest everyone check it out.",106,1999

and over the top title, but to be honest I wish the movie had been
given a more generic name. This is the fourth film I've seen by the
talentless Andy Milligan, and it's the third completely awful one. It
would seem the director has an obsession with rich families and
inheritance, as this is yet another film with a similar theme to Blood
Rites and its crappy remake Legacy of Blood. This time, there's a
family curse involving werewolves thrown in, but this doesn't make
things any more interesting as the terrible acting and production
values are still there, and this really is an awfully boring film. The
plot pacing is trite throughout, and the film was giving me an itchy
fast-forward finger before the final credits finally rolled. The
special effects are tacky and ineffective, and there's not a single
decent gore scene in the entire movie. Add extremely poor sound into
the mix, and you have a film that isn't only boring and similar to
other crappy Andy Milligan films, but one that you can't even
understand! Overall, I wouldn't be callous enough to recommend this
dross to even my worst enemy and you should take that as a reason not
to bother seeing it.",91,1972

1588,4.5,6.4,"""Fatherland"" or ""Vaterland"" is a West German movie from 1986, so this
one had its 30th anniversary last year. The director is Ken Loach and
he recently made the headlines with his new work on Daniel Blake
(including several BAFTA nominations). This is also I guess why this
one we have here went up a bit on the IMDb star-meter. Anyway, it runs
for 100 minutes roughly in the version I saw and here we have the only
acting performance from musician Gerulf Pannach's career. It is a lead
performance and he seemed like a good choice because his character here
has some possibilities to his own life and career. Just like Wolf
Biermann for example, Pannach was critical with the SED regime in the
GDR and the fact that he starred in films like this one on the other
side of the Wall certainly did not help things at all. There are even
some people who think the SED regime may have used radioactivity on
Pannach that could have resulted in his untimely death to cancer. We'll
never know. The script here is by Trevor Griffiths, an Oscar nominee
for Warren Beatty's ""Reds"", so the background has some parallels.Now about the action: We have an East German musician who commits a
crime (according to the regime) and is told that he has to choose
between leaving the country or going to jail. He does the former, but
has to leave behind a whole lot that he loves, not just his family, but
also the people who admire him and love him for who he is in terms of
the approach to music and politics. The East German regime of course
treats him as a traitor afterward who apparently did not care about his
fans or the GDR. Plus there is also a background story about the
protagonist's father who was in a similar situation decades earlier
during another crucial time in German history and the parallel between
father and son. I personally thought the first 40 minutes or so were
really interesting, when it is all about re-integration and I liked how
the film depicts that the left as well as the right side of the Berlin
Wall are both scum basically and that Pannach's character is nothing
but a tool that they both (want to) use for their own despicable
purpose in order to show their people that their ideology is the only
right one.It is interesting how the film basically always relies on Pannach's
character's interaction with one female. Be it the woman he loves, an
agent who welcomes him in West Germany or a French journalist with whom
he is supposed to have a special connection. I write ""supposed"" because
I was not feeling this connection at all. To me, Pannach and Babe had
almost no chemistry at all and this was a negative deal-breaker here. I
never had the impression during their pretty long screen presence
together that I was watching authentic characters and dialogue. Such a
pity. Everything until then was pretty good, but then it was really
going south. It becomes an entirely dialogue-driven film the longer it
goes and with the dialogues not working as meaningfully at all as they
were supposed to work I must say I am pretty disappointed. There was
certainly potential for more with a better final story arc. I don't
even think it was the problem of the actors. This decline in quality is
also why I give this movie a thumbs-down eventually and don't recommend
checking it out. ""I, Daniel Blake"" is still my favorite 2016 film from
what I have seen so far and easily will stay in the Top5 or Top3, but
with the three-decade-old ""Fatherland"" Loach is nowhere near the level
of his most recent projects.",111,1986

Will Farrell, Gary Beach, Roger Bart Dir. Susan StromanI don't think the critics know what they are talking about. This movie
rocked! It took me back to the old days of movie musicals. You know,
the Bugsby Berkley years, big and flashy with hum able songs. Based on
the 1968 film starring Zero Maestel and Gene Wilder, and the smash hit
on Broadway, the story of a failing Producer named Max Bialystock who
has just had the worst show in town close called Funny Boy, a musical
version of Hamlet. Distraught he runs into accountant Leo Bloom who
comes up with the notion that you can make more money with a flop than
with a hit. Max overjoyed to hear such wonderful news lays it all out.
Step 1. They find the worst play ever written, the ""mother lode"" as Max
calls it when he comes across Springtime for Hitler, written by
neo-nazi Franz Liebkind. Step 2. Hire the worst director, a prime and
proper gay man named Roger Debris who wants to keep everything gay!
Step 3. Raise 2 million dollars from Max's backers: harmless little old
ladies looking for a last roll in the hay. Step 4 Open on Broadway and
before you can say step 5 they close and run off to Rio. All goes well
until Springtime for Hitler becomes a success leaving Leo and Max in
the dust.People have been comparing it to the original, which sure it has some
of the same lines, and the story is the same, but both shows have
something different to offer. You get songs in this version that you
don't get in the original. Nathan Lane tears up the screen and will
have you in stitches as Max; his show stopping number ""Betrayed"" will
have you applauding. Matthew Broderick is also very good as Leo who
can't grab life by the balls and go. He sings ""I Wanna Be A Producer""
with such gusto and dances with Ms. Uma Thurman, who is amazing as
Ulla, and their dance number has sheds of the old Astaire and Rogers's
musicals of the 30s.Also excellent, are Will Farrell as the Nazi who speaks to his birds
and Gary Beach and Roger Bart as Roger De Bris and Carmen Ghia they gay
""couple"" who want to put Springtime for Hitler on the stage, both stand
out in the cast, and both played the roles on Broadway. Other familiar
faces you will see are Jon Lovitz as Leo's accounting firms boss,
Michael McKean as one of the prisoners and Richard Kind as the Jury
Foreman who took over in the Nathan Lane role on the stage.Susan Stroman doesn't make the camera cuts flashy, they are simple,
which makes it more enjoyable to watch the dance numbers, from the
opening number to the hilarious ""Along Came Bialy"" when the old ladies
do a dance break with walkers, to ""Keep it Gay"" to the uproarious
Springtime for Hitler number. The best-staged number was probably ""I
Wanna Be A Producer"" as it has shades from the 30s mixed with modern
day. It was wonderful! If you listen to some critics who choose to say
""this film show inexperience"" or ""not as good as the original"" you are
missing a terrific movie musical that is just as good as Chicago! Plus
Mel Brooks was also standing there at the helm with Ms. Stroman. Be
advised to stay until the very end of the credits to view something
special! Bravo!",134,2005
1590,8.0,8.7,"OK, where do I start? PT (as fans around the world call the band)
shaped a new path of musical awareness for me. Their albums
transcending from one album to another, conquering everything in their
way and never compromising with their sound and quality of music. I've
been a huge fan of the band ever since I heard Lightbulb Sun and
afterward digging deeper into everything they've done. For a start,
their ""Arriving Somewhere"" DVD released in 2006 left me in awe. From
the camera work to the lighting to their brilliant performance. The
band delivered with help from John Wesley who plays guitar and sings
backing vocals for the band during live sessions. From what I've seen
from their previous performances (Rockpalast, Nearfest, MHz, and some
bootleg videos uploaded by fans around the world in you-tube), PT
promises everything a music fanatic could ask for. Myself being an avid metal fan all my life, live performances matter a
lot. And Porcupine Tree, not being a metal band (although having a lot
of metal elements in their music post-In Absentia), became my favorite
band (or should Isay ""The Greatest Band In The Planet"") due to their
amazing liveperformances, their passion and sincerity for the music
they play. The vocal arrangements done by Steven Wilson is beyond
belief (Ethereal), followed by the catchy and technical drumming by
Gavin Harrison, the haunting atmospherics produced by Richard Barbierri
and the on-the-dot precise bass-lines by Colin Edwin. Come 2010. PT now released Anesthetize. With a fan following much
larger than before, one can witness the crowd gathered there to witness
the Greatest Band In The Planet doing what they do best. Starting out
with Fear Of A Blank Planet from the album with the same name and
playing the whole album live on stage, I was stunned at the precision
of the band, not that it was something new, but that they were simply
amazing. What also caught my attention was the awesome and sometimes
psychedelic lighting and the background videos which would leave you
feeling like never before. This DVD/Bluray is unlike Arriving Somewhere
in almost every aspect, although I love their previous DVD with all my
heart equally as I love this one. From the formal performance shown in
Arriving Somewhere, comes a heavier live offering, belting out songs
from Fear Of A Blank Planet, Nil Recurring, Signify, In Absentia and
Deadwing. I envy the people who have seen the band in person, because I
for one would give anything to see them before my time is up. My only
complaint is they should have played some tracks from their Lightbulb
Sun and Stupid Dream albums. None the less, one of the greatest
concerts you will ever witness on DVD, the other contender being their
previous DVD. This DVD left me feeling more grateful to be alive and
proves that great musicians still walk the Earth. Thank you Porcupine
Tree. Thank you Steven Wilson. Highlights: My Ashes, Halo, Anesthetize, Sentimental, Normal,

1592,9.75,0.0,"""Deadly Hero"" (1975) is a 70s-style neo-noir. It's quite good, but
beware that it seems to start off a bit slowly with some scenes that
run too long, like a dancing/music scene. Once it settles down and
focuses itself, it becomes more edgy. Don Murray is great as a violent
cop who is first recognized as heroic but then is accused of murder. I
felt that the movie did not generate much if any sympathy for him and
his plight. After all, early in the story he guns down kidnapper James
Earl Jones for no good reason at all when he has already surrendered.
There is some allusion in the movie to Murray's character being an
outlier among all police. We are shown many sides of his character,
such that we can to some extent understand him. Being a street cop for
18 years has hardened him and being tough has got him commendations.
He's imbibed a philosophy of being society's instrument against crime
when the justice system fails. Regardless, his behavior can be seen as
a prototype for today's far more extensive and unnecessary police
brutality.The film is very 70s, which is not a criticism. It's blunt, energetic,
colorful and has a realistic street-wise edge. Being fully a New York
City movie brings in an array of loud and boisterous New York
characters.Diahn Williams, who reminds me of Mary Tyler Moore, is perfect in the
part of a 45-year old cellist who is kidnapped by Jones and becomes a
key witness in the events leading to his death. The story develops into
a thriller, but the heart of the movie has to be the tragedy of it that
culminates from the basic conflict between Murray's behavior and the
conscience of Diahn Williams.",0,1975

Fonda is amazing in the role of an ordinary man, who accepts passively
the situations, believing on God and praying for strength and justice.
Vera Miles is fantastic in the role of a wife who believe she has part

Alfred Hitchcock. Maybe due to the theme be so serious, Hitchcock

most successful music businesses in history  until it wasn't. We get
the usual endless interviews with employees, plus a few now-doddering
celebrities babbling on about the wonderful times they all had. The
employees from management on down were apparently loaded on booze and
who knows what else day in and day out. What a party they all had!
(Somehow, this doesn't jibe with my own recollections of Tower, where
sullen clerks with nails pounded into their faces couldn't find their
own behinds with both hands, but maybe that's just grumpy old me.)
Anyway, the fascinating (not) interviews about the glory days take up
most of this pseudo-documentary. Then comes the big reveal. What killed
Tower's business was  wait for it  digitized music and its subsequent
piracy. Gosh, I never would have guessed. And when you stop to think
about it for a minute, there's a big lie at the heart of this
revelation. What killed Tower Records and the CD business in general
was their own greed. To get the one decent song you wanted, you had to
shell out 20 smackers for a CD filled with more bloat tracks than
Samsung packs crappy apps into their phones. It was a colossal rip-off.
So when Steve Jobs came along with iTunes and let you go back to the
grand old days of the 45 rpm single, and you could buy the one track
you wanted for 99¢, it was time for all the record store pirates to say
goodnight. In any case, I fell asleep four times trying to watch this

Campbell. It stars Fred MacMurray, Jeffrey Hunter, Janice Rule, Chill
Wills, Dean Stockwell and Josephine Hutchinson. Out of Universal
International Pictures, film is a CinemaScope production in Eastman
Color, with photography by George Robinson and music by Joseph
Gershenson.Three brothers must contend with big personal differences whilst also
trying to see off a band of cattle rustlers who are pillaging from
their herd.But you don't cover me with your shadow.So many good things involved with this production it feels unfair to
label it as dull, but dull is ultimately how it ends up being after
film has run its course. The cast assembled is a strong one, the
dialogue is sharp and well written, and the location photography out of
Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park is most pleasing. Prolific Western
scorer Gershenson also produces a highly effective score, very
reflective of the characters' stuttering emotions. But with a running
time of almost 90 minutes the makers have over stretched the family
feud premise by having too many periods of story inactivity. Biggest
problem of all is that the coward of the title, Bless' (Hunter) back
story is never fully formed, adding little snippets here and there
doesn't do it justice. For instance: it's only late in the day that we
find his reputation is tarnished outside of his family, the whole damn
town are down on him. A better director than jobber for hire Biberman
would surely have got more from this tortured character axis.Stockwell and Hunter are not the best of actors all told, but they fit
right into the roles of two brothers made of different stuff. Stockwell
does a good turn as the young and fearless one, and Hunter as the
middle brother of the three effectively conveys the psychological pangs
that sting him during the plot. The elder brother is played by
MacMurray, who offers up a weary surrogate father performance for this
fatherless family. It's the death of the father that is the catalyst
for Hunter's problems. While Hutchinson adds a bit of class as the
fretful mother and Wills is always good value for money. Rule gets the
short straw from the screenplay, in what is a critical (two fold) role,
she isn't asked to do anything other than look pretty and say soothing
words to tortured Bless. The action is competently constructed, though
the art of throwing a convincing punch is sadly missing here. And the
ending, whilst being predictable (no shades of the far superior Saddle
the Wind here), has enough warmth about it for those not in need of
blackness in their Western viewings.By definition it is very much a B movie in the truest sense of the
term, but there is good in the production, even if it is undone by
slackness elsewhere. 5.5/10",88,1957

reveals that Donald is in fact the Antichrist destined to take over the

Donald's boss also says that a baby will be born who will have the

turned in a worse film than the original. I saw 666: The Child a couple
of days ago so basically I have seen both in the space of a weekend &
quite frankly I almost lost the will to live they are that bad. At
least 666: The Child had a plot which you could follow, sure it didn't
make much sense & it was pretty poor but there were at least signs of a
story there while in the case of 666: The Beast you will struggle to
find anything approaching a coherent story. 666: The Beast was a
straight The Omen rip-off with a creepy demonic kid this time around
Donald is grown up & the first hour or so is nothing more than him
getting a promotion & then being told his true destiny which he takes
surprisingly well. Who was his boss anyway? How did he know who Donald
was? Why was he Donald's boss? Wouldn't it have more sense if Donald
was the company president? I doubt Donald will be able to mastermind
the destruction of the entire world as a junior vice president! There's
precious little incident, there's no horror, there's no gore, the story
is awful, the supernatural elements are absolute rubbish & what
happened to the sexy secretary Sydonai? It moves along at a snail's
pace & is really boring, hardly anything happens & the whole thing is
just a mess.Director Everhart has the shaky camera syndrome, it's not as bad as The
Blair Witch Project (1999) but the camera sways gently from side to
side on most shots. Basically it looks awful as well as being horrible
to watch. There are a couple of scenes set in a church which are quite
moody since they are lit by huge shafts of sunlight coming in through
the window & they are at odds with how bland the rest of 666: The Beast
looks to the extent they almost feel like they belong in a different
film. The gore is none existent, all the murders from the first film
666: The Child are replayed in flashbacks but as far as original gore
goes there are a few off screen stabbings & a bit of fake blood
otherwise absolutely nothing. There's certainly nothing in 666: The
Beast I would describe as a special effect.With a supposed budget of about $500,000 the makers didn't have a lot
of money to play with but that's really no excuse for turning in such
an awful film, there are plenty of low budget horror films out there
which are much, much better than this. The acting sucks as well.666: The Beast is a terrible film, it's one of those films which make
you want to reach for the 'stop' button on your remote control & how I
managed to prevent myself from pressing it I will never know. 666: The

1599,10.0,7.1,"French horror has been pushing the boundaries for some time now. First
there was Haute Tension, then A l'Intérieur and newest in line is
Martyrs, hyped up to take it all a little further. And it did, it
definitely did. It's just that it doesn't belong in the same list as
the films mentioned before. Martyrs goes way beyond.Those expecting another fun, bloody, gory, insane horror flick can just
up and leave, because Martyrs isn't like that. While it borrows the
horror from films like A l'Intérieur and Haute Tension, the tone and
effect of the film is much closer to Irréversible or better yet,
Grandrieux's La Vie Nouvelle.All these films belong to the French Extreme wave, a rather broad line
of films of different backgrounds and themes, but all bearing an
unrelentless level of extremity. And Martyrs stands proudly at the top
of that list, even though Laugier himself seems a little hesitant to
claim all credits for his film.Martyrs starts off like you'd expect a bleak, raw and pitch black
horror flick to start off. Only minutes into the film, bodies start
flying and guts is spilled royally. Strangely though, there's no joy,
limbs are flying enjoyment to be found. The presentation is cold, the
characters are emotionally wrangled, the tension is harsh. Lucie, the
main characters and victim of a year long torture plan, evokes the
sympathy of the viewer and plays it out incredibly well.The first half of the film keeps balancing on borderline horror,
keeping its crude and dark exterior, but never crossing any boundaries.
A Grudge-like ghost in added to the film, but Laugier stays close to
the drama and never allows the film to become a mere horror flick.
Things take a turn for the worse around halfway through, where the
torture theme of the film is given even more power as Anna, Lucie's
guardian, discovers the truth about the torture/kidnap story of the
past.From that moment on, the film becomes really uncomfortable to watch and
crosses over to the realm of Noé and Grandrieux. We are witness of cold
and painful torture scenes, driven to very unpleasant extremes nearing
the end. The film follows the methods of the people who torture, which
are based on repetition and endurance, making it all the harder to sit
through.In a rather surprising move, this film was released in theaters in
Belgium by one of the most prestigious labels here, the reason for that
is laid bare in the second half of the film. Rather that simply serve a
story of horror and torture, Laugier digs deeper into the human mind.
The idea behind Martyrs is not futile nor easily forgotten. There's a
whole point to the film, elevating is above all its reference points
(Saw and Hostel - sadly enough).Martyrs is in a whole different league and is everything a film like
Funny Games should have been. A definite assault to the gut, extremely
graphic and to the point, without ever flinching or resolving to silly
tricks to get a point across. It's a film only a director with love for
the genre could make (remember that Mr Haneke, after two pointless
attempts) and Laugier doesn't let down.Visually, the film is well shot, though nothing out of the ordinary.
The make-up on the other hand deserves some praise, same as the leading
ladies who play their parts with conviction and depth (at one point
Anna even shows a creepy resemblance to Falconetti in Jeanne d'Arc) .
Essential to the film and certainly not an easy task.Don't watch Martyrs to get a little horror kick, or to indulge in silly
gorefests. This film will not deliver the fun thrills of regular horror
movies, on the contrary. It's a bleak, depressive but all the more
impressive look in the darker depths of the human condition, it will
leave you cringing in your seat and it will make you want to look away.
And it does so without ever numbing you down.One of the most impressive films I've seen this year, a definite
favorite and one that'll receive my further support through a DVD
purchase, though I have no idea when or if I'll watch it again. Laugier
uses every bit of skill he has to make Martyrs as painful as possible,
and reaches further than any other has. A very solid 4.5*/5.0*, though
no recommendation from my side. Definitely not a film for everyone.",99,2008
1600,9.0,5.7,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***That was the first movie that put me to sleep. For the first time in my
life I wanted to leave the cinema. I went to see a Christmas comedy and
saw Christmas tragedy. Such a stupid plot!!! Why all these people
should be so sad and depressed?! I get the main idea of all miserable
members of this family getting united at the end. BUT i can't
understand why is necessary to be such slow and dramatic storyline. The
main characters with their 35 years old marrage are going to devorse
because they didn't go to Africa. They had so much fights all the time
because of that and when the woman said ""Ok, let's go to Africa"", he
said ""No, let's stay"" Really?!?! The sister Emma... she was at the back
seat of the police car for 70 minutes and was having such pathetic
conversation with the officer; the movie is 105 minutes! The
daughter... why she and the soldier guy were walking around the airport
for 50 minuts of the movie, talking so much nonsense? She is so much
hurt and couldn't love again, but she has a ralationship with married
man and she fall in love with the solider boy in 5 minutes... There is
a son that couldn't buy a presents for his kids because he has no money
but he is hiding that fact, there are two terrible teenagers making out
in every corner, there is this waitress that tried to kill herself
because he mother is an alcoholic... This movie killed my Christmas
spirit :( The trailer is far away from the real story. People, please
don't watch it, it will depress you... P.S. The only nice thing in this
movie is the cute dog",107,2015
1601,7.25,3.4,"There is a reason I don't watch many slasher movies, and movies like
""Hayride"" are exactly the reason. It's not that I expect something new
or mind blowing, but sometimes I just wish more creativity was present.
And maybe more care. I can't for the life of me imagine anything that
would be more boring in the world of film than to sit down and write a
slasher script. What would be the point, even? Evidently there are
people who just love it, and that love making them, and ""Hayride"" is
just feeding it with the same snooze.
Besides being based on the redneck version of Haunted Houses, ""Hayride""
is dressed in the same cloth as any other ""masked-killer-returns""
horrors from late 70's an onwards. The movie is set on Halloween, and a
guy is returning home just in time for the Haunted Hayride. He is
bringing his girlfriend, but has made sure she understands where she's
going, telling her about his uncle, as well as his uncle's favorite
story to tell: the legend of Pitchfork. Pitchfork is said to be out
there looking for his daughter who ran away, but is the legend really
true? Pitchfork is the main focus on the Haunted Hayride. The only
problem is that the Pitchfork mask is gone, and little do they don't
know that someone else is taking upon the role of Pitchfork. Or is it
the real Pitchfork?
How did I do? Did I scare you enough? Did I build up lots of tension?
Did you start to question whether the legend is real or not? The movie
sure didn't do any of that. Now, it's not as bad as some backyard
flicks in its production, but at least those you can accept for the
fact that they are made with little care to begin with. ""Hayride"" is
low budget, sure, but it has the bland characters, unimaginative
antagonist and yawn-inducing violence that has nothing to do with
production values. There are some issues in the production values
themselves, but that's nothing new. You're quite prepared for stale
performances, day-for-night shots, pointlessly added CGI rain and blood
squirts, and so on. It's not really an issue for the movie. Of course,
it doesn't help it either.
The movie does try to give us a justified back story, and to its credit
it's not terrible. But they tell it in a really cheesy way, with an
overly stylized frame around the flashback, and it's really pushing it
in length. The story itself, that Pitchfork is out there looking for
his daughter that ran away, and killing everyone in the way, isn't too
shabby at all. It might not break new ground, but it's at least on par
with some much superior movies' back stories. And that's quite a
compliment, I think.
The kills in the movie are often nothing attention-worthy. I did enjoy
one kill somewhat: when someone wearing a cheap Jason Voorhees mask is
hit in the face with an axe, and the mask sticks to the axe. Even
that's stretching it. But I guess it's a simple thing to do, but was
creative enough to stand out in an otherwise lackluster slasher. The
amount of gore and blood isn't great, but it's enough for me to not be
overly annoyed about it, and just little enough so that I don't take
much notice.
""Hayride"" might appeal to some huge slasher fans. We're talking about
those who also love the hell out of the post-""Scream"" phase that ended
sometime in the early 00's. ""Hayride"" isn't much more than that, and
probably worse than many of them. It's more in style with ""Friday the
13th"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (if you only count the chase scenes
towards the end) than ""Scream"", but you get the point. It's a slasher
flick in 2013 (2012), and it does absolutely nothing to break the mold.",0,2012

1603,1.0,4.9,"Okay, so let me just say. If you know anything about writer/director
David A. Prior, then you know exactly what you're getting into when you
sit down to watch one of his films. He is one of those filmmakers that
seems to deliver ultra-low-budget trash, but in such a charming and
entertaining way that most of the ones I've seen from him ultimately
become So Bad, It's Good cult classics, with Killer Workout and the
original Deadly Prey being his crowning achievements. I love Deadly
Prey. It's one of those films that just gets everything right in an
entertainingly bad movie, and though it's been 27 years, his follow- up
sequel does not disappoint. First off, not only does original writer/director Prior return, but
most of the original cast does as well, which surprised the hell out of
me. Not only that, it seems that decades experience has not helped
Prior become a better filmmaker, and thank the heavens for that! This
sequel, which ""kind of"" plays out like a near identical remake of the
original, but also as it's own thing entirely in a weird way, delivers
the goods just as well as the first one did. I honestly didn't think
that was possible, but let me tell you, it does. It just hits all the
right notes for a So Bad, It's Good low- budget action flick. There is
so much to laugh at, and so many WTF? moments that you will no doubt be
highly entertained from beginning to end.",80,2013
1604,12.0,4.5,"This is a very uneven movie.On the one hand, it's not bad for an independent movie with a tiny
budget. The settings is pretty nice and the actors are OK.The movie is an obvious reference to ""The Thing"" and it uses practical
effects and no CGI. And here lies the first problem: The effects aren't
impressive. From a company that deals with practical effects, which has
some veteran effects guys and lots of experience, I expected more. A
lot more. The effects here only show how amazing Rob Bottin's work was
over 30 years ago. I also expected the effects to be a lot more
explicit, yet I always got the feeling they try to hide them by shaking
the camera, cutting, putting something in front, etc.The last problem has to do with direction: It's pretty obvious that
this is the work of a first time director/writer - The movie is very
uneven, there are good scenes and bad scenes, there are continuity
problems, coverage problems, editing problems, things that simply don't
connect and hard to understand what the director meant to do and also
many scenes that seem to be missing a dialog.All in all, this is a so-so movie for something independent without a
budget. I expected more and I'm a bit disappointed, but I'd still think
it's worth a watch, at least for the effort.",82,2015

1606,10.25,5.9,"""Freaks of Nature"" is a comedy/horror movie that actually works for a
change! It takes place in Dillford, Anywhere, USA, where humans,
vampires, and zombies live side-by-side and actually get along, that
is, until some aliens decide to pay them a visit. With each ""clan""

is cocksure the luscious Lorelei, who keeps visiting him, will be the
girl to end his virginity. Trouble is, Lorelei only ""visits"" because
she keeps her dope at his house. Petra (also wonderfully played by
Mackenzie Davis) is a hopeless and hapless girl who has had to carry an
out-and-out lie about her character since she was 10. She unfortunately
falls for the lines of a lascivious vampire who, once he turns her,
stops taking her phone calls. Ned (superbly played by Josh Fadem) is a
brainiac who wants to keep his straight A school record in tact so he
can get a scholarship to an Ivy League school. When he feels he has
nothing to live for, he decides to become a zombie. His slow
transformation is a scream! Little do they know their town's future

nice. I think they simply missed the point of this movie. Yes, the plot

1607,12.0,5.7,"Though individually modest compared to the bloody affairs of horror
movies these days, the sum of their parts provides a uniquely
entertaining and accurate sampling of horror films of the early '80s.
With four short stories addressing different areas of terror, from
serial killers to giant rats, Joseph Sargent's Nightmares showcases a
nostalgic spattering of the genre and an amusing range of highs and
lows in substance and style. Chapter one (Terror in Topanga) sets an appropriately foreboding mood
as a maniacal serial killer is loosed upon the small town of Topanga.
Recalling urban legends and classic slashers, the deranged William
Henry Glazer is out on a killing spree and young Lisa (Cristina Raines)
decides a pack of cigarettes is worth risking her life for. Spouting
the now cliché horror film line ""I'll be right back,"" Lisa proceeds to
embark on a drive alone at night and winds up in a deadly predicament.
A wise segment to open the film with, Terror in Topanga ably represents
the sub-genre of slasher flicks with a pervasive atmosphere of paranoia
and isolation. The second chapter (The Bishop of Battle) is perhaps the most famous
and features a young Emilio Estevez as J.J. Cooney, a video game
hustler determined to take on the arcade game Bishop and reach the
elusive Level 13. Sporting cheesy '80s special effects and a sinister
green head for a villain, The Bishop of Battle cleverly plays off of
obsessions and the fear of technological takeover. A virtual reality
invasion of the real world and a convincing performance from Estevez
make this the most engaging chapter.Easily the weakest in both story and thrills, chapter three
(Benediction) finds Lance Henriksen as a priest who loses his faith
after a tragic event. Told with a multitude of traumatic dreams and
sullen flashbacks, Benediction plays out like a weaker version of
1977's The Car, only this time the devil's choice of transport is a
large black truck. Henriksen is capable as always, but the terror is
light and short-lived  even for a short film. Chapter four returns to good form in Night of the Rat, a killer rodent
story revolving around the consequences of messing with Mother Nature
and the task of confronting your own fears. The suspenseful buildup is
by far its greatest asset, as a climax featuring disappointing special
effects and laughable solutions leaves much to be desired. Paranoia, obsession, faith, and obstinance all merge with entertaining
examples of the horror genre's many facets to produce an effective
representation of the thrillers of the time. By today's standards
you'll likely be spared any real nightmares as a result of viewing this
'80s gem, but it's still worth the visit to a period of innovation over
gory visuals. - Joel Massie",99,1983
1608,15.0,4.7,"This could have been a great movie. Yes, the synopsis might sound
corny, but the potential was there for something dark, mysterious,
subtle and of course creepy as hell. The Google Glass thing worked for
me (although it might annoy some), as did movies in the same ""genre""
like CloverField and Creep. If you've been to Jerusalem, you'll get
memories coming back at you during this movie. Lots of beautiful
footage. Apart from that, the movie lost me with its inconsistencies,
lack of balance, superficial take on the Jewish mythology and a
storyline which was either gimmicky or not credible.From the start, we could feel the storyline was forced with the intro
and the numerous signs that announced Jerusalem was going down with a
boom. The visuals were nothing exceptional, and the Paz Brothers
could've achieved much more with less demons. A giant? Really?The characters' action often left me bemused, with the IDF straying
away from their mission to escort a girl in the asylum (not happening
in real life, ever.) Omar killing himself (pretty pointless), the
soldiers NOT shooting the demons, psycho-David hiding under a table...
Also, it felt like the main character was either calling out names,
crying or saying : ""I'm sorry"", which made her more annoying than
anything else, although I suspect she hardly had any help from the
script, which is nothing to write home about.The lost brother storyline added very little to the movie, beside
getting a guy blowing his opportunity at getting head (pun intended), a
crying scene and a funny joke at the Western Wall. It could have been
easily left out, had it not intervene at the very end, in a manner that
was simply uncalled for.Finallt, the movie left me asking for more, with an ending that wanted
itself shocking, but fell short of the terror this movie was promising.",0,2015
1609,4.666666666666667,6.7,"I didn't expect too much from the film Grandma, but it ended up being
quite a pleasant surprise. Its story is simple and it barely covers one
day in the life of the characters, but it works as an adequate frame of
a genuine character study, in which even the most trivial events (like
buying a coffee or taking a taxi) reveal new aspects and hidden
emotions from the characters. I suppose that the tragicomic adventures
from an irascible grandma and her granddaughter touring a city looking
for money (500 dollars) might not seem particularly attractive material
for many spectators, but as I previously said, the point of the movie
is gradually drawing the endearing relationship both of them develop
with each other, also extending to the granddaughter's mother,
perfectly played by Marcia Gay Harden. I would also like to mention the
solid works from Elizabeth Peña in her last performance; and Judy
Greer, one of my favorite actresses, finally playing a role which takes
advantage of her huge talent. Lily Tomlin seems to improve with the age
(something which is already a big compliment), facing mature roles with
dignity and without losing a pinch of the intensity and energy which
have always distinguished her, while Julia Garner also makes an
excellent work as the granddaughter while having a perfect chemistry
with Tomlin. In conclusion, Grandma is a ""small"" movie, made with very
little money (supposedly 600,000 dollars) and which received minimum
publicity, but I enjoyed it pretty much, and I recommend it as a solid
and satisfactory film.",79,2015
1610,4.666666666666667,7.0,"I saw this film a couple of times when it aired on cable, and didn't
really know who the director was at the time. I recognized Spalding
Gray, as I had seen at least one other of his one-man monologue
movie/shows that pop up every now and again on TV. His style of telling
stories is sardonic, sad, a tinge in the cynical, always pointing out
idiosyncrasies when he can, and always with a sense of the truth. When
I found out that this particular one, Gray's Anatomy, was directed by
Steven Soderbergh, it finally made sense. Because the style of the
project fits the rest of the director's oeuvre without a misstep. It
might not be one his great films, but he makes material that should, in
what would really be the right reason, be on a stage somewhere
off-Broadway (not off-off but not on it either) into something much
more compelling for the screen. He uses a combination of varied angles,
experimental lighting with colored filters, lenses, the lengths messed
up, and messes with light and dark. His DP, Elliot Davis, also a very
good asset on Out of Sight, makes this a key part of the engrossment
(or what might be for others a distance) in the material. And of course
the editing makes one pay attention to bits more closely than others,
or accentuates some of the points that Gray makes. The music chimes in
unconventionally as well. In this particular case, Gray is talking about health, but more than
anything his own as he goes through the process of going to doctors,
finding out his illness, getting it cured, et all. But it's not really
all that simple, due to some of Gray's own neuroses and other bits of
problems that come up, one or two his though mostly on the end of the
eccentric doctors and others along his trip. This is not all, however,
because through this story of fixing a real medical problem, it
off-shoots into bits of topics about New York, Judaism, and his family.
Soderbergh understands more than anything the mind-set of a guy like
Gray, what he might have had, and the best a director like he can do is
keep up with the sparks in the material. It's a good one man-show given
better directorial treatment. It flirts with overkill in the style
(only so much one man can take even in 80 minutes), but in the end
after seeing it more than once I felt comfortable not just with the
style but, more importantly, Gray himself. It's like style in a
three-legged race to the finish with the substance, as the quirks in
each threaten to tumble on another over. And, to be sure, it's under
the radar enough in the indie-world to keep its ambitions only so
reaching. B+",80,1996
1611,14.0,5.5,"For those who like to nitpick, there are tons of continuity problems in this
film from what was established in the other films. As a fan of the series,
I noticed many of them myself during the first viewing. But if you look
past all that, this truly is a fantastic film. More of a sequel to the
original than to ""Psycho III"" (although they sort-of mention the last one),
we get the backstory on Norma Bates -- the overbearing mother that drove her
son insane. Told through flashback sequences while Norman is reminiscing to
a radio-show host, this film delved into the mind of the man who's
remembered as a monster and made him more of a sympathetic character --
though I think everyone who likes the series already took sympathy on the
poor man. And we finally get to see what makes a madman
mad....Perkins, as always, was in top form playing the character that killed his
career. Olivia Hussey was brilliant in the role of Norma. Hussey's
performance was riveting -- kind and loving one moment, cruel and loathing
the next -- a schizophrenic delight to watch. Henry Thomas did a wonderful
job playing the young Norman, showing what the character was like before he
went totally over the edge. And CCH Pounder as the radio-host with a heart
gives a fantastic performance as the woman who knew what was going on but
was helpless to do anything about it....Now on to the gripes that people keep bringing up.... Yes, there are
inconsistancies with events as they were described in the other films. But
he's on a radio show -- does anyone who knows they're on the radio really
tell the whole truth? Olivia Hussey has gotten flack for her accent --
though they never really say anywhere that she's American. Granted, the
woman who played her sister in II & III didn't have an accent, but she's not
really mentioned here.... And Henry Thomas has gotten reamed for not acting
enough like Perkins did in the original -- but the first film took place
after the events that occurred in this one. People do change and by the
time the first film took place, he was totally off the deep end. If you
forget about II & III and don't mind the incest themes, this is a wonderful
sequel.Finally, why isn't this one on DVD yet? The other three films have been on
DVD for a while, including the cropped-screen release of III. I'd like to

1613,8.333333333333334,7.4,"Columbia Picture's epic adventure THE PROFESSIONAS (1966) is a classic
western and ranks among my top ten favourites. But for some strange
reason this exciting colourful romp is often omitted from ""great
westerns"" discussions. Perhaps it's the setting - or the fact of it not
having the quintessential unknown cow-town that is marshaled by an
idealistic but embattled lawman who along with his crotchety old deputy
is in constant conflict with the powerful local rancher and his
cowhands. And climaxing with the rancher sending for the fast gun to
take on the Marshall. Of course with many variations these things are
usually the ingredients of the classic western. But not so with THE
PROFESSIONALS. Here we have an almost complete Mexican setting and four
men - each with their individual skills - contracted to rescue a big
rancher's wife being held by bandits south of the border. Based on the
novel by Frank O'Rourke this completely engaging, beautifully
constructed action packed adventure was written for the screen and
expertly directed by Richard Brooks. The Oscar nominated Panavision
cinematography came from the great Conrad Hall.With an offer of $10,000 each, mighty rancher(Ralph Bellamy) hires four
specialists - lead by Lee Marvin - to rescue his kidnapped much younger
wife Maria (Claudia Cardinale) from the clutches of bandit leader Jesus
Raza (Jack Palance). ""Jesus - what a name.... for the bloodiest
cutthroat in Mexico"" declares Bellamy. Burt Lancaster is the explosives
expert. Robert Ryan is the Wrangler and Woody Strode an expert with
Long Bow. On the journey Lancaster is asked his plan with the
explosives. With a wry smile he explains ""Well I'll tell ye
brother.....if we ever do get back to this canyon, I'll light this
fuse...... we'll have ten seconds to get the hell out....and then
dynamite, not faith, will move this mountain into that pass.... peace
brother"". When they eventually do manage to infiltrate the bandit's
lair they set the charges and blow the place up but to their shock they
find that Maria and Raza are lovers after all (""Brother we've been
had"") and doesn't want to be rescued. Forcibly taking her with them
anyway they make a dash for the border with Raza's men in hot pursuit.
After an exciting train chase and a terrific canyon gunfight they
finally make it back to the rancher's meeting point with Maria and a
wounded Raza. The picture ends with Marvin preventing Bellamy from
killing Raza (""You haven't earned the right to kill him"" Lancaster
declares) and then sending Maria and Raza back to Mexico together on a
buckboard.Performances are terrific! Although Lancaster has top billing, Marvin
has the leading role. He is the main protagonist around whom all the
action centres and he turns in a splendid stern faced portrayal of the
conscientious director of the operation. But disappointing is Robert
Ryan who gives a rather subdued performance in a surprisingly
underwritten role. Lancaster, on the other hand, is a total delight to
watch and steals every scene he's in. This marked a very welcome return
to form for the actor and brings to mind his much loved swashbuckling
roles in ""The Flame & The Arrow"" (1950) and ""The Crimson Pirate""
(1952). Excellent too is Jack Palance in the unusual role of Raza the
Mexican bandit leader and also the stunning Claudia Cardinale in her
first American movie. Adding great atmosphere to the whole thing is the
infectious music by Maurice Jarre. The french composer's score abounds
with wonderful indigenous Mexican folk tunes giving the picture an
engaging south of the border feel.THE PROFESSIONALS is a top notch western adventure. A sublime and well
polished example of the genre that has lost none of its sheen in almost
forty five years.Memorable exchange from THE PROFESSIONALS ;Marvin to Lancaster, who is clad only in long-johns ""You'll have to
give up this practice of always losing your pants.....it's
undignified"". And Lancaster's response "" Yeah... it's drafty too"".",117,1966
1614,12.2,7.4,"An incredible film. There is so much going on and so much symbolism, the
viewer cannot afford to miss a single moment. The great difficulty with
attempting to make sense of most post WWII film noirs is that it is nearly
impossible to relate to either the time in general or the turmoil the
protagonist is going through after between one and three years in the
somewhat surreal situation of extended combat. Attempting to `assimilate'
to society can be extremely difficult. Many 'Nam vets can relate. At the
time the film was made, just about everyone could relate because if they
were not attempting to `assimilate' they knew someone who was.The title comes from a scene where Lucky (Montgomery) wants to give Pilar
(Hendrix) a free ride on Pancho's (Gomez) merry-go-round. Pilar asks
Lucky
which horse to ride and he replies, `Try the pink one'. What the
merry-go-round is a metaphor of each viewer can decide. However, Pancho
may
give us a clue when during this exchange he states he gives no free
rides.Lucky is the typical movie G. I., brusque, rude and tougher than nails
with
apparently no real direction in life as evidenced by his cheap, rumpled
suit
and extremely free spending. Most assume he is out to revenge the killing
of his war buddy, Shorty, by a gangster (Clark). Lucky is considered
stupid
because he could blackmail the gangster for much more than he is asking
and
essentially set himself up for life. However, Lucky recently left an
environment where there was no guarantee of life beyond the moment. Is
his
motive actually revenge or could he be looking for something else? He
recently survived a situation where his friends died on a regular basis
and
there was little or no opportunity for revenge. Can he even relate to
revenge? You decide. At the end of the movie Lucky works out in his own
mind a means of satisfying his motives. Enough said.Pancho is the wise sage who periodically illuminates a situation with his
light, off handed comments. The scheming, femme fatale (King) has a minor
role, which is refreshing. However, the character who literally steals
the
show is Pilar a young, inexperienced, poor Indian girl who seems to mature
into adulthood during the course of a few days. She attaches herself to
Lucky at the beginning of the movie. The symbolism associated with her
frequently appearing from behind buildings, out of alleys and hearing
things
no one else does is very strong and adds a true sense of mystery to the
character. Retz ( blacklisted Art Smith), a government agent, and Pilar
are
often found protecting Lucky from himself. Pilar later explains to Retz
that she befriended Lucky because she saw death in his face. Pilar
assumes
the `death' she saw is in the future but it could very well be that Lucky,
after extended combat, is living a type of death at that moment. One of
the
movie's most compelling scenes is at the end when Lucky, knowing full well
what he owes Pilar, has great difficulty determining how to say good-bye.
Retz knows Lucky is struggling. Pilar, having greatly matured,
understands
either Lucky's predicament or `the facts of life' and handles the
situation
with the maturity of one well beyond her years. The beatings Pancho and
Pilar take rather than betray Lucky also have strong symbolism, the weak
defying the strong and eventually prevailing. Keep in mind this is
1947.This is an extremely powerful movie that leaves so many questions
unanswered, one cannot help but wonder long after the movie is over about
what lead up to this small piece of Lucky's life, what was actually
occurring during the movie and Lucky and Pilar's future.",101,1947

1616,9.75,6.9,"Sylvester Stallone is excellent in this slow-moving, absorbing film about
cops on the take. Sly goes through what must be one of the longest
slow-burns in movie history as the dumb, passive sheriff who only has his
job thanks to the grace of crooked cop Harvey Keitel and protects him and
his gang because of it. When it finally dawns on him, as it was inevitable
it would, that he's been played for a fool, the results are explosive. It's
well written, with a strong storyline, great dialogue and excellent
performances all round (especially from Robert de Niro, Keitel and Ray
Liotta). But it stands or falls on Stallone's portrayal of the central
character, and he rises surprisingly majestically to the occasion. A very
restrained, sensitive performance in a cracking good film.",105,1997

College and recruits seven black players to lead them to the top.Right from the trailers and the posters, you probably know how ""Glory
Road"" is gonna go: an underdog NCAA basketball team must face great
odds to win the championship. It's a sports movie based from true
events (read: based) with a Hollywood tag plastered over its forehead
that features reluctant heroes overcoming their problems and giving it
all for the game. Nonetheless, the movie achieves more than that. While this Jerry Bruckheimer-produced Disney movie plot is typical
(remember the Titans?), the underlying socio-political theme
effectively presents the ills of racism - a problem with no easy way
out of (ask Paul Haggis). The key characters of the game are dealing
with discrimination and the only way they can get back is to win. Of
course, a little research told me that some of the details about the
real events were changed for cinematic purposes. It's completely fine
by me as long as the end product justifies the means. And boy it does.
The performances are also good. Josh Lucas gives a terrific performance
as Don Haskins, the head coach of the team that featured the first
all-black starting lineup in US NCAA history.""Glory Road"" is a formulaic yet an enjoyable film. It's a movie that
gives itself away as soon as one character says ""I want to play,
Coach!"" Still it has charm and excitement that comes from seeing it for
what it is. It's predictable, yeah, but it's not much different from
seeing a replay of a game where your favorite team won.",118,2006

1621,12.5,6.6,"Kings Go Forth is one of, maybe the only, film about the Allied
offensive in Southern France in late summer of 1944. Several divisions
who were fighting in Italy under Mark Clark were sent to invade France
from the south. The action as compared to the larger shows movie east
from Normandy and north up the Italian peninsula was light as the
Germans were retreating to protect their own borders. It was called the
champagne offensive because it was as you see it with Frank Sinatra and
Tony Curtis, fighting one minute, and on a weekend pass the next.Frank Sinatra narrates the story with him as one of the protagonists.
He's an army lieutenant and he's just gotten some replacements for his
company, one of them being Tony Curtis. Curtis is a spoiled rich kid, a
real smooth operator. But he turns out to be a good soldier and he and
Sinatra become friends despite Sinatra being an officer and Curtis
non-com. Then the two of them get interested in the same girl, Natalie Wood.
She's an American expatriate living with her widowed mother, Leora
Dana. Her father was a black man and they left the United States many
years before to escape ruling prejudices. Ironic that they escape to
France and then France gets occupied by the real prejudice merchants.The film is divided equally, half of it concerning the war and half of
it dealing with the romantic triangle. For the second time in his
career, the first being in Sweet Smell of Success, Tony Curtis plays a
heel and does it well. Curtis was really coming into his own as a
player and not just a pretty face. Kings Go Forth was filmed on the
heels of his Oscar nominated performance in The Defiant Ones.Frank Sinatra gives one of his best screen performances in Kings Go
Forth. None of the hipster slang, not the nebbish of his forties
musicals, Sinatra plays a really good man trying to deal with his own
inner conflicts about what he's been brought up to believe and the
feelings he has for Wood. It's something different and Sinatra does it
well.Natalie Wood was as beautiful as they come and Leora Dana as her mother
who's seen too much of the world and is determined to protect her
daughter has some of her best screen moments. Tony Curtis liked working
with Natalie Wood very much in the films they made together, but he
does mention in his autobiography it would have really been great if
someone like Dorothy Dandridge had been cast in her role. It might have
made Kings Go Forth better remembered today, as much as classic as
Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.Elmer Bernstein did the film score and one of the themes was given a
lyric by Sammy Cahn and became the song Monique after Natalie Wood's
character. Frank Sinatra made a hit record of it though it is only
heard instrumentally in the film. It's one of his loveliest ballads.Viewers should see the film before hearing Sinatra's record of it. The
whole premise of the film is the plain Sinatra and the smooth Curtis
competing for Wood. You hear old Blue Eyes sing Monique and you'll find
it hard to believe why he didn't just sing that song. Why Natalie would have melted right away in his arms.",109,1958

for you.The film will get you in a state of mind that will begin to think, to
wonder. Will this be possible? Can a father be like that? Loving and
still so demanding and ... cruel. And then you realize that it's the way people, mostly men, dictates
their women and children to live exactly as they want them to do. It
also shows how hard it is to break free from a family bond. Hard even
if you don't want to be a part of it, if you do want to go. You can't
go, there is too much holding you back. Fear, love, obedience even
respect holds you back from leaving although you don't want to be
there. You know what you have but you don't know what you will get.For me the film was not about their ability to ""jump"". It was about the
fear of something new, something you don't understand, the will to have
everything as it always have been. Their ability was just the unknown
in the world. The film for me was also about breaking free and leaving

has in one's later life. It is the story of finally finding love and

Amityville Horror. Being a huge horror buff, I just had to and besides
I had only seen some of it's absurd sequels. hearing mixed reviews from
friends and critics from terrifying to hilarious I turned it on with my
boyfriend at the time and prepared myself for something scary. I must
say that I was quite impressed. And although slightly disappointed in
some of the films scenes ultimately I must say this is one old
fashioned scary flick! I can hugely recognize the appeal it had in it's
it's hey day. With the exception of Texas chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead,
the Omen and some others I rarely see what people did in their horror
classics nowadays. Like The Exorcist, pretty damn boring and funny in
my opinion. But getting back to this film. It builds a creeping mood
filled with fright inducing suspense. The effects are simple but
effective and the performances are somewhat over the top but
necessarily wacky. The film's overall lasting appeal has little to do
with the film's apparent campiness. it has more to do with the real
terror inducing legend that inspired it. Like the Chainsaw remake the
new ones looks to amp up the horror and intensity which would be
greatly welcomed. Although a great horror classic Amityville's finale
is somewhat anti climactic and after a long and impressively scary
build-up it fails to deliver the end goods. But whoa some of the scenes
from the imaginary friend Jody flying out the window, to the visitor at
the door, to the voice in the house and just everything in the basement

1625,7.5,2.8,"It's amazing how fast a successful trend is copied in Hollywood.
Filmmakers and studios just jump on the bandwagon to make some bucks.
The ""found footage"" concept is one that has been the subject of many
recent Horror films. It began most effectively with the controversial
1980 film 'Cannibal Holocaust.' In 1999, audiences around the world
were terrified by 'The Blair Witch Project,' which too used this
gimmick. Since then there have been many more examples of this, ranging
from quite good to forgettable junk. It appears the next chapter in
this trend is making sequels to once successful franchises using this
gimmick. I have to say, it's not exactly getting off to a great start.Pros: Actors do the best they can. At 79 minutes, the film never drags.
Fans of the series may dig the homages to the original, including the
flies. Making a kid the protagonist is something rare in Horror.Cons: Perfunctory script. Brings nothing new to the table. Opening
sequence has little to do with rest of the film. Lame attempts at
scares. Crap visual effects. Tries to tie a real life murder case,
specifically The Benson Murders, to the Amityville house. Supposed to
be set in the original house, but they didn't even try to find a
look-alike.Final thoughts: Just another useless sequel, which is no surprise. The
fact that it's made by The Asylum should give some indication about
it's quality. It's not as bad as the painful 'Paranormal Entity,' but
still deserves to collect dust on the shelf. Sure we didn't need the
other sequels either, but a lot more imagination was put into those.My rating: 1.5/5",86,2011

police & returned back to the home),Abner,undaunted tries again,this
time getting further,with the help of a taxi cab driver,to his old farm
land. Problem is,the land & the house are now leased by Lonzo Choat,who
Abner doesn't like,one bit. Abner takes up in the workers quarters,just
off the main house,much to the chagrin of Lonzo, who wants Abner off of
his property,a.s.a.p. The following makes for a tense tale,that you
know is going to end up badly. Scott Teem ('A Death In The
Woods','Roots') directs & writes the screenplay,adapted from the novel,
'I Hate To See The Evening Sun Go Down',by William Gay (the title of
which is taken from a line in an old country blues song by Jimmy
Rogers). This is a quiet little independent film that in the wrong
hands would have turned out to be just another Southern exploitation
film (like the kind of films produced by Harry Novak that used to play
drive in's back in the 1970's that stereotyped all of the citizens of
the South as back woods,slack jawed,inbred,boozing,village idiots that
would have sex with farm animals,or family members,or all of the
above),but rises above that. The great Hal Holbrook (forever known for
his portrayal of Mark Twain on stage & screen)plays Abner,a man who
just wants what is rightly his. Ray McKinnon is Lonzo,a man who is just
dripping with contempt for Abner. The rest of the cast (unknown by
yours truly)turn in shining roles on screen. This is a quiet,little
""indie"" that drew acclaim at the festivals,but probably won't get much
in the way of main steam distribution (I got to see it at one of our

entirety, for the first time since. This means that I'm completely
discounting the horribly butchered version I saw on Bravo (for shame!)
a year or so ago. They didn't just bleep out the expletives as you
would expect, whole scenes were cut, leaving the work so diluted I
almost forgot why I had loved it. It was like Jaws without teeth!Revisiting books, films or any work of art first experienced in youth
can be very interesting, and I found that watching The Last Detail
through my now (# unspecified!) year-old eyes was one of the many times
something turned out to be even better the second time around. I guess
that makes it a classic. For those that don't know, this is the story of two career enlisted
Navy men who are assigned the dreary detail of delivering a young
seaman to prison in Portsmouth, NH, where he will serve an eight year
sentence for attempting to swipe $40 from their commanding officer's
wife's favorite charity box. It's obvious that poor Meadows, played by
Randy Quaid, has been thrown to the dogs for his offense, receiving a
dishonorable discharge from the service in addition to the excessive
prison term, but this is the Navy and our boys must do as ordered. It's
a sh*t detail, but it will take them out of their insulated and
listless existence on base ""in transition"" - that is, waiting for
assignment to sea duty - and they quickly formulate a plan to relieve
themselves of their charge as fast as possible and spend the bulk of
the allotted time and money remaining to party the way good sailors do,
namely drinking and whoring. Enter young Meadows, and the master plan takes on a life of its own as
the seemingly hardened ""Bad Ass"" Buddusky (Jack Nicholson) and ""Mule""
Mulhall (Otis Young) find themselves caught up in Naval-infused
fraternity with the childlike Meadows. Resigned to his fate, the
hapless swabbie's frustrating passivity is fuel to Baddusky's
pugnacious nature, and Mulhall and Meadows are swept along with Chief
Signalman Bad Ass on a journey of discovery. From teaching him how to
get his hamburger served the way he likes it (with the cheese MELTED,
thank you very much), to facilitating the loss of his virginity (Carol
Kane is perfect as the young prostitute), this is really a ""buddy""
movie at its finest. In the final frames, we watch the two lifers stroll out of the shot in
lock-step, ""Anchors Aweigh"" piping, as they're off to reestablish
themselves as individuals for a brief moment before returning to the
shelter of their sacred family that is the US Navy.There's nothing sappy about this film, don't get me wrong. There's a
definite hard edge to it and life as a Naval enlisted man is not
romanticized in any way. Visually, it's quite somber from our side of
the screen, and the military music in the score is to music, as the
military justice in the story is to justice. There are some fabulously
funny moments, and of course, Nicholson kills in this part that no one
could have played better. Otis Young is really good as the ""cooler
head"" who doesn't want to get himself jammed up in any way but who is
none the less down with showing Meadows a good time. It's Randy Quaid
though, who impressed me most on this viewing. He played the ingenuous,
candy bar-filching boy just right, and I'm afraid in retrospect that he
got typecast as the big, goofy dumb guy as a result of his work in this
picture.I loved everything about this movie, wouldn't change a thing.Oh, and just for the heck of it... here's a little movie/Navy trivia
tidbit I found online when I looked up Portsmouth Naval Prison. I have
no idea whether there's any truth to it or not, but when I came across
it three different times, I decided to add it here. This is from
""Humphrey Bogart: To Have and Have Not"", by Daniel Bubbeo.""...Bogart's long time friend, author Nathaniel Benchley, claims it is
true that Bogart was injured while on assignment to take a naval
prisoner to Portsmouth Naval Prison in New Hampshire. Supposedly, while
changing trains in Boston, the handcuffed prisoner asked Bogart for a
cigarette and while Bogart looked for a match, the prisoner raised his
hands, smashed Bogart across the mouth with his cuffs, cutting Bogart's
lip, and fled. Bogart used his .45 to drop the prisoner, who was
eventually taken to Portsmouth. By the time Bogie was treated by a
doctor, the scar that caused him to lisp had already formed.""Wow, huh? SO much better than say, getting hit in the mouth with a

a challenging story really well. If you've never seen the Australian outback or met a few of its

wish more time had been devoted to their relationship, because the
conflicts, challenges and unspoken reserve that underpinned the
subtleties of this part of the tale deserved more. Emma Hamilton as
Julie, a backpacker from London working at the Daly Waters pub shone in
the subtle sensitivity of her character. Tilly, a young indigenous man
and fellow traveller didn't convince with the clichéd predictability of
his dialogue and actions, but provided some funny moments and several
useful plot components. Jackie Weaver as pioneering GP Dr Nicole Farmer

planning on seeing it, chances are you have already seen Pascal
Laugier's 2008 original and know what's up. In fact, it's probably not
inaccurate to say that the only people who may be seeing this film are
those already acquainted with the source material, as this remake had
virtually zero publicity, a sad excuse of a theatrical release, and a
buzz that was DOA. By most accounts, this remake of ""Martyrs"" was doomed by the mere fact
of it being a remake; it's difficult to outdo something with as much
palpable intensity and thematic abhorrence as the original film. and
that's precisely where this film most falls flat. There is an
inexplicable feeling of shallowness to the picture that pervades it
from nearly beginning to end. Part of it is the lackluster
cinematography, and part of it is the lack of dynamism in the
performances, but most of all, it feels like the filmmakers in general
were dispassionate about the material itself, and it shows.The truth is, a remake could have worked, but it would have needed at
least a little life breathed into it, and this film feels like it was
taken off life support from day one. The script here is near identical
to the original film's, and it begins as a near shot-for-shot remake,
but falls off that train within the first ten minutes. In fact, the
film only really begins to diverge in the final act, which is honestly
where I found the it to be most convincing. I may be the minority here,
but I actually thought the way they rewrote the conclusion was clever
and intriguing without being too much of a touchy-feely tradeoffit
still maintained the dark nerve of the original's ending, which I
respected, and the last five minutes may be the only portion of the
film that I truly thought was worthwhile.The acting here is decent, but the lead female actresses at times seem
to be going through the motions. Some obtuse dialogue doesn't exactly
help matters either. Kate Burton is an interesting and solid choice for
the cultist matriarch, and I actually enjoyed her performance in this
quite a bit. Overall though, ""Martyrs"" only barely begins to scratch the surface of
what the original film did, and it's unfortunate. It fails to capture
any of the remote coldness, psychological disconnect, or stark
brutality that made the original film so unforgettable, and ends up
feeling like little more than a direct-to-video horror flick with about
a fifth of the vitality. When watching the remake, one feels like the
film is self-consciously going through the motions, and when taking
into consideration its stodgy demeanor, failed distribution, and
complete lack of any and all promotion, ""Martyrs"" 2016 ultimately feels
like a production that was given up on before it had even begun. Where
the original was gutsy, stylish, and unsparing, the remake manages to
be the film equivalent of a death rattle. 4/10.",86,2015

thought it's really a gay lesbian movie ).But it was more than that. Once upon a time i was homophobic person. I
hated gays and lesbians more than i hate imaginary gods. I after

good reason. The scenery is gorgeous. Everything else about this movie
is just - meh. The book on which the movie was based was pretty
lightweight, the sort of thing you read on an airplane to kill a couple
of hours. The characters do not translate well to the screen. Most of
them are caricatures. Whoopi Goldberg phones in her usual wisecracking
all-knowing black sidekick; Jane whats-her-name is not somebody you'd
ever find in small-town Virginia, and Jenna Elfman is adorable but
totally wasted. Ashley Judd does her usual generic acting - I can think
of at least ten other actresses who could have brought her character to
life a lot better (Sandra Bullock used to shine in roles like this).
Ashley Judd was around 46 when it was filmed, playing 40 (her character
was 35 in the book). Patrick Wilson is the one true gem in the picture,
he's so freaking yummy. His real-life wife, the luscious Dagmara
Domincyzk, has a bit part as Elizabeth Taylor.You know those original made-for-TV holiday movies they show on ION-TV

the mind-blowing messages; the brilliant blending of poetry, music,
painting, and animation; and the way it propels one's imagination up to
an entirely new level, all the time staying true to the soul of Khalil
Gibran's artistic genius.I highly recommend this exceptional movie to everyone who loves life
and appreciates art in all its forms. Being a sensual mind opener, this
masterpiece succeeds at making the viewer not only enjoy it, but enjoy
existence as a whole too.Hats off to Salma Hayek, Liam Neeson, Gabriel Yared, and of course

1641,8.75,6.5,"Quickie Review:Obsessed with winning the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong (Ben Foster)
uses performance enhancing substances to gain the edge. Meanwhile,
sports journalist David Walsh (Chris O'Dowd) convinced of the doping
conspiracy starts to gather evidence to expose Armstrong. The Program,
is an underwhelming retelling of the one of the biggest drug scandals
in sports history. Admittedly the actor's performances are good, and
the movie overall is shot well. However, the script and the story
telling are to the quality of what you might expect from an average TV
documentary re-enactment.Full Review:Considering the high profile nature of the scandal, I was surprised
that The Program wasn't marketed more. I never saw the trailers in the
cinemas and when I brought up that I was going to watch this movie in
the weekend I was immediately asked by everyone ""What's that?"" After
watching the film it's clear to me that even the studio lacked
confidence in the final product.Few as they may be, there are certainly some redeeming things about The
Program. The lead actor Ben Foster gave a solid performance, at a
certain point I didn't see him anymore and only saw Lance. Which
probably is the biggest compliment I'll give to this movie. I also
enjoyed seeing the whole doping operation, it was meticulous and
systematic. I really got the sense of the lengths that Lance and his
team went to achieve their goals. Although it is definitely
disgraceful, I must admit I was rather impressed by how for so long
they got away with it all. So I commend the filmmakers for pulling off
that aspect of the story. As for the rest of the story, there's more to
be desired.You couldn't ask for better true story material for a sports drama.
There was huge potential here, but all of it is lost because of the
paint by the numbers approach to the film. Rather than concentrating on
a singular character and see them transform over the course of the
movie, The Program opts to also give significant spotlight to David
Walsh and Floyd Landis (Jesse Plemons). This causes the movie to lose
focus with each change. The structure of movie made it blatantly
obvious that the director and the editor prioritised showing a
checklist of major events in Lance's life rather than telling a
coherent story. An example of this false priorities was the
introduction of Lance's wife. The whole segment of them meeting lasts
for about 45 seconds, we get a quick look at a wedding, and that's it,
we never see her again for the rest of the movie. That small segment
was just there to show Lance got married at one point. It felt
completely unnecessary, instead I would love to have seen how this
whole operation affected his relationships and friendships.The Program, is a movie that no-one knows about and unfortunately will
be a forgettable experience for the ones who do watch it. I think if I
had caught this as a re-enacted documentary on TV, I'd be really
impressed. However when it comes to biographically movies in cinemas it
just doesn't hold up to the standard set by recent movies such as The
Social Network or Selma for example.",99,2015
1642,11.2,6.7,"Wow, I can't believe I waited so long to see this film. I just never
got around to watching it. The plot has nothing that interests me. I
know nothing about soccer (football.) I am one of those American fools
that has no clue. I had never even seen David Beckham before this film.
I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was
released in America. Enough about me. Truth be told, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of
movie-making heaven. What a fun film. It's full of color and
exuberance. I had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie.
Parminder Nagra is so sweet and lovable, you can't help but root for
her. No wonder why the American television show E.R. has snatched her
up. I have a new appreciation for Indian culture. Those people know how
to have a good time. The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. The only problem I had was deciphering some of the British slang and
dialogue through the accents. I turned on the English subtitles to make
sure I didn't miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the film!) I'm
sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly
changing slang in American films as well. This is a perfect date film. It has a great sports plot like Rocky, and
a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women. I watched it
with my wife, and sixteen year old niece, and we all loved it. I highly
recommend it.",112,2002

keeps the comic tone and a droll vibe going. Kate Hudson looks pretty

movement in Britain in the early 20th century. Carry Mulligan plays
Maud Watts...a woman who slowly comes into the movement and the
sacrifices she personally made as a result.I noticed that a few of the reviews on IMDb hated the film and by the
way they worded the reviews, they seemed upset that women earned the
right to vote or thought women never had fight to achieve this!!
Strange...very strange. Women DID have to fight and fight hard to earn
their rights and the film does a very nice job of it. Why anyone would
give the film a 1 or see it as some lie is just baffling...and ignorant
of British history. The fictionalized life of Carry Mulligan's is
essentially true of many women and the horrific event concerning Emily
Davison DID occur in 1913....so why hate that the film dramatizes this?Overall, the film is extremely compelling and very emotional to watch.
Seeing women abused and mistreated is tough....and should grab your
heart. Well acted and worth seeing. My only complaint is ts are that
the film, at times, is a bit sterile...which is odd considering the
events. And, it uses a modern device I hate--the roving camera (hold
that camera still #@&@#%^...it's NOT arsty to have bad camera

1645,11.2,6.4,"Clint Eastwood's 20th feature directed and starring himself, Blood
Work, is a good sign in times of recent thriller drek. Here is Clint,
72 years old, and actually doing the right thing; being the old sort of
Dirty Harry-esquire type of cop while still being realistic with
himself. Truth be told, he won't do movies forever, much less be a cop
with almost all the right moves, and here we see him as FBI Agent Terry
McCaleb in the beginning try and climb a fence to catch a code killer
(which resonates from past Eastwood projects) and he collapses from a
heart attack (sad but oddly accurate). He retires, and two years later
a woman comes forth to him asking for help in finding a killer. And anyway, what makes Blood Work so fascinating (if only up to a point
if seen more than once) is that it's a well crafted thriller, one that
has the usual police procedural from many years back, a bit of a
romance with Wanda DeJesus, and comic relief from Jeff Daniels. So, if
you decide to see this latest installment in the sprawling career of
Clint Eastwood, keep in mind that it has all the style, music, and
nostalgia even in donuts that it had back in the day 30 years ago. And
maybe it's just me, but it will be hard not to grin when you see him

little surprised. The plot and CGI were good. The acting and casting
was excellent. Some parts of the movie felt really similar to The
Exorcist II (Boorman), and I appreciated the lucidity and metaphysics
embedded in the plot. I felt like the scene changes and juxtaposing
modern/mythical images did a good job of sliding the viewer into the
otherworldliness of the script. Most of the criticism seemed to revolve
around expectations of Vin Diesels performance. The Character is
written tersely for a reason. Why do people expect someone to be
Shakespeare, simply because they lived 800 years. That experience might
make some people very quiet, and I found Vin Diesel's interpretation
believable and appropriate. He isn't portrayed as a scholar or wizard:
just a good man who happens to be cursed. Frankly, I don't think most
of these people would have been happy with a 20 min monologue by Alan

1648,10.6,6.8,"This movie isn't the best Western ever made, but it's a solid creative
effort that brings out many of that genre's most appealing aspects. It has
romance, gunplay, wonderful scenery, and, most importantly, a solid hero and
a solid villain. Westerns are, by nature, a morality tale. There's a Good
Guy and a Bad Guy, and in the end, the hero prevails through a combination
of courage, fair play, and ingenuity. And that's exactly what happens here.The three principal characters are Quigley, an American sharpshooter hired
by an Australian rancher, Marsden, and Crazy Cora, a woman shipped off to
Australia by her ex-husband after accidentally suffocating her baby to keep
him quiet while hiding from raiding Comanches. Quigley (Tom Selleck) is an
expert long range marksman who has been recruited ostensibly to shoot
dingoes, but, as he finds out after his first night with Mr. Marsden (Alan
Rickman), his real targets are to be local Aboriginies. This leads to a
rather violent falling out between the two men, which sets up the basic
conflict in the movie. Marsden wants Quigley dead, and has numerous
ranchhands to get the job done. Quigley has the shooting skills that allow
him to pick off Marden's men pretty much at will. An uncredited ""star"" of
the film is Quigley's Sharp's .45 calibre rifle, a gun so accurate it can
kill a man from nearly a mile away. Anyway, the movie proceeds in a more or less conventional fashion. After a
big fistfight at Marsden's ranchhouse, Quigley and Cora are left for dead in
the Australian outback. They are rescued by a band of Aboriginies, then
quickly return the favor by picking off Marsden's men as they try to
massacre more Aboriginies. Along the way, Quigley slowly falls for Cora. She
may be nuts, but she's also charming, resourceful, brave, and beautiful.In the end, Marsden gets what he deserves. Cora regains her sanity. And
Quigley gets both the villain and the girl. Like I said, it's a Western in
the classic tradition - well told and with great visuals.8/10",119,1990
1649,6.75,6.8,"DC had the best animated films. Especially the Batman stuff but now..
we get pure garbage. After Flashpoint Paradox (which is one of the best
DCU films), it has just been going downhill and not stopping. There was
a little bit of hope with Batman Vs Robin and even the animated Suicide
Squad movie but after watching this trash.. after watching Batman Bad
Blood, I am officially giving up on all upcoming DC animated films.
They can wait for Cartoon Network for all I care.I guess my main issue is Batwoman. She takes up the majority of this
film and makes it nearly unwatchable. The people marketing this lame
piece of trash knew they couldn't call the movie ""Bat-woman: Bad Blood""
because no one would buy it. Batwoman is a painfully one dimensional
character and boring as all heck. She is just upset off all the time and seems to only care about
herself. In the beginning of the film her lack of training nearly gets
Batman killed and thought dead by everyone. When discussing Batman's
death, she doesn't seem to care much. On top of that, this stupid movie
forces us to watch Batwoman's dating life and her relationship with her
father and other things unrelated to the plot whatsoever. And we get to
she her lame origin story and it is laughably awful.Basically, she walks home drunk from a nightclub and almost gets jumped
by a few guys but is saved by Batman. After she doesn't thank Batman
for saving her, she sees the Bat Symbol in the sky and gets inspired. I
wish I was making this up. The last thing I have to call BS on about
Batwoman is her fight at the end of the movie with Talia Al Ghul. She
goes toe to toe with Talia Al Ghul without missing a beat. Normally, I
would have no problem with this but at the beginning of the film we
literally see Batwoman having trouble with C-list villains. So I guess
that must make Talia Al Ghul, one of Batman's deadliest villains a
C-List enemy. Man I hate this movie.I guess I should actually review this piece of trash, given the fact I
wasted my time watching it but I just wanted to give you a little
introduction about my history with DC's animated film universe. Anyway,
it is hard to pick just one thing that makes this film hard to watch. This review is getting too long and honestly there is a ton of things
to complain about. The pacing of the movie just terrible. The action is
okay but the storyline makes you not really give a care. One last thing, PLEASE STOP GIVING BATMAN A GUN!!! What the heck is

their daily struggle for survival in a class-ridden society, only this time
it's the Great Depression in the Welsh valleys. They face temptations, peer
hostility if they do not conform to the norm, and total frustration (though
in this case alleviated by a seaside visit to Blackpool, that epitome of

acting, a clear, concise story of characters making poor choices -
leading to predictable consequences.But who cares? There's no entertainment here! None of these characters
are worth giving a damn about, and the few sporadic scenes that offer
any true value sit like islands on a still horizonless sea.But I learned something... Really? This might be the number one reason
to sit through this boring expanse, and the info is not worth it. The
scumbags are scumbags, the protagonist is a weak, shallow excuse for a
law enforcer, and the other surrounding characters are bland at best

an already white bread affair). Speaking of white bread - No culture

most sophisticated special effects yet seen in a movie. The film
tackles some dark themes such as death and falling in and out of love.
The characters themselves are on the face of it unsympathetic. Elvira

film works well as a comedy because of the quick and clever dialogue

1657,4.0,6.2,"More than twenty years before Peter Jackson's visionary adaptation of
The Lord Of The Rings, there was this 1978 animated effort from
director Ralph Bakshi. An ambitious and reasonably faithful version of
the story, this has sadly been rather over-shadowed by the Jackson
trilogy. Indeed, many reviewers here on the IMDb (mainly those who saw
the newer version first) seem to be fiercely unkind to this version....
but if one applies a little common sense, and takes into consideration
the time when it was made and the technical possibilities that existed
at that time, then they will realise that this is a pretty good film.
Indeed, it was shortly after seeing this animated movie back in the
early '80s that I sought out Tolkien's book and immediately became a
lifelong fan of these richly detailed Middle Earth adventures. So, in
some respects, I owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film
which shaped my literary tastes forever.Sauron, the Dark Lord of Middle Earth, forges an all-powerful ring that
gives him incredible power. Following a great battle during which
Sauron is defeated, the ring falls into possession of a king named
Isildur. but instead of destroying it he foolishly chooses to keep it.
For centuries the ring passes from hand to hand, eventually coming into
the possession of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins who lives in a
peace-loving community known as The Shire. Frodo learns from a wizard
named Gandalf that his ring is in fact The One Ring, the very same that
was forged by Sauron all those centuries ago, and that its master is
once again searching for it in order to restore his dark power over the
entire land. Frodo embarks on a perilous journey to protect the ring
with three other hobbit companions, but every step of the way they are
hunted by Sauron's ring-wraiths, the Black Riders. There follow many
adventures, during which a company of nine adventurers is formed to
guide the ring to the only place where it can be ""unmade""  Mount Doom,
in the land of Mordor. The film concludes with Frodo and his best
friend Sam on the borders of Mordor, closing ever nearer to their
horrifying destination. Meanwhile Gandalf and the other members of the
company fight off a huge army of orcs at the legendary fortress of
Helm's Deep.This version covers just over half of the original book. A second
instalment was planned to bring the story to an end, but was sadly
never completed. While the ending feels abrupt, it does at least end at
a sensible point in the story. One has to feel a little frustration and
regret that no sequel exists in which we might follow these animated
heroes to their eventual goal. The animation is passable, with a nice
variety of locales and characters presented in interesting detail. The
music by Leonard Rosenman is suitably stirring and fits in
appropriately with the epic narrative. The voice-overs are decent, too,
especially John Hurt as Aragorn and Peter Woodthorpe as Gollum. On the
other hand, Michael Scholes - who provides the voice for Sam - is
rather campy and goofy, which is not well suited to the character. The
Lord Of The Rings is a commendable attempt to visualise the staggering
book on which it is based.",132,1978
1658,10.0,4.7,"I love films that are seriously different. This film is exactly that.
Why? Almost all film and TV drama portrays its' characters behaving as
humans do, one way or the other, in all sorts of scenarios. Even
animation (Shreck, Monster inc) and animal (eg ""talking dog genre"",
Babe, Nemo etc) movies depict the characters behaving in ways
consistent with modern humans. You as watcher can easily relate to the
characters even if in violent or extreme scenarios.Not so Aaaaaaaah !.In this exceptional film the writer and director have made an attempt
to change the depiction of personal, social and sexual behavior to fit
a conjecture that humans could have carried full blown ape behavior and
mores with them all the way from the jungle to modern post-industrial
society.On that level the film is riveting and a challenge to the cast of
professional actors who did pretty well with it. However, on a serious
downside. I found myself constantly battling with an endless need to
suspend and re-suspend disbelief. It was really difficult to have an
immersive experience with the film. You may argue it is not necessarily
a bad thing to be forced to cerebrally multitask. but Fantasy and/or
Sci-fi works well if it is consistent within itself. Suspension of
disbelief is best achieved as a brief hypnotic act and you are in. This
film constantly bothered me with its inconsistencies. Examples.. it
places non-verbal grunting apes as the equals of our modern humans with
exact achievements in science, architecture, technology and so on.
Clearly absurd. Intellectual achievement require an extraordinarily
complex language structure. All things need to be named and defined.
Language is an essential prerequisite for thought. Grunting apes cannot
achieve the results. A flat panel TV and iPad have advanced physics
behind their creation. You can't grunt your way to an iPad. Also.. the
human/apes in this film behaved in ways which were
messy/anarchistic/destructive in the extreme. So why were they clothed
in such immaculate clothing, and why was the film set in such an
over-clean, over-ordered environment where absolutely nothing was out
of place. The physical structure of the city environment, street
cleanliness and manicure park lands shouted ""INCONSISTENCY"". And where
were the forces of control (police etc) which would need to be present
and dominant in a society with such rampantly anarchistic behavior.And furthermore there were absurd, unnecessary .. school-boy-humour
jokes injected into the film (eg a store manager masturbating all over
a framed photo of Prince Harry) with no reason plot-wise .. doing
nothing but challenging the integrity of the film.I think many viewers will abandon the film as ""this is too silly"".
However, for me it was a fascinating and rewarding experience.

incredibly!! Definitely a 10 out of 10!",0,1992
1660,4.5,7.1,"Say what you want about America but money is a very big part of our
society. It's a free-for-all pursuit of money and it so helps with
having a good family background. If you can't afford college to get
your degree or don't have a career after high school, you are on your
own. It's like high school all over where you have to find yourself
again.99 Homes has many themes pertinent to today's society. From the idea of
money and how to handle your money and also the banking system, it's an
accurate image of our society today. Who knows how it will hold up
twenty years down the road due to how society is going to change but
for now 99 Home knows exactly what's going in the world now and tells
it's story in a very original way.Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) is an unemployed construction worker who
gets evicted along with his family from his home by businessman and
con-man Rick Carver (Michael Shannon). As a way of getting his
childhood home back, Dennis joins Rick's business team not knowing what
lies ahead for him.As most kids after high school, I didn't have a plan for myself and
college was my only option. I was lucky enough to get a good job at a
grocery store that will be able to support me though college. Even
though I had my differences with my hometown, growing up in one of the
richest towns in Michigan had it's perks also. It's so hard and
heartbreaking to watch Dennis not have money or a name to himself. He
must support his mother Lynn (Laura Dern) and his son Conner (Noah
Lomax) through only construction jobs. Then you have someone like
Carver who's at the different end of the spectrum and doing everything
right for himself but he is someone who makes his big dough from
forcing people out of their own homes and in the wrong way. As we
expect, Michael Shannon, always plays a determined and powerful
character and he is able to captivate every character that he plays.
That said, Andrew Garfield's performance is even more impressive. He is
able to express through emotions the things his character is dealing
with and he takes you on a ride with him. He plays a character who does
not know how to save his family and who is wondering if the scheme he
is involved in is the right thing to do. His morals and values are
being severely tested.Another example of the money ideas at play here is the setting. The
movie is set in Orlando, Florida, with some of the biggest houses on
the street sitting next to the smallest houses where the evictions
happen. It is such an accurate image again of how different the concept
""money"" is for everyone. Some people are set for life where others are
living paycheck to paycheck. This film seems to know both sides of that
so well.99 Homes is a film that the main topic is eviction and really this
should have been dull ride. How this film is able make this topic
interesting and thought-provoking is very impressive. 99 Homes is so
off the map on this topic but in a good way.99 Homes is a character study with Oscar quality performances
especially from Garfield. It is also societal story and commentary, a
story of determination and one of the top films of the year all rolled
in one. There are literally are 99 reasons to go see this movie.",112,2014

of the film, with Laura meeting smooth talking Treat Williams (who
comes dressed like the James Dean poster on Dern's wall) is elongated
and dry (you can almost feel the director's confidence slipping away).
It's an encounter I didn't particularly care for, nor did I buy the
rosy ending either. However, there are fine moments in ""Smooth Talk"",
the most devastating of which lies in a conversation between Dern and
indifferent sis Elizabeth Berridge (in a terrific performance): Dern

everything but lacking some important aspects like living sober and
teamwork. Though they come up with this great idea they practically
manages to screw everything up within months by not knowing decent
business ethics and keeping up the promises to the partners. This is
where Jack Harris comes in who is a legit business man and a problem
solver who turns the already million dollar porn business in to new
heights by creating a middle party online billing concept. These 3
people who ultimately become victims of their own success, and digs
deep in to unknown territory getting involved with very dangerous
people.The story telling is quite catchy in 'Middle Men'. It's fast phased and
cannot be backtracked if you miss a line yet gives mood to the whole
plot. It starts from the end and finishes from the end. The middle is
the beginning! Buck and Wayne played by Gabriel Macht and Giovanni
Ribisi respectively are two unique characters. They practically create
the cash and demolish everything skillfully. Jack on the other hand
played by Luke Wilson is an intelligent businessman who stops at
nothing when he wants to achieve something. The whole plot is a
struggle between these 3 people who just fails to find common ground
even though they keep on earning millions of money by doing the same
thing.There is a kind of rush throughout the movie. This is created strongly
using sex and money hand in hand with crime and desire. You will feel
like each of these people are time bombs which is about to blow up
eventually. Yet they exist like they will live forever. Except Jack who
does a very smart move by creating an opportunity of out a grave
danger.A good load of entertainment and some background info on how internet

usually tell what was coming, but I was still shocked when it actually
happened. I'm usually pretty conservative when it comes to movies, but the
American Pie movies have been two of my favorite movies ever. The second
movie takes over at the end of the first year of college. The first scene
can be figured out by seeing the previews, but there were still a lot of
surprises in the movies.There are a lot of great scenes at Stifler's party, and I was surprised to
see that not only were the main characters back, but most of the supporting
characters were back as well (remember the two guys from the M.I.L.F.

1668,10.0,7.6,"There are combinations of film makers that make you confident, as you
pay your ticket price, that you are not going to be terribly
disappointed: Steven Spielberg directing; Tom Hanks taking the lead;
Janusz Kaminski behind the camera; Michael Kahn editing and a Coen
brothers script (with Matt Charmon (Suite Française)). And Bridge of
Spies doesn't disappoint, particularly for someone of my more advanced
years (I was born the year following the film's climatic events) who
remembers well the terror of potential nuclear catastrophe that hung
over the world through the 60's and 70's.In a story based on true events, Hanks plays James Donovan (diverging
somewhat from reality here) as an insurance lawyer dragged by his firm
into defending Rudolf Abel, the accused Soviet spy played exquisitely
by British stage acting legend Mark Rylance. Against this backdrop, the
international blue touch paper is about to be lit by the shooting down
over Russia of Gary Powers (Austin Stowell from ""Whiplash"") in his U-2
spy plane (sorry  ""article""). Donovan becomes instrumental in
unofficially negotiating on behalf of the US government the release of
Powers in East Berlin. The deal is jeopardized by his boy-scout
tendencies to also want to help another US captive Frederic Pryor (Will
Rogers).I've read some negative reviews of this film in the papers that made me
quite cross, describing it as ""yawnsome"" and ""sanctimoniously dull"".
For me, nothing could be further from the truth and the packed Saturday
night audience I saw this with seemed equally gripped from beginning to
end, silent save for the odd laugh where some appropriate humor is
weaved into the story.Tom Hanks is solid and believable as the fish-out-of-water lawyer,
albeit that the role is played with a large spoonful of patriotic
American sugar as Donovan trumpets about the importance of the
constitution over the lynch-mob mentality of the general public. Alan
Alda  great to see again on the big screen  channels his best
Hawkeye-style exasperation as Donovan's boss, looking for a clean and
quick conviction.But it is Mark Rylance  an irregular player in movies, and due to
appear again in next year's ""BFG""  who shines out as the acting star
of the film. His salubrious and calm turn as the cornered spy just
reeks of class and if he isn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor
nomination for this then there is no justice. (A special 'casting
recognition award' to my wife Sue for spotting that the actress playing
Judge Byer's wife  Le Clanché du Rand  was Meg Ryan's mother in
Sleepless in Seattle 22 years ago!) The cinematography is superb with some gorgeous tracking shots and
framed scenes. Most outstanding of all is the scene depicting the
traumatic construction of the Berlin wall  long tracking shots in
greys and blues delivering a truly breathtaking piece of cinema. In
general I'd give a big shout-out to both the art department and the
special effects team in making the desolation of East Berlin feel so
real. It makes the similar scenes, that I commented positively on in
the recent ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" seem like an amateur school
production.The special effects team also contribute in making the shooting down of
the U-2 a thrilling piece of cinema.Music is sparingly and effectively used by Thomas Newman, and it can be
no greater complement to the composer than that I was wondering until
the end titles as to whether it was another Spielberg/ John Williams
collaboration or not.A great film, one of my favorites this year. Highly recommended,
especially if you are over 50. You should also get out to a cinema to
see this one  it will be far more effective on the big screen than the
small one.(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of

1676,8.4,6.9,"Tradition be damned! I HATED the Mary Martin, Sandy Duncan, Cathy Rigby
productions of Peter Pan! There, I've said it. I realize I'm in the
minority on this point, but I have NEVER been able to accept the idea
of some actress dressing up in silly green tights, singing equally
silly songs, while pretending to be a prepubescent boy pretending to
fly on silly piano wires. I fully admit that it's a pet peeve of mine
and not meant to denigrate those who have delighted in this tradition.
As a long time lover of the J.M. Barrie stories and play, all I can say
is that P.J. Hogan's ""Peter Pan"" is the Pan movie I have waited my
entire life for. It is simply a glorious retelling of the J.M. Barrie
tale. After Spielberg's dreadful 1991 abortion, ""Hook"" I was convinced
that the story had been buried forever as far as big budget film-making
was concerned. I thought all there would be was the 1953 Disney
animated film, which unfortunately is more Disney than Barrie or worse,
that I was condemned to a lifetime of endless reruns of Mary Martin and
Cyril Ritchard. Boy, was I wrong. Taking its visual cue from the
wondrous illustrations of Maxfield Parrish, Edmund Dulac, N.C. Wyeth
and Arthur Rackham, this new film recreates the storybook Never Land on
a level that has never been achieved before, nor will ever be again.But the film is not simply a special-effects fest a la ""Star Wars"". The
effects, dazzling as they are, are just the icing on the cake. Hogan
understands it is the characters, and our need to care for them, that
must carry the film. And this film has a wonderful cast. Jeremy Sumpter
is a great Peter Pan. Gifted with a luminous smile and physicality, he
captures all the radiant cockiness, the self-delighted impishness of
undefeated, indefatigable youth. One almost feels sorry for Hook for
having such an adversary. Rachel Hurd-Wood in a very impressive film
debut does a marvelous job as Wendy, the young daughter of the Darlings
now at the beginning of young womanhood. Hurd-Wood is both child and
woman, and she and Sumpter have very warm and charming screen chemistry
in their scenes together, capturing the potentially dangerous
under-current of adolescent sensuality without ever hitting you over
the head with it, or becoming too cloy. Olivia Williams as Mrs. Darling
isn't given much to do, beyond being the mother everyone wishes they
had, but she does that very well, and she serves the story beautifully.
And she is absolutely gorgeous. In the double role of Mr.
Darling/Captain Hook, Jason Isaacs finally comes into his own as the
cinema's most perfidious villain since Basil Rathbone crossed swords
with Errol Flynn. Isaacs is simply magnificent in a role he was born to
play. With a sneer and a swash of his buckle he obliterates forever the
image of Hook as a buffoon, the mere butt of Peter's jokes. This is a
dangerous, deadly Hook, a figure of Satanic dignity, who one can
believe might actually best Peter some dark, unlucky night. Lynn
Redgrave plays the role of Aunt Millicent, a character created for the
film and not in any of the Peter Pan literature. While the new part
doesn't really add anything to the story, it doesn't really take
anything away either. And Redgrave is always a joy to watch. Finally
the performance of the great Richard Briers should be noted. As Smee he
steals every scene he is in. It is a delightful comic turn. The one performance I questioned was Ludivine Sagnier as Tinker Bell.
While I loved the concept of Tink as a bitch-sprite, capable of
murderous intent, I felt at times her performance was a little broad.
This may have been the outgrowth of having to play a purely physical
role without the benefit of any spoken lines. On the other hand I
thought she was vastly superior to Julia Roberts who played the same
role in ""Hook"". Nor was she a Marilyn Monroe wannabe from Disney.
Sagnier to her credit never plays the part for easy sentimentality. Hogan and company have brought the Barrie work to the screen and have
rightly restored to it a child's sense of awe and wonder, of both
beauty and terror co-existing side by side and for this reason alone it
is the definitive film version of Peter Pan",113,2003

comeuppance for the know-nothing lead character, which for some reason
I was expecting, like a punch line to a joke. The other thing that was
lacking that could have made the lead character more interesting and
likable was some personal growth. There is simply very little for the

1679,10.857142857142858,7.0,"Legend is a gripping movie, there's no doubt about it. Seeing Tom Hardy
on screen, whether he's playing Reggie, Ronald, or both, is absolutely
captivating. He owns the roles, and despite their identical looks you
feel that they're completely different people because of how well Hardy
portrays them. Reggie is sophisticated, methodical, affable; Ronnie is
impulsive, unpredictable, paranoid. As a vehicle for Tom Hardy's acting
chops, Legend is a home run. Unfortunately, that is where the positives
of the movie end.The movie is tonally confused from scene to scene. It can be romantic
one minute, ultra-violent the next, then reserved and introspective the
minute after that. It's clunky writing; every time the movie begins to
gain momentum it trips on itself one way or another. Also, you really
don't care about any character other than the twins. I mean, thankfully
they're in just about every scene, but they're always surrounded by
faceless goons, or with a generic love interest, or no-name cops - not
fully fleshed out characters. This is in no way a fault of the actors
though. Christopher Eccleston is wasted yet again as a villain after
Thor: The Dark World. Here he's in an antihero role as the cop assigned
to the Kray's case, but his lines lack any form of personality. He does
what he can but he really has nothing to work with. Chazz Palminteri
makes an appearance for about 5 minutes total as his usual gangster
self, but in the end you're left scratching your head. So many
characters, so much potential, but the only thing holding the movie
together is Tom Hardy.So as you can infer, Legend is worth a watch if you're a Tom Hardy fan.
He's scarily good in these roles, and two Tom Hardys are better than
one. For that reason alone I can't give this movie a lower score.

1684,15.0,6.5,"First of all, I haven't read the book. That means I can't compare it
with the movie, if anyone is interested in that. The story here is
quite interesting. The movie takes place about 20 years after World War
II, a war won by Germany. That means many differences from what really
happened:- All Europe is one single country, Germania (I think)- Germania is still at war with the Soviet Union- No one really knows about the extermination of the Jews. The official
story is that they were deported to Ukraine.- The celebration of Hitler's 75th birthday is soon about to take
place. The American President is going to make him a visit.This makes the background for what happens in this movie. A man is
found dead, and the investigator gets a mystery to solve that grows
bigger as he digs up information.The movie is quite good, just take into consideration that it's a bit
low budget. Remember, it's a TV-movie.(Something totally different: It was funny seeing a poster of ""The
Beatles"" called ""Die Beatles"").",106,1994
1685,4.5,7.6,"After filming stories about the resistance of the Italian people during
the Fascist and Nazi regimes, and the story of a German child against
the barren landscape of Berlin after the war, Roberto Rossellini made a
movie about Francis of Assisi and started a love and work relationship
with actress Ingrid Bergman. In his evolution to works like 'The Rise
To Power of Louis XIV', he made a series of melodramas with Bergman, of
which 'Stromboli' and 'Voyage To Italy' are always considered the most
important. Add to that list this fine drama, in which bourgeois
housewife Irene suffers a transformation when confronted with the
misery of those who had not been benefited with the European 'economic
miracle.' Considered a saint by those she helped (Giulietta Masina
included), Rossellini makes quite obvious that Irene reached that state
by detouring from the usual roads she took as the wife of a prominent
industrialist (Alexander Knox.) Not only has she a Marxist cousin who
curiously does not preach his philosophy, but gives Irene advise
whenever she talks about the misery she is discovering- but she also
ventures into the slums, helps a single mother, a prostitute and a
thief. The final section of the movie reminded me of 'María de mi
corazón', a latter film written by Gabriel García Márquez, based on a
real story. As in 'María' there is neither opportunity nor chance to
explain clearly what she's going through to husband or authorities,
leading her to a dead end of desperation. Only sainthood will save her
from the dehumanization around her.",118,1952

story so you wind up with an unnecessary short that just serves as a
reminder that there was this movie a couple of years ago that had these
characters people liked. I mean the whole thing is basically one song
stretched over a thin plot about a birthday party for Anna. That's it.
It doesn't feel like they had this amazing idea for a short in mind but
that they just wanted to keep the Frozen brand alive while they worked
on a feature-length sequel. Maybe I'm wrong about the motivation but
the whole thing just seems pointless beyond the commercial reasons.

it really makes you appreciate the animated theatrical shorts from
decades ago when people put effort into crafting a quality cartoon with

1687,10.333333333333334,7.0,"Although a lot of this plot is taken from the Richard Widmark rodeo
film When the Legends Die, The Color of Money is still a worthy film
and a good successor to the early Paul Newman classic, The Hustler.I imagine that players like Paul Newman who create classic characters
like Fast Eddie Felson must be bombarded with scripts or story ideas
for sequels. Paul Newman is one of the most discriminating of players
and up to this point he had only reprised his role in Harper with The
Drowning Pool.When he decided to do The Color of Money there was no need to age
Newman twenty five years with makeup. Time had done a better job than
any makeup man could have done. Time had also honed his acting
abilities so that he could realistically recreate one of his classic
characters in an older generation.One thing about The Color of Money is that can and does stand
independently of The Hustler. You do not have to have seen the earlier
film to know what's happening here. Nevertheless in that earlier film,
promising new pool player Eddie Felson does not take direction from
mobsters who effectively end his career before he gets it firmly on
track.Fast forward from 1961 to 1986 and Paul Newman is now a liquor salesman
who hangs around poolrooms in tank towns and dreams what might have
been. A young kid with a 'sledgehammer break' gets Newman's attention
and its Tom Cruise. He's got a girlfriend, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio
with him and the three sort of adopt each other. It's a complicated relationship between all three of them and all three
of them manage to convey the many ups and downs of this triangle.
Newman teaches Cruise the tricks of the trade including how to tank a
game occasionally to bring up the betting odds. In many ways Cruise
learns too well and Newman hanging around with him makes him realize
just how much he's missed because of the gangland blackball.Reportedly Newman and Cruise got along splendidly during the making of
The Color of Money. Their joint interest in auto racing cemented a very
good working relationship.Paul Newman was also nominated during the eighties for Absence of
Malice and The Verdict which are two of my favorites with him.
Unfortunately in the first he was up against Henry Fonda who had been
similarly snubbed for years by the Academy and was dying during the
Oscar voting. The second time Ben Kingsley portrayal of the title role
in the massive blockbuster Gandhi obscured what I think is Newman's
finest performance in The Verdict.Though the Oscar was an Oscar for lifetime of work, The Color of Money
is a worthy sequel to The Hustler. Martin Scorsese got great
performances out of the whole cast. And Paul Newman finally got a
matching Oscar to go with the one Joanne Woodward won for The Three
Faces of Eve for their mantelpiece.",119,1986

1692,4.333333333333333,6.0,"Potentially this could have been the most interesting work from Anton
Corbijn, as he is himself a well-known portrait photographer. The story
is about Magnum photographer Dennis Stock (Pattison) convincing a
reluctant upcoming James Dean (DeHaan) to follow him to make a series
of portraits. As you might know, Magnum set new standards in
photography and Stock in his famous series contributed to a completely
different view on portrait photography of stars: natural setting,
confrontational, honest and direct.During the movie, a bond grows between the two, as Dean turns out to be
an atypical Hollywood star ignoring the rules set out by his superiors
resulting in several confrontations. Stock largely ignores his duties
to his former wife and their child and becomes obsessed by Dean's
idiosyncrasy. The second part is the most interesting as it almost
deconstructs Dean's life and character: Dean comes from a farmland
family of Quakers, likes local poets and is fond of his background and
actually despises stardom. Stock is first able to shoot pictures in New
York (you probably know the famous photograph) and in Indiana.So what are the downsides: the pacing is too slow, the editing
certainly not perfect and the most important trap: Corbijn as
photographer is too much in love with the story, finding details
relevant that are actually not that relevant. The question keeps
popping up: Why does this matter? Life fails in a way as a mood piece,
but is still a relatively good and stable character drama as the
deconstruction works well.Maybe both Pattison and DeHaan are too light to pull this off more
convincing, but one role is certainly amazing: Ben Kingsley as Jack
Warner is so spot-on you will be remembering the character despite the
limited screen time.",111,2015

1694,4.333333333333333,3.7,"Hercules directed and written by Luigi Cozzi stars the great Lou
Ferrigno as the title character and takes great liberties with his
story. It's aimed squarely at kids, with its colorful characters and
even more colorful special effects. What i liked about it was the
steady pacing, the absolutely weird musical cues and Lou's solid, if
perhaps too straight performance.Forget all you know about Herc, this film stands on its own. Some of
the old tale is here, baby Herc does crush snakes sent by his
stepmother Hera and he does grow up peacefully not knowing why he's so
strong. An early battle with a giant bear is well-shot. Lou certainly
looks the part, unlike some other actors who tried and he isn't that
bad with the dialog, which is very ripe. In this version Herc's great love is Casseopeia, played by the very
easy to look at Ingrid Andersson. I so wanted to get that veil off her
face! Herc must win her hand by competing in a series of bizarre rites
of Strong. Including the classic cleaning of the stables. Which is a
great sequence using miniatures and super-imposition. Even the rocks
look heavy and real for a change! Still Zeus, and at least one actor,
Claudio Casselinni, was understated, wants the sides of good and evil
to be balanced, so Herc and Cass are separated.Not to fear, Herc soon hooks up with sorceress Circe, played by another
beauty in a barely there outfit. She aid him in his celestial quest to
conquer the evil of Thera and save Cass from being a virgin(!)
sacrifice! The set for Thera, the green isle of Atlantis actually, is one of the
best I've seen outside of Star Wars: Episode IV, its truly a great work
of lighting and miniature sets, complete with a flame-wielding
colossus. Herc's great strength is no match for the witch Adriana
(called Ariana in my version,) played by the buxom Sybil Danning, but
his great heart is, he's loyal to Cass. This all leads to a duel with
the evil King Minos, who wants science to rule the world at the expense
of all emotion. Their duel with Herc wielding the sword of Zeus and
Minos the fire sword of Atlantis is great. The finale is spectacular
and I love Herc's ending line to the rescued Cass. and check her final
outfit, wow! ""How do I know you're really Casseopeia? Or are you
Adriana is another form or Circe reborn?"" She responds ""I am all and
none of them. I am the one who loves you!""Cool movie, what I didn't like was the cheesy robots, they simply
looked bad! Also why was Daedelus, the God who helps Minos, played by a
woman? Some elements of the plot were confusing. Still this a great
family adventure, the hero is great the girls are lovely and there is
nothing objectionable save some light violence. If you're looking for a

1699,7.25,7.1,"The famous and invaluable diamond known as the Pink Panther is stolen once
again from the museum in Lugash, and the authorities decide immediately that
to effect the return of this National Treasure they must seek the help of
the one man they know will bring the needed expertise to the case:
Clouseau. And so it is that `The Return Of The Pink Panther' is entrusted
to none other than the inimitable Inspector (Peter Sellers) from France,
much to the chagrin of Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who, knowing
what unbridled mayhem Clouseau is really capable of, would like nothing more
than to be rid of him once and for all. But such a request from the
sovereign authorities of a friendly nation cannot be denied, and Clouseau is
therefore dispatched with all haste to Lugash, with orders to bring the
criminals to justice, and insure that the case is indeed-- to quote
Clouseau-- `solv-ed.'
Some ten years had passed since director Blake Edwards and Sellers had
teamed up for the brilliant film `A Shot In The Dark,' before coming
together once again for this third installment chronicling the misadventures
of the `belov-ed' Inspector Clouseau. But the wait was certainly worth it.
Cleverly written and delivered, it affords Sellers ample opportunities to do
what he does best: Make you laugh. Whether affecting an alias in disguise
or forthrightly confronting the usual suspects, Clouseau deftly uncovers
every `ploy' attempted by the unscrupulous thieves he seeks. There are
moments so hilarious that even co-star Catherine Schell (Claudine) has
trouble keeping a straight face at times; but rather than being a
distraction (as you'd think it would be), it somehow makes it even funnier.
And it's a great example of why this movie is so good, and why it works so
well. Simply put, it's fun. Edwards has a formula for success that begins
with having a good story at the core, an excellent supporting cast to flesh
it all out, then mixing it all together with the main ingredient which is,
of course, Sellers. It's one that works, and of which directors of some of
the more recent fare being proffered as `comedy' could
benefit.
Christopher Plummer is well cast as debonair master thief Sir Charles
Litton, bringing an air of sophistication to the film that contrasts so well
with the antics of Sellers. Characters returning after debuting in `A Shot
In The Dark' include the terrific Lom, whose Chief Inspector Dreyfus is the
perfect foil for Clouseau; Andre Maranne (Francois); and of course Burt
Kwouk as Clouseau's ever-attacking manservant, Cato. The scenes between
Sellers and Kwouk, in which they spar at Clouseau's house, are a riot, as is
the way Sellers and Lom play off of one another throughout the film (or the
series, for that matter); Lom's `reactions' alone to what Sellers is doing
are classic bits of comedy.
Rounding out the supporting cast are Peter Arne (Colonel Sharky), Peter
Jeffrey (General Wadafi), Gregoire Aslan (Chief of Lugash Police), Victor
Spinetti (Hotel Concierge) and John Bluthal (Blind Beggar). A number of
elements go into making a comedy work, and `The Return Of The Pink Panther'
has them all, but most especially, Peter Sellers, who without a doubt is one
of the funniest actors ever to grace the silver screen. His comedy works
because he always plays it straight and allows the humor to flow naturally
from the situation at hand; there's never a laugh that is forced or false.
Consider one of the opening scenes in which Clouseau, walking a beat,
questions a blind beggar with a monkey about having the proper permits to
beg, all while the bank in front of which they are standing is being robbed.
There's a purity about it that makes it a joy to watch; the kind of film
you can see over and over again and never get tired of. One of the great
things about video and DVD is that it affords us the opportunity of cuing up
this film-- as well as the other `Panther' movies-- at will. For a lot of
laughs, take advantage of the technology at hand and check out Peter Sellers
and discover what `classic' comedy is all about. It never gets old, and
somehow just keeps getting better with age. I rate this one 9/10. ",113,1975

movie firmly etched in your head, head out to the theater. But NOT

Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff himself), is a ton of great, naughty fun. It
wonderfully sends up B-movie sci-fi/horror flicks, with a playful, healthy
dose of blatant sexual innuendo thrown in for good measure. Classic,

1706,5.666666666666667,5.4,"Eli Roth is a director whose fame certainly goes before him. These days
you don't really get many directors unashamedly dedicated to the horror
genre like you did in years gone by. I like Eli Roth for this reason
and I do find him a somewhat engaging, funny and entertaining guy. On
the flip side I would have to say that I have found his output to be
somewhat patchy and uneven. And frustratingly sparse at that. The Green
Inferno is his first feature film as director since Hostel: Part II
from way back in 2007! It's a long time to be out of the game. The
question would have to be has he came back in a good way? Well, despite
the undoubted promise of the central idea, it's a film that is kind of
as frustrating as most of his other work.The basic idea here is to bring back a type of movie that only really
existed briefly over thirty years ago. The cannibal film was a
particularly notorious sub-genre. Most of the films got banned here in
the UK; some still remain so to this day in their uncut forms. Their
combination of graphic violence, sexual assault and real animal killing
made them real bad boys of the horror genre. Cannibal Holocaust (1980)
is the one film that Roth has mentioned in particular as an influence
and for this viewer it is easily one of the most disturbing films I
have ever seen. Its docudrama, found footage style mixed with a proper
mean-spiritedness made it a pretty gruelling film but very well made.
The Green Inferno takes a decidedly different approach to its material
and it's not always a successful one. Where Holocaust was relentlessly
confrontational, Roth's film is often quite jokey. This approach means
that the tone overall fluctuates wildly but it definitely dissipates
the overall threat posed by the cannibals. The choice of protagonists
points to the change immediately in that it centres on a group of eco
aware students who travel into the middle of the Amazonian rain-forest
to stage a viral protest against some environment destroying workers,
needless to say things take a bad turn and they wind up captive by a
tribe of cannibals. The very fact that the film centres on a group of
students makes this film surely the first cannibal film that doubles up
as a teen movie! It's an awkward combination with a pretty ropey script
and  the main girl played by Lorenzo Izzo aside - unlikable
characters. The social commentary is not so unexpected for this type of
movie, as Cannibal Holocaust had that too but it is modernised
considerably here  the target is after all viral warriors who are more
interested in being famous than for doing the right thing.So how does it work simply as a horror movie? Well, it certainly has
its fair share of gory violence. But it has less impact than it should
because of the silly jokey tone that permeates it, even once the
students have been captured. Because they aren't taking their situation
seriously enough, it's hard for us in the audience to either
unfortunately. The on-location photography certainly adds a fair bit it
has to be said and the cannibals themselves are quite distinctive too,
in particular the more prominent members of the tribe were somewhat
creepy. I can't help feeling though that if Roth had reigned in the
silly stuff and went full-on with this material with a more disciplined
approach then it would have made for a far better film. It feels
slightly like a missed opportunity and I am sad to say this as I was
really on this one's side and had quite a bit of optimism for it.",100,2013

unknown with the heart of gold, a unique and virtuosic talent, from a
downtrodden and hopeless setting, the brooding and unsupportive parent
who refuses to accept his child's potential, the doting grandparent who
can see the potential that lies within our hero, the outsider who
promises a way to fame and fortune and so on... But, like the first few
""Rocky"" movies, this one delivers without falling into the usual
schmaltzy pitfalls.Kuno Becker is very well cast as promising young player Santiago Munez.
He is earnest, honest, and gives off that glow of burning desire to be
the best. My only knock is that he doesn't quite physically look the
part at times. When they line him up with real professionals he looks a
touch slight and skinny, not quite boasting the musleclature of a
professional athlete. The supporting cast works out well, too. No real
complaints to offer as everyone seems to be a very good fit. Alessandro
Nivola's dialect could use a spot of work, but no one outside of the UK
will really pick up on this. I very much liked Marcel Irues as
Newcastle United's Manager. He seemed to be a totally natural fit for
the role and is a shoe in for the lead if someone ever decides to make
the ""Aime Jacquet story"".Where this movie really takes off is on the pitch, whether its a park
in LA, the training ground in Newcastle, or St. James Park, the home of
Newcastle United. The soccer scenes are exceptionally well done and
look realistic. Real players feature prominently all over film, both on
and off the pitch, and not just in walk on cameos, ie ""Bend it like
Beckham"". The action is convincing, the tackles are crunching, and the
goals are authentic and not the usual over the top spectacle (anyone
remember Pele's winner from ""Victory""?) Becker fits in well with the
action scenes, though it's odd how you never really see all of Becker
on the ball and usually just the waist up, kind of like they found some
else to do all the little flicks and stepovers...And for all those who say ""it can't happen"", I beg to differ. This
movie is not fantasy. In fact, they could have made a biopic about a
young Calgarian from Western Canada who somehow manages to make Bayern
Munich, works his way up through the reserves, and in his premier
season with the senior side wins the league and European Cup, makes the
England side for World Cup 2002, and returns again to be the best
England player in World Cup 2006! Maybe someday someone out there will
make the ""Owen Hargreaves story"".All in all, great stuff and I'm already looking forward to Goal 2 & 3.",118,2005
1708,4.5,6.0,"We grow up. We change. And yet we often want our friends to stay the
same. Or better yet, to make up for how they may have hurt us a long
time ago. Sometimes we get that, sometimes we don't, and sometimes the
fiercest, most passionate friendships come to blows. 3 Days in the
Desert is a heartfelt story about those sorts of relationships, and how
we try to make them better, but maybe learn something about who we are
in the process. It's at times funny, but mostly appropriately sensitive
and rueful about a lost friendship that could be rekindled. The writing
is terrific, the cinematography is gorgeous and Wes Bentley and Amber
Tamblyn shimmer in their roles. Believable but also magnetic. The other
character, Barry, could have been softened in a lot of ways, but I find
it really interesting that he wasn't. Can we be generous to the person
whose dream changed along the way? Can we forgive the friend who broke
our heart? This movie gives you a lot to think about. Watch it and then

1709,10.0,5.7,"The American Civil War is by far the war that lasts forever in this
countries collective memory and was decreed in absentia by the flawed
original signing of the Declaration of Independence leaving slavery
intact. You would think that makes for great films and in many cases it
did,however rarely do they have mass appeal. This 2014 release that
sometimes seems longer then its 96 minutes,a flaw in pacing,is not
preachy yet stark in some of its depiction that may seem uneven at
times.Its based on a historic battle fought by cadets from VMI

a coming of age film and in that sense some might find it corny,I
didn't.The young actors were good but unknown to me.The ""b""level adult

1710,11.0,4.9,"The fuss in the media, and by word of mouth, led me to want to see this
film. I have always had a deep interest in censorship, be it of film,
music, art or any freedom of expression.I approached this film with the hope that it had been passed by the
censors because it had some kind of beautiful message or story to tell.
That the overall worth of the film had outweighed the controversy of
the sexual content and it was such a well made film that to deny it a
release would have been an injustice to film making.But I was deeply disappointed. If you take away the explicit content of
the film, it has nothing. It says nothing. It goes nowhere.It has no particular storyline or insight to offer, the sex scenes are
all it has to carry it. Without that it becomes nothing but a
collection of badly filmed concert footage. As for the musical artists
chosen, they are like the film..for twenty-somethings who think they
are being daring and are pushing the boundaries, but are walking the
safest path right down the middle of the road.The characters are not developed at all, and what you do see and learn
of them makes them instantly unlikable. Neither are they particularly
attractive- which makes the sexual content unpleasant to watch. It may
be (slightly) graphic but those people watching only for the hope of a
sexual thrill will also be very disappointed. I would much rather have seen this film without the graphic sexual
content, and a more satisfying storyline exploring the relationship
between the couple. As it is, it just lets you down in all areas. It is put forward as a unique insight into a couples love making, but
comes across as the cold, functional sex of a one night stand. There is
not the passion, or the intensity, of a genuine loving relationship.The film needed to be longer, to give time to develop the characters or
some kind of story and give the viewer something to grasp. The sixty
six minutes running time leaves you thinking ""is that it?"" and wanting
a refund- both of the money paid for the film and the hour of your life
you just wasted. It will remain notorious for its sexual content, and
continue to appeal to those who have not seen it. Once seen, it loses
any appeal.This film is most likely to end up being passed around schools by
thirteen year old boys and skipped to the sex scenes, or more likely
the sex scenes downloaded from a peer to peer network.I suppose the whole film does have one thing, an element of realism. It
is like watching a very expensively filmed home video but as everyone
knows other peoples lives may seem interesting at a distance, but close
up they are just as boring as your own.In this case, dull is an
understatement.Maybe that is the point..but if this film does have one, it is very
cleverly disguised.I really wanted to like this film. I really wanted it to be the ground
breaking, brave, work of artistic genius that the media promised.That
this was the film that would open the gates for a more honest era of
censorship.It isn't any of those things, the most interesting thing
about it is the question of how it was given a certificate..the biggest
question is why bother making it in the first place?",71,2004
1711,13.75,6.4,"I don't agree with the bad reviews here, I liked this movie very much.
The story keeps your attention focused up to the very end. I loved the
filming, the editing and the music. If you like a good old fashioned
thriller with surprising twists and an end that makes you think about
matters of life and death, this is a film to watch. It has just enough
body count, car chase and action to be all throughout interesting,
without overdoing violence.Anthony Hopkins' performance it stunning. I always enjoy watching him

character only with the expression of his eyes and the director uses
them well. Colin Farrell does a good job, the other characters are OK

1712,7.5,3.9,"You know the saying ""What goes around, comes around"" ? That really
applies to seven friends who graduated together and share a terrible
secret with each other. Until the group of friends slowly starts to
shrink, because they are murdered one by one. Now, when hearing the
stories of these annoying bullies, you're inclined to think they had it
coming. Because the tricks they played upon their fellow students (and
even teachers), wasn't something to be taken lightly. Those jokes were
so radical, a fellow student got killed. And now there appears to be
someone who wants to take revenge on this gang of clowns. And the way
they are killed, is linked to a particular joke they've pulled.""Kill Game"" isn't an unbelievable good horror. But it tries to honour
the traditions of the better hacker / slasher films from the 70s (for
instance ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th""). So this means that a group
of stupid and arrogant teenagers is gathered again to serve as cattle
for slaughter. And the mysterious serial killer wears a grim mask, of
course. In this case, it's a Marilyn Monroe mask. Also a list of all
candidate murderers is needed. This list may turn out to be
exceptionally long. After counting all fellow students and teachers who
were victims of a malicious prank, you'll get a significant number of
candidates. And as a highlight, the twin brother of the poor devil who
didn't survive a joke appears.But beyond these few similarities with older slasher films, this is a
film that effortlessly will sink into oblivion. Anyhow, the lousy
acting (inherent to this kind of films) and the not so original
story-line are also present. What remains is a typical game of guessing
who's the perpetrator, what's the motive and who'll eventually survive.
And there's also someone whose profile complies with the
characteristics of the perpetrator. Obviously that's a wrong
assumption. How surprising! Indeed, a stack of known clichés. The only
thing that remains is how the victims were killed. So, it isn't exactly
breathtaking cinema. The only thing I've learned out of this movie, is
that it isn't very smart to bully others.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",102,2017

1714,13.25,0.0,"""Strange Invaders"" is a cheerful and likable 80's movie, regretfully
forgotten these days because nowadays audiences don't understand the
charm and inside jokes of authentic ""Alien Invaders""-science fiction
from the 1950's. This movie is one giant spoof/tribute to wonderful
films such as ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Invaders from
Mars"", but the screenplay is intelligent enough to add new and
surprisingly original twists of its own. We have the typical remote
American town  Centerville, Illinois  getting colonized by hideous
aliens that take over the identities of the locals and examine the
earthly life-style in the meantime. The ingenious elements in the
script are, however, that this whole invasion-project was seemly
approved by the government AND that the aliens never evolved after they
landed on our planet. Centerville still looks like a swinging 50's
town, with jukeboxes, old cars and traditional dress codes. University
professor Charles Bigelow teams up with a gossip-journalist Betty
Walker to investigate the town's bizarre secret. ""Strange Invaders"" is
well-directed by Michael Laughlin (""Dead Kids"") and cleverly co-written
by Bill Condon. There's very few gore, which is a good thing, but the
special effects are definitely not bad with a couple of adorable
space-ship designs and the aliens' inventive method to ""cristalyze""
people. The acting performances are vivid, with Paul LeMat (""American
Graffiti) and Nancy Allen (""Carrie"", ""Dressed to Kill""). The supportive
cast is even better with spirited roles from Michael Lerner, Diana
Scarwid and the wonderful Louise Fletcher, once again as the mean
shrew. The happy-ending is somewhat lame and far too Disney/Steven
Spielberg-like, but I suppose that's forgivable. Good, cheesy and
nostalgic 80's entertainment.",0,1983
1715,7.833333333333333,7.9,"I watched this movie because I wanted to know a little bit more about
N.W.A and their history. After finishing the movie I can say I was
pleased with the movie and had a good time while watching it but there
is nothing really great about it.The performances are pretty good and everyone portrayed their character
in a very good and realistic way. The way in which they incorporated
the rap music was very good and the soundtrack is great of course.I have to say that the most interesting parts of the movie are the
beginning and the middle. When we can see the whole group together and
we see them do all kinds of crazy sh*t. In the third act of the film,
you get what happens after N.W.A gets separated and everyone goes in
their own path and it wasn't really that interesting. I really wasn't
that invested in the story by the third act.I think that the main problem with the movie is the pacing and the
story itself. The pacing is kinda off and sometimes you couldn't tell
how much time had passed between different events. Also, the story does
not lend itself to a very straight forward narrative. I think that they
tried to cover a lot of events that happened and that led to damaging
the story-line of beginning-middle-End.The problem is this: The beginning is the formation and rise to fame of
N.W.A. The middle is the golden years of N.W.A and the album ""Straight
outta Compton"". The end should be when Ice Cube leaves N.W.A and the
whole group disintegrates, but they preferred to cover the story until
the death of Eazy-E, which makes the third act feel like a whole
different movie.Also, since the producers of this film are Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, they
decided to take out a lot of events and things that they did in order
to protect their status. I think it is okay to protect yourself if you
are the producer, but because of that they kind of make themselves look
wiser and on top of the situation when they really weren't.In the end, it is an OK movie. You can watch it and have a good time
with it, but do not expect anything great.",147,2015
1716,9.75,5.3,"I saw this film without knowing anything about Brian Nichols and his
story and I enjoyed it. I then saw the low ratings and mixed reviews
and i wondered why. I'd classify it as drama/thriller: the tension is
present throughout the movie but the main feature is the development of
the two leading characters. David Oyelowo's acting is solid but it's
above all Kate Mara's performance that strikes the viewer with her
portrait of a troubled woman trying to make sense of her life. The
interaction between the two, ranging from violent to almost tender, is
another leitmotif. I guess knowing the ending takes away a lot of the
suspense making it predictable hence my summary line. All cast is up to
the task and delivers nuanced work.",97,2015
1717,9.666666666666666,5.7,"Let me start by saying that I regard Terrence Malick as the sole
currently working director who can be spoken of with the same reverence
as that for the great early masters of cinema  Welles, Chaplin,
Hitchcock, Renoir (make your own list). Since 'The Tree of Life' - even
since 'The New World', I have thought of him as the saviour of modern
cinema from the slurry of bland naturalism.But the enormous stylistic advances in cinematic expression that have
characterised his recent works have come at a price, and the price is
clarity of vision. We do not necessarily need to *know* what his images
represent, but we need to *feel* it. Occasionally in 'The Tree of
Life', frequently in 'To the WONDER' and most of the time in 'Knight of
Cups' most people would, I suspect, be at a loss to rationally explain
the relevance of much of Malick's visual expression. (They don't always
'feel' right, either.)So (after three viewings) I offer my 'guide' to this enigmatic film.
The 'story' (no story) of 'Knight of Cups' is that of a 'celebrity'
Rick (Christian Bale) on the loose in Hollywood, who has lost his moral
compass and lives a life of total debauchery drifting from one soulless
sexual encounter to another in between failed relationships.This is represented in a kaleidoscopic torrent of imagery reminiscent
of the works of Bruce Connor in the 1960s. Bale does the best he can
with the central role of Rick, a 'celebrity' in Hollywood, but, like
Sean Penn in 'The Tree of Life', he has really drawn the short straw,
as he, like Ben Affleck, Penn and Richard Gere before him tries to
wordlessly express his response to ambiguous emotional and moral
situations.Malick, to his credit, tells us what the film is about in an opening
voice-over, which recounts a story ('Hymn of the Pearl') from Acts of
Thomas in the Apocrypha. A king sends his son to search for a pearl in
a foreign land. The pearl is to be found in the sea, protected by a
hissing serpent, but the prince is seduced by the inhabitants of the
foreign country and given a sleeping draft. After he awakes, he has
forgotten not only what he came for, but even that he is a prince.Much of the first half of the film memorably (but not graphically)
depicts the life of total decadence that Rick finds in Tinseltown. But
this is interspersed with encounters  real or imagined, present or
past  with people from his former life  wife, brother, father.The term 'emotional roller coaster' is often inappropriately used, but
here it is very precisely apt, as one has the sense of Rick being
propelled down paths he'd rather not take by external forces over which
he has lost control. But, for me, at least, this section is too long
and suffers from overkill, in the 'when you've seen one, you've seen
'em all' sense. The rest of the film follows Rick in his attempts to make sense of his
life and find 'the pearl', and, to be fair, the film does give the
sense of an inexorable move in this direction which aids dramatic
tension and gives clarity in some measure. As in 'To the WONDER', with
the story of the crisis of faith of the priest, here also there are
tangential sections in which compassion is seen as the alter ego of
passion, and the place of young children adds positive emotion to an
otherwise extremely bleak, if dazzlingly beautiful work.Yes, Malick's unique visual lyricism is frequently on display, but, I
would have to say that it seems less well integrated into the work's
thematic thrust than it is in other of his films, but I could be
mistaken here and I will be wanting to see it at least four or five
more times when it opens in France in a couple of months.Visually it is, from time to time, spectacular; sometimes Malick's
montages are breathtaking, but there are great mysteries here that I
have not come near to fathoming even after three viewings. Frequent
shots of high-flying passenger jets, fast-moving shots from the front
of a car on desert roads and long-held bleak landscapes from Death
Valley and environs punctuate the film. It is not difficult to see the
'meaning' that these images carry, but it is difficult to know why they
are repeated so often. If I sound disappointed, I have not deceived, but Malick, with his
entire work, has set the bar so high that anything not bordering on
masterpiece simply has to be a disappointment. I drove a thousand
kilometres to see this film and back again, and I do not regret the
time and effort, but this is a desperately difficult work to fathom
and, frankly, for me, makes 'To the WONDER' look like a model of
clarity.I see it as the third (and sadly least) in an intensely personal
trilogy for Malick. So where next?",118,2015

Stanley Milgram the person. It only starts with his 1961 experiment
(which occurred nearly around the same time as the Eichmann trials and
Hannah Arendt's writings and hence garnered even more interest). It
then continues to show the travails that he passed, his life and how
the experiment changed people's perceptions towards him (some
interesting reactions here - do watch it and be prepared for the
surprises)! For such a popular experiment, there is a surprising lot
that many of us (e for certain) may not have known - the film fills in
that (large) gap.There is one big difference between this film and the similar 2015 film

after watching it, I can say that I was pleased with my choice. I
thoroughly enjoyed the storyline. At the beginning of the movie, I
wasn't sure that Allie Deberry as Kacie, the main character, would
capture my sympathy, but she did. She even managed to evoke a few
feel-good tears from me near the end of the movie. One character I was
drawn to was Rex, played by Lance Henriksenkind, tough, and patient
all rolled into one. I did disagree with some of the direction in the
film; the main instance that comes to mind occurs when Kacie races back
into a burning barn to rescue a campereveryone just watches from a
distance (even Rex; they call for her to stop, but not a sole takes a
step toward her); no one helps even after she exits dragging an
unconscious male camper until she collapses. But while I noticed things

1726,10.333333333333334,6.3,"The Spikes Gang was made back in the days when Ron Howard was your
prototypical golly gee whiz teenager, just a number of months after
American Graffiti, and in the same year which Howard's TV sitcom Happy
Days premiered. So there he was, still right smack dab right there in
the midst of being the golly gee whiz teen-aged lad. He was what he
was, and that's exactly what he was. Howard stayed with his acting
career for awhile after this, through the 70s, but he never really
broke out of that mold. If he had stuck with acting a little longer
perhaps he might have been able to broaden his range. Or, on the other
hand, maybe it's for the best that he didn't, since he actually did go
on to have a remarkable career behind the camera.The point being is that there is a bit of a surprise here, a difference
between this and other Ron Howard acting vehicles, because here Ron
Howard actually plays slightly against type, not entirely the innocent
lad we usually see. This story has an edge, a serious steely edge,
sometimes subtle, sometimes not, but definitely always there, and Les
(Ron Howard's character) and his two buddies learn some things about
life the hard way, harder in fact than one might have expected in a Ron
Howard movie in those days. Another edge this film dances on is a
precarious edge, at times the film dangles towards being a comedy of
sorts, an amusing coming-of-age story, but at other times towards a
deadly-serious drama. Robert Fleischer was an experienced and
accomplished director. He knew what he was doing, and he did it well.Lee Marvin is very good in this movie, as he usually was in most all of
his performances. That alone is enough to commend it. And that's not
all there is.I would compare this movie to The Shootist. While certainly the stories
and the themes they paint are very different, and the the dynamics of
the characters are very different, the two films nevertheless operate
on about the same plane, and some similarities do exist. Ron Howard
learning hard truths about life from Lee Marvin. Ron Howard learning
hard truths about life from John Wayne. The Shootist is noted for being
John Wayne's last movie. The Spikes Gang has no such hook, and so it
fell into obscurity. But my guess is that someone who likes one film

can make so many different kinds of films well. His range is truly
extraordinary. The man who gave us Chinatown, Pianist, Rosemary's Baby
has now directed Oliver Twist. I've seen most of the versions of Twist
but this is by far the best. David Leans version is often talked about
but it is overpraised. It tends to be overly sentimental an very slow
in certain places. I'm not for fast moving movies but his version can
be quite dull at times. Polanski's film has updated a great story with
lush photography of pastoral settings and the narrative moves briskly.
He manages to develop the characters quite well despite the pace. The
acting from all is superb especially Ben Kingsley who is barely
recognizable. I've never been a fan of great books that have been
adapted to film but Polanski seems to have a real knack for this sort
of thing. He filmed Tess (also an adaptation) 25 years back with an
Academy award nominated direction. That film is one of my all time
favorites but Oliver Twist is even better. Polanski seems to get better
with age. I can't wait to see what he does next.",130,2005

didn't know what to think as i watched it again. But to my surprise it is
still charming, funny and sweet. Enter Chevy Chase as the last family guy,
just wanting to spend time with his loving family. A hilarious journey from
Chicago to California to get to an amusement park. You may think, that
shouldn't be a problem, but it is. This is one vacation you will never
forget. I have always liked Chevy Chase and if you watch this movie you will
know why. The sweet caring family man losing more and more of his mind is
nothing less than funny as hell. Maybe you will think twice about taking
your family on vacation after watching this movie. I rate this movie

toymaker with a girlfriend named Kim Brandon (Rachel Ticotin). Her
ex-husband NYPD detective Mike Brandon asks him to use his skills to
help catch a killer. As the other cops go off to take down the suspect,
a mysterious assassin kills Mike. Rollie records Lt. Ray Silak
tampering with the murder weapon. The assassin tracks down Rollie and
Leo McCarthy (Brian Dennehy) saves him in the nick of time.The most memorable thing in this movie is Rollie's man-size mechanical
clown with a control bodysuit. It's a double-edge sword. It's fun at
first but Rollie looks sillier and sillier with the control suit. In
fact, a lot of this movie is pretty silly. A lot of the traps are
reminiscent of ""Home Alone"" with chemicals and bigger tech.Along with all the gadgetry, one of the things that Rollie is known for
is his avoidance of guns. He's a MacGyver in that way. However this can
go too far. In one scene, he grabs the assassin's gun in the aquarium
while he's being drowned. Then for some reason he leaves it behind for
the assassin to pick up and shoot at him. It's annoying when smart
characters do stupid things. This is simply inferior to the original.

high class kitchen, that you could fill pages with them. Too many
inconsistencies, one after another. Examples: a two-star Michelin chef
does not ""do everything"" by himself, shouting constantly at all his
staff; he does not do the starters, the main courses AND dessert. There
are ""sub-chefs"" who specialize in different items.The film is so full of Hollywood clichés... It's ""one of Hollywood's

1734,9.666666666666666,6.9,"I saw the movie that at the New Directors/New Films film festival in
New York in March 2015. I read Phoebe Gloeckner's graphic novel that
the film was based on. Although I did enjoy the book, I did struggle
with the characters and a lot of the things the characters were doing,
but I couldn't wait to read it every night. I loved the way she told
the story of a 15-year-old girl that has just started an affair with
her mother's boyfriend in 1970's San Francisco.I was drawn to read the book and see the movie because I am a huge
Alexander Skarsgård fan and I love to support his films. His character,
Monroe Rutherford, seemed like a total jerk in the book. Alex's take on
the character was much sweeter. Sure, the content is the same, but the
characters in the movie (ALL of the characters) seemed much more
likable in the movie. It was hard to see why Minnie would be so into
Monroe in the book, but it is quite evident in the movie. Besides
Alex's handsome good looks, his Monroe is a happy-go-lucky guy that
shows he has a heart. (Very caring) Not that I think that having an
affair with your girlfriend's 15-year-old daughter is a good thing or
appropriate, you can see how a situation like this could happen
(especially in that household). The fact that he could take a character
like Monroe and make him so likable, convinces me that this is his best
performance to date.Minnie is the kind of girl that loves to be touched and show affection.
She is a highly talented girl that has so much going on around her, and
she is receptive to take it all in. I'm happy to see the way that the
director/screenplay writer Marielle Heller told her story. I had heard
some people said there were cringe-worthy scenes, but I didn't feel
that way.Sure there are plenty of sex and drug scenes in the movie but they are
done fairly quickly and with respect and are essential to the story.
There is humor throughout and lots of animation in the style of Phoebe
Gloeckner and Aline Kominsky.As I said earlier, I didn't care for the characters in the book as much
as I did in the film. Bel Powley is SUPERB as Minnie (you never do
detect her natural British accent). Kristen Wiig still plays an awful
mother, but you can tell she cares, but in her own way. Christopher
Meloni was a caring and humorous ex-step-father. I also enjoyed
Madeleine Waters as Kimmie and Margarita Levieva as Tabatha which were
two of the characters I particularly didn't like in the book.Marielle's take on the book was superb. This was a passion project for
her and it shows. I hope to see more of her work in the future. Brandon Trost won the Cinematography award at Sundance and you will see
why. It just doesn't feel like any other movie I have seen. It is such
a stand-out film.THE DIARY OF A TEENAGE GIRL was an excellent movie and I cannot wait to
see it again and again. I hope it has a soundtrack because I definitely
want to buy it. It may not be suitable to see with the family, but
definitely grab your best friend and go!",102,2015
1735,11.75,5.1,"*spoilers ahead*In the original Contracted, characters lacked even the most basic logic
in nearly all of their decisions. I won't recount the details, since
they've been thoroughly torn to shreds by others, but shamefully, all
of these prior mistakes have been carried over to and made worse in
this abysmal sequel. The film begins with Riley (the male who slept with zombie Sam towards
the end of the first film), who is talking with a Scottish-accented
(wtf) police detective about the body count that amassed in the last
day. Instead of revealing what has actually occurred, he provides only
the bare minimum. Okay, I guess after sleeping with decomposing
maggot-girl and then stabbing a reanimated corpse in the mouth with a
kitchen knife didn't cause Riley to stumble a bit in his standoff with
the interrogator. He's let free from the police. It's not like his
fingerprints, semen, and blood weren't at the crime scene, right? I
mean, no worries. Riley goes to a doctor (who is also his brother in law.) He wants to
get tested for ""everything"" but won't give the doc any further details.
Good thinking, Riley. I'm sure a blood test one day after sleeping with
a zombie will clear everything up for you. Especially if you don't tell
your doctor what actually happened. And oh yeah, the claw marks on your
back with the fingernail you removed yourself? No biggie. That yellow
puss is probably nothing the doctor needs to look at. Carry on!The film continues with the villain, ""BJ,"" stalking Riley for reasons
that aren't explained. I mean, why does he care if Riley spoke to the
police? The virus is already released and spreading. How could Riley
have any info for the police that is worth jeopardizing the entire
operation for? So, he saw BJ with Sam in the car. Does that matter so
much? Another character that behaves without logic and whose actions
serve only to progress the plot. Riley lives with his elderly grandmother. He accidentally infects her
with the virus by leaving his toothbrush next to hers in the bathroom.
Doesn't take much to spread this, I guess. So why does BJ make such a
fuss about sleeping with women to spread it? If he wants to destroy
humanity, all he has to do is smear some of the virus in public places
where thousands will come in contact with it. But I digress. Riley goes to a memorial service for Alice (the zombie friend he
stabbed) attended by friends and family. His sister gives a speech and
some dude plays a shitty song on acoustic guitar in her memory. While
this was occurring, Riley begins having head pains and bends over in
agony. Blood drips in large thick drops from his nose and lands in some
kind of dip. Mind you, his doctor/brother-in-law is standing right next
to him in the room and even whispers something unintelligible to him
while he's doubled over. Does he offer him help? No. Does he go with
him to the bathroom to see what's happening? No. Apparently he missed
the bloody agony 12 inches away from him. Thanks doc! In the bathroom,
Riley sneezes and a massive amount of blood is spewed all over the
mirror. He tries to clean it up and while doing so, talks to his date,
Harper, through the door. She wants to know if he's OK. He says he's
fine and then suggests they go for a drink. Yep, you heard that right.
He blew chunky blood out of his nose, barely cleans it up, and then
thinks a drink with a date is a good idea.They go to a bar and Harper kisses him before heading to the bathroom.
Riley is then drugged by BJ, threatened, and apparently brought home
and placed in bed. He wakes up the next day even sicker than before. He
goes to Harper's college and pulls her out of class. She is visibly
very ill. As ill as Riley. I guess the disease progresses at different
rates in different people? One of Harper's classmates tries to
intervene and remove Riley, but Harper pukes blood all over him and
they leave. Riley is convinced he can find a cure for the plague and enlists Harper
to help track down and confront BJ. Harper ends up plucking out her
eyeball and Riley tends to his own maggot-infested decomposing body.
They then go to their drug-dealer friend's apartment and attempt to buy
guns from him. The Riley threatens him with a gun because he thinks he
has info that can lead him to BJ. The detective arrives and breaks up
the gun deal. Riley and Harper are taken to the hospital, but one-eyed
Harper dies. In case you were wondering, no, you won't care if she dies
or not. In fact, due to the complete lack of humanity and any
believable character development in this film, you won't care about
anything or anyone. That's a promise.In the Hospital, BJ shows up with some kind of suicide-zombie vest on
and begins revealing his plans to obliterate mankind, like all good
villains do. Long story short, a zombified Riley jumps to save the
detective who is in a standoff with BJ. After a brief, laughably
undeserved montage of our not-hero, the detective shoots zombie Riley
and we cut to credits. Midway through the credits, it is revealed that
the doctor from the first film was in cahoots with BJ all along. I
guess they wanted to make his apparent ineptness in the first film seem
more believable. It didn't. OK, so, we're set up for Phase 3. I will watch it. Not because I want
to, but because like all good train wrecks, I'm compelled to do so.",78,2015
1736,4.666666666666667,6.7,"I saw ""Paper Man"" recently in the favor of seeing Jeff Daniels act in a
newer movie. And it is a job well done.This is fantastic indie movie and a strong directorial/writing debut
for Kieran and Michele Mulroney. The casting is interesting and diverse
adding in the likes of Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, and Kieran Culkin
(who may I add surprised me very much). Each actor turns in their roles
well for what they're meant to be. And I must say the film explores
many intriguing concepts of one's mind, suggesting also how two people
can be so different in age and still relate to how the other is
feeling. It is heartfelt and very sentimental. The friendship between
Daniels and Stone is sweet and quite emotionally driven. The roles of
Reynolds and Culkin add another level to the movie's superiority
because they change the film from being ""your everyday drama among
friends and family"" to a individualistic adventure for one's identity
in the cruel place that is the world.**A twist toward the end made me give this movie another bonus. It was
unpredictable (at least for me) and allowed everything to tie together.It's definitely above average and a movie I plan on watching many more
times in the future. Plus, Jeff Daniels always hands in a great act.",110,2009
1737,7.2,5.7,"On it's own it's a goofy yet poignant musical. A little boring, if I'm
being honest.But with the name ""Chi-Raq"" and it being set in Chicago and it dealing
with the gun violence in Chicago, the movie is worse than just bad.
Chiraq is a real term that real kids in real bad neighborhoods came up
with to describe their environment. Chicago's murder rate doesn't look
like much when taken as a whole but when you realize that 99% of it
occurred in just a few of Chicago's many neighborhoods, you'll
understand why those unfortunate kids from those neighborhoods chose
this term. These are not white neighborhoods, mind you, remember that
Chicago is the most segregated city in America. These kids really have
seen more literal dead bodies growing up than most soldiers have seen
in Iraq. The term is as offensive and loud as possible because it's
meant to get your attention. It is a very literal cry for actual help
in every sense of the word.Spike Lee takes this term and honors the meaning behind it by
completely ignoring those cries for help. He chooses to use Chicago to
tell some story about how a sex strike maybe solved a civil war one
time so yeah that could totally solve all the dead bodies that pile up
in Englewood and Fuller Park every year. And the corrupt governmental
system keeping it secret and confined to black neighborhoods.The most obvious example of Spike Lee completely missing what's really
going on in the *real* Chiraq is the fact that the gangs in his film
beef over colors. Don't nobody care what colors you wear in Chiraq,
your chances of being killed are the same regardless. That's some goofy
west coast crap. Modern gangs in the real Chiraq form simply out of
safety in numbers. Activities vary set by set, block by block. Conflict
typically stems from disputes over sex and violence. This is what
motivates *most* violence in America, however when it happens on the
South Side, it gets labeled ""gangland violence"" and then gets mostly
ignored by media outlets. Simple things get overlooked like how a lot of these deaths could be
avoided simply by building a closer trauma center to these
neighborhoods so it doesn't take an ambulance over an hour to get to
the scene. How more educational and work force centers can provide
direction to directionless kids with no hope. How proper legal
representation and education could ensure we're not occasionally
sending innocent kids to jail to learn how to become a savage along
with the rest of them. These are all common things you'll find missing
from most of these consistently super high crime areas in Chicago. It's gotten bad in Chicago. And when I say bad, I mean real bad.
Someone needs to shine a light on what's really going on because it's
gone way beyond any other place in America. Way worse than you're
imagining. The only thing a sex strike would do on the South Side is
make the already high sexual assault rate climb even higher. And that's
just real talk.Which Spike Lee's ""Chi-Raq"" continues to ignore by examining none of
those things. In Spike Lee's world, it's almost like he's saying it's
black people's fault the murder rate is so high in places like Austin
and West Englewood. Like he's saying ""You girls maybe need to stop
putting out so much, that's the problem."" 1 out of 10 stars, no
sympathy for those who chose to ignore real cries for real help from an
entire group of disenfranchised youth.",127,2015
1738,7.4,8.0,"I don't usually like to give movie reviews - but it was a hot weekend
and I figured maybe I'd venture out and see what the culture had to
offer. So just how bad was ""The Martian?"" So bad that after an hour I
realized I would rather be back in the sweltering 97 degree heat than
sitting in an air conditioned theater listening to anymore inane dialog
(lines like ""F**k you Mars!"" and ""I'm going to science the S**T out of
it!"") In fact it would appear that a prerequisite for going into the
space program is at least six months of doing stand up. (BAD stand up.)
Why does everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) in the movie sound like one of
those guys on ""The Big Bang Theory?"" Snarky and idiotic and always
cracking wise. Also: Why did every character, while typing, READ what
he's typing out loud? Has anyone ever done this EVER? And what was with
all the expository dialog, (the whole script was expository as far as
I'm concerned) Throughout the movie Matt Damon talks into a video
camera, making a diary and yet he only says things that everyone who
would potentially WATCH the video would of course already know, things
like: ""Oh yeah, did I tell you? I'm a botanist."" It's clear he was
attempting to speak directly to the viewer and NOT the imaginary
audience in the movie itself. This is the laziest kind of writing there
is. They don't know how to deliver plot anymore except to dump bowling
balls of ham fisted information in your lap; telling you things you've
already figured out in the most obvious way possible. That meant that
there was absolutely ZERO tension. It was like reading an instruction
manual for a microwave oven. ""How do I grow potatoes? Oh look there's
some poo."" (cue the laugh track) And Ridley Scott's direction was as
slack as an industrial film. False stakes, false resolutions, false
falseness. Now,I know I only managed to make it through the first hour
or so; maybe it got really good after that, but I was starting to feel
my brain cells beginning to atrophy so it was from a sense of self-
preservation that I skedaddled out of there when I did. (And don't get
me started on the disco songs and requisite jokes about 'bad musical
taste.' It was just more target-market reconstituted nostalgia-bait.)

1740,1.0,5.1,"PRISON RIOT is another B-movie thriller set in a violent prison, where
an undercover cop is gunning for revenge against the crime boss who had
his family killed. Although Dolph Lundgren features predominantly on
the box art, he's actually playing in support here, with the main role
given over to unknown actor Matthew Reese. There's also a third
character, played by Danielle Chuchran, who seems to have been added to
the mix to bring in some female-on-female action.Inevitably, the plotting and narrative of PRISON RIOT aren't up to
much, but the focus is instead on plentiful action sequences. And the
good news is that they're pretty good. Gone are the lumbering, slow
fights of many a 1990s-era straight-to-VHS fight flick; instead, we get
martial arts-themed bouts that have clearly been inspired by the likes
of THE RAID. I'm talking multiple opponents and weapons, actors being
thrown around the sets, and mucho violence.Things culminate in a large-scale prison riot - as the title would
suggest - which doesn't disappoint. Yes, the acting is rather wooden,
with only Lundgren bringing some of his trademark charm to the
proceedings, but when a film offers up a wealth of hard-hitting action
it doesn't matter too much. Given that I'm a massive fan of THE RAID,
any film which seeks to imitate that film is okay in my book, and
PRISON RIOT hits the mark nicely.",87,2015

Johnny's hiding place, Shell's odd room full of canaries, the elaborate
Victorian tavern,the snow covering Johnny as he lies unconscious. I
love the Third Man but this is by far my favorite Carol Reed
production. It is slow and contemplative and transforms essential
theological and philosophical concepts into visual media. It is strange
and almost at times hallucinatory, but after all Johnny is often
hallucinating in his pain and fever and this dreamlike quality is quite
appropriate -- the slow thoughts of a man before he dies, as he tries
to figure out what it was about and where he may be going. Reed does so
much with film without dialog -- his close-ups of faces, his soft, dark

1745,9.75,5.2,"Although the dialogue and characters in this movie aren't bad, it's
practically unwatchable due to the lack of plot, and terrible directing
and editing. Here are some problems with this movie: The house has at
least 10 cameras inside, but no smoke detectors or burglar alarm? There
are at least 5 scenes where the heroine tries and fails to open windows
throughout the house. Why? Are they locked from the outside??? In one
scene she unties her boyfriend and his mother and here are their
reactions: The boyfriend sits there all self satisfied, useless and
relieved as if he just got done taking a huge crap. The mother decides
to scream at the top of her lungs as if it never occurs to her to keep
her voice down. Later in the movie the mother inexplicably has a
shotgun (the shotgun was left outside in the previous scene, so how
does the mother who was locked in a cupboard now have it?) In another
scene the bad guy is climbing a ladder to get the heroine. The view
will find himself thinking ""Hit him in the head as he is climbing the
ladder"" but instead she just screams and cries, even though she already
stabbed him with scissors twice in the previous scene. The viewer
thinks she finally worked up the courage to do something smart or
effective, but no. There were only about 3 good scenes in the whole
movie and here are some other plot holes: The criminals don't bring any
supplies but when they suddenly need a power drill it's just laying on
the table. Likewise when they need gasoline they find a jug of gasoline
in the boyfriends bedroom! ALMOST NO ONE KEEPS JUGS OF GASOLINE LAYING
AROUND THEIR BEDROOM! There are a LOT of problems with this movie and I don't want to go on
forever but perhaps the biggest one that I haven't mentioned yet is the
terrible editing/sound. Every shot and every scene, even the mundane
ones like an argument between mother and son, has terrible spooky sound
effects and noises as if this were a roman Polanski horror film. It
might not have been so bad except it's in EVERY scene. So when the bad
guys actually enter the house you already want to turn the movie off
because you're so annoyed. And the editing: the house has 10 security
cameras and every time we are watching a scene through a security
camera the image flickers and distorts while all this scary music
plays. It's as if they thought they were editing ""The Ring"". Also,
every cut, every dissolve, is done with an accompanying horrible sound
effect. This isn't even a horror movie lol! I don't know what they were
thinking. I do want to mention that some of the dialogue and characters are
pretty good, although each bad guy inexplicably wants to tell his life
story to the heroine. The first time this happens it makes sort of
sense cause the guy is really stressed and just sort of talking. But in
the very next scene another bad guy tells her his life story! And these
stories aren't even interesting they are much like the plot of the
movie: nothing happens! The director apparently did Shakespeare and other off-Broadway plays
before this his feature debut. You would think the directing would be
better, but I guess all those years of doing plays left him with the
unquenchable thirst to add endless sound effects and editing tricks to
his first movie. He should have watched Glenn Gary Glenn Ross or The
Six Degrees of Separation to learn how to translate play-directing to
movie-directing. But he didn't and instead produced this piece of crap
movie that I can't believe I finished watching. I'd love to talk about
all the plot holes and stupid things that happen in the end of the
movie (like the house exploding or the fact that the fire department
never comes even though they live in a rich neighborhood). In
conclusion, I wouldn't let the director or editor of this movie
anywhere near another film project, ever (unless it was like Hellraiser
6 or some other stupid movie where a million spooky sound effects every
scene might be fitting. I had a reoccuring thought while I was watching
this movie and I still don't know the answer: ""Boy that scene had a lot
of problems, why didn't anyone care?"" Maybe the director will write an
essay one day explaining how movies turn out like this.",80,2015

done through visual information. The impact of this is lost when the
cinematography is altered. Remember that Nestor Almendros received an
Academy Award nomination for his work on this film. The film has resonated
with global audiences for so long for this very reason. I suggest people
watch the dvd commentary with Randal Kleiser and Brooke Shields to get a
better understanding of why this film is still such a popular one.People attack the acting, but these are children left alone with no one to
guide them into adult sophistication. Their interaction and reactions to
situations are very consistent with this scenario. Yes, the birth scene is a
little rushed, but do we really need to see the umbilical cord? Not all
films need to be about gritty reality, ala ""Taxi Driver."" No one asks to see

his little family before they becomes a show biz disaster.(My Comment) I enjoyed this movie because it brought back good
memories. I can't believe that their first song was recorded 50 years
ago. They have that certain sound that just makes you smile when you
hear them. You recognize their sound immediately. The animated
characters of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are lovable now as they were
50 years ago. I always liked it when Dave would scream the name of
""Aaaaalviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnn!!!"" and Alvin would say ""OooooK!!!"" Those
two words just make you smile. Children of all ages can see this movie
without any problem. I am sure that all the parents will like it, and I
know your child will, because it is a fun movie. (20th Century Fox, Run

1748,10.25,6.3,"It turns out that birds aren't the only critters to have given actress
Tippi Hedren a rough time on screen! In ""Roar"" (1981), a film that
Tippi and her then-husband Noel Marshall--along with sons John and
Jerry and daughter Melanie Griffith--star in (Tippi and Noel also
wrote, produced and directed), all manner of wild animals turn up to
give the actress some fairly tense moments. In this virtually plot less
film, a mother and her three kids go to Africa to visit their scientist
husband/father after an absence of three years. Dad's not at home when
they arrive, but around 30 large cats--lions, tigers, jaguars,
etc.--are, and proceed to chase the family all around the abode. These
animals are never shown in a bad light, however; this is very much a
pro-conservation film that espouses all wildlife causes. That is all
well and good, but the film's primary appeal, it must be said, is the
Marshalls' fearless interaction with the big cats. Seeing Noel dive
into a group of fighting lions and come out bloodied but happily
beaming is really quite remarkable. Tippi reveals herself to be quite
an extraordinary stuntwoman, too; just watch her get tossed about by an
elephant, fall off a tipping ladder into a pond, climb down a
waterwheel, and roll around with the lions! We are told at the
picture's beginning that no animals were harmed during its (11-year!)
filming; I for one could use a further reassurance about the movie's
humans! Siegfried & Roy, eat your hearts out; no lion tamer act will
ever seem impressive after one sees what Noel and family do during the
course of this film! ""How did they ever make this thing?"" is the
question that springs to mind constantly during a viewing of ""Roar"";
the human-animal interactions shown are like nothing you have ever
seen. In that, it is a completely sui generis experience, and, despite
a few genuinely scary moments, perfectly suitable for watching with the
kiddies. Very highly recommended.",102,1981

the show from Hutton. The Paul Robeson (Monitor label) recordings also
add to the picture's stunning realism. This is certainly one of the
better movies of the early 1980's. The E.L. Doctorow screenplay is

1750,8.25,5.9,"""The Return of Jafar"" isn't as good as ""Aladdin"" but, to be fair, it
isn't that bad for a Disney sequel either. There are much worst Disney
sequels than this, made after this.""The Return of Jafar"" continues the story of the original ""Aladdin"":
now Aladdin and Jasmine are married and live together in the palace,
the genie returns from his vacations, Iago escapes from Jafar and
becomes a «good guy» and Jafar returns with the help of a new villain
(a thief called Abis Mal).Naturally that this movie isn't as good as the first one, like I said.
Why? There are many reasons why. The story is more lame. The artwork
looks more poor comparing to the first one (which is more refined and
more according to Disney's standards). The humor isn't as funny and
classic. The colorful imagination, creativity and magic of the first
one are gone. The characters seem somehow to have lost their
personality.Speaking of the characters, let me start by Iago. He has the same
general sarcasm and I like the idea that he becomes a «good guy», but
let's be frank: he's way funnier in the first one. Jafar is now more
annoying and not as humorous as in the first one. Aladdin, Jasmine and
the Sultan seem to have lost some of their maturity. The Genie is still
funny, but without the colorful imagination and brilliant sense of
humor he's got on the first one. The whole movie in general doesn't
hold a candle to the original, although it is still entertaining
enough. Besides, there is no Robin Williams here, which is a deep lost.
It also becomes tiring to see Jafar so many times as a Red Genie. The
soundtrack itself is nowhere near as impressing and memorable as on the
first one - in fact, none of the songs here really capture our
attention and hearts.Overall, this is not a bad movie. For kids it is just as recommendable
and entertaining as the first one, but for older people the first one
is, without a doubt, the best choice.",0,1994
1751,7.4,6.6,"I saw this movie today and it was just a breath of fresh air. In this
era of political correctness and the consequent surge of tragicomedies
that seem to be made to drive home the point that everything in life
must be serious, Woody, in his infinite wisdom, has prescribed us a
style of comedy often hated, misunderstood, and forgotten: the murder
comedy a la Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux. I haven't laughed this hard at
someone trying to kill another person since Preston Sturges's 1948 film
Unfaithfully Yours, even though it's ultimately a much more understated
English style of humor (very Comedy of Manners-ish.) As such, it
doesn't surprise me that Irrational Man has been hated by most critics,
since they are likely to fall into the trap of expecting that this
movie will be one of the aforementioned tragicomedies, and thus simply
think it fails to deliver. Instead, here Woody seems to find comedy in
everything from Kant to sexism to suicide to faculty gossip, and as a
consequence, the movie ends up as loose as his ""early funny movies,""
unfortunately adding just another layer that might further confuse
audiences. Essentially, if you don't find the satire quick you just
won't understand what you're watching. On the actor side of things,
Stone and Joaquin really kill it. It almost feels like they can turn
the intensity up as easily as turning a knob, and there are three
moments when you really get a sense of how far they can go.This will certainly be on a list of Woody's most underrated movies in
ten years time if the bad reception it gets doesn't slow down, and I
hope that people will take the time to realize just what this movie is
because I think they'd really have a good time watching it.",95,2015

with
the actual bombing of Japan by the Doolittle raid, very early in World War

""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" which is the story of the Doolittle raid,
including the launching of the B-52's from the U.S.S. Hornet and the raid
itself. ""The Purple Heart"" completes the cycle with the war trial of a
captured American crew which took part in the attack.One wonders how so many good things can be put into a movie which lasts
only an hour and a half. There is a trial, action, good acting, few
technical flaws, very precise and accurate dialogue, questions of honor and
decency, patriotism on all sides, questions as to the role of the media,
and
the ever present suspense of the final resolution. Lewis Milestone deserves
commendation for excellent direction, as each scene is composed to blend
well with the major ideas in the movie. There is little in the film which
is
distracting or ill-fitting. And the characters are portrayed with

genre. Star Leaf, to its credit, decides the motive should be finding
weeds. This is not so much a horror rather than a parody of one, it's
utterly bizarre and often doesn't make much sense. Characters are
partially product of satire, and it's confusingly insipid since it
opens up with heavy theme of homicide and kidnapping. The best it could
come up with is a few giggles due to its extreme oddity.Three people go into a forest to find a mysterious sage who can lead
them to a promised place of rare medication plant. Bizarre as it may
sound the following is even crazier with trippy creature or haunting

nearly everything is pointless gibberish. Fortunately, the runtime is
rather short, so it's equivalent of a weird dream.Characters would appear out of nowhere, then disappear in five minutes
as there's no consistent plot here. One can actually randomly skip a
scene or reverse them and it would be the same incoherent story.
Characters themselves are not likable, they are created for such
intended effect with hippie gibberish and blatant reference to pop
culture. The most sensible of them is surprisingly the jock stereotype,
and even he seems woozy at times.Star Leaf's best chance at entertainment is if audience is lenience and

1758,12.75,6.8,"This DVD was an impulse buy, pure and simple. My wife and I like Pierce
Brosnan, and I have enjoyed Renee Russo's other works, so what did I have to
lose? Only my mind! This film was positively one of the most enjoyable,
nail-biting, suspenseful romantic capers ever made. A remake of the steamy 1968 Steve McQueen flick updated to the sleek and
self-referential 90s, ""Thomas Crown"" features Brosnan as the title character
- a bored billionaire businessman in the business of ""acquisitions"". For a
thrill, he heists an extremely valuable Monet from the New York Museum right
under the noses of security guards, cops, and about a thousand unsuspecting
museum-goers. Renee Russo is the very sexy, very worldly Catherine Banning,
whose insurance company underwrites the painting - and she is determined to
get it back at any cost... But the cost just may be her soul as she woos,
and then falls under the spell of the enigmatic Crown. Will Russo discover
the location of the Monet? Will she rat out Thomas Crown? Or is Crown
manipulating her affections like Bobby Fisher manipulates the pieces on a
chess board?What we have here is a high-speed chase film whose vehicle is clever dialog,
rich and exotic direction, and more than a little sexual tension! Brosnan,
as Crown, is ever the cool Brit charmer whose every word and action are as
calculated as the movements of a Rolex. Russo smoulders every time she
appears on screen. And when the two of them get together, the chemical
reaction is pure dynamite.Dennis Leary has a nice bit as a streetwise NYPD detective on the case, who
dispenses advice to Russo's Banning, and watches her begin to spiral out of
control. His role here most likely resulted in the deserved attempt at a
television series on ABC (""The Job"").The action in the film moves exotically from caper to cover-up and back with
dizzying speed... All the while, we are kept guessing about the motivations
of the two lead, and find ourselves eagerly anticipating their next move.
When the final checkmate comes, we are left totally bewildered, befuddled,
and baffled... which is most-likely the director's intention!On all levels, ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" will steal the hearts of men and
women alike... but for different reasons - Men can enjoy the action and
thrill of the chase, and Crown's ability to win over the most beautiful
women and his attempt to get away with the ultimate heist... Ladies can
marvel at the suave Brosnan and his life of extreme wealth, and
all-the-while wonder if he will betray her, or if she will betray
him...I will not betray you... I ain't saying!",113,1999
1759,4.25,7.4,"This is an important commercial film aimed at blue collar women who
feel victimized by both society and the men in their lives. Directed by
Ridley Scott, who directed the science fiction classics, Alien (1979)
and Blade Runner (1982), Thelma and Louise is an on-the-lam chick flick
(with chase scenes), a kind of femme Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
(1969), somewhat akin to Wild at Heart (1990) and Natural Born Killers
(1994) but without the gratuitous violence of those films. Ridley Scott
walks the razor edge between femme-exploitation and serious social
commentary. Incidentally, the script is by Callie Khouri who wrote
Something to Talk About (1995) and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya
Sisterhood (2002) which should give you an idea of how men are depicted
here.Susan Sarandon is Louise, a thirty-something Arkansas waitress with an
attitude and some emotional baggage, and Geena Davis is Thelma, a
cloistered ingenue housewife with a yearning to breath free. Both do an
outstanding job and carry the film from beginning to end. The
characters they play are well-rounded and fully developed and
sympathetic, in contrast to the men in the film who are for the most
part merely clichés, or in the case of Darryl (Christopher McDonald),
Thelma's boorish husband, or the troll-like truck driver, burlesques.I have never seen Geena Davis better. Her unique style is melded very
well into a naive woman who never had a chance to express herself, but
goes hog wild and seems a natural at it when the time comes. Sarandon
is also at the top of her game and plays the crusty, worldly wise,
vulnerable Louise with tenderness and understanding. Note, by the way,
her pinned up in back hair-style, directly lifted from TV's Polly
Holliday (""Kiss my grits!"") who appeared as a waitress in the seventies
sitcoms ""Alice"" and ""Flo.""Harvey Keitel plays the almost sympathetic cop, Hal Slocumb, and Brad
Pitt appears as J. D., a sweet-talking twenty-something who gives
Thelma the script for robbing 7-11s as he steals more than her libido.This movie works because it is funny and sad by turns and expresses the
yearning we all have to be free of the restraints of society and its
institutions (symbolized in the wide-open spaces of the American
Southwest) while representing the on again, off again incompatibility
of the male and female heart. The male-bashing is done with a touch of
humor and the targets are richly deserving of what they get. The ending
is perhaps too theatrical and frankly unrealistic, but opinions may
differ.Best and most telling quick scene is when Thelma phones Darryl to see
if he has found out about their escapades. Weasel-like, he is trying to
help the cops locate them, but he is so transparent to her that all she
has to do is hear his voice. ""He knows,"" she says to Louise and hangs
up.Best visual is when the black police helicopter appears suddenly,
menacingly like a giant fly beneath the horizon of the Grand Canyon.
Also excellent were the all those squad cars lined up like armored
battalions aimed at the girls on the run.I also liked the scenes at the motel with J.D. and Louise's boyfriend.
They were beautifully directed and cut, and very well conveyed by
Sarandon and Davis, depicting two contrasting stages in male-female
relationships.See this for Geena Davis because she was brilliant, vividly alive and
never looked better.",130,1991
1760,8.5,7.0,"Despite being a little too by-the-book and repetitive,""Infinetly Polar
Bear"" is a pleasing piece of narrative that succeeds thanks to a
brilliant portrayal and definition of characters.As stated above the film isn't that fascinating or riveting of a drama.
It hits the same note again and again and does not stray away from it
almost anytime. It is generally predictable and the dramatic texture
isn't as intense as it wants to be,it kind of hits you very light.
Moreover there are situations that are overplayed a little too much in
the beginning which gave the movie a hard time at getting started and
being believable, yet fortunately it picked up immediately as soon as
these couple of scenes ended. So to sum it up, it simply doesn't give
the necessary gravitas and intensity (both comedic and dramatic) to the
situation for it to be as riveting as a drama as it could have as it
could have been and I should add that I think that the cinematography
partially contributed to this: it doesn't have enough style or
distinction for it to stick out, leaving it in super generic dramatic
territory and palette and it has a variety of camera movements that get
distracting and aren't integrated well enough in the story. It could
have really sparked had their been some distinctive look and approach
in my opinion.Despite all of negatives above, this movie really succeeds in making
you care about the characters, sticking with them and ultimately giving
you a true emotional link. That is undebatable thanks to very good work
from both Saldana and Ruffalo and especially the two girls playing
their daughters. But even more than that I believe that in the end it
is the script that makes you really care because of how well it defines
characters, situations and overall story arch. There maybe not enough
originality in storytelling or some non-clarity in the bipolar aspect
of the film, but man do the characters stick out and make for a
pleasant view and journey, culminating in a finale that got me more

Because if you can't, this might as well be about life on Mars.This is a smart movie. And the concept is pretty original, considering
the difficulty of deviating from the restrictions of the genre. The
leads are immensely likable and each able to toss off complex comedic
riffs with ease. And I very much enjoyed seeing Adam Scott play the
heavy. Not easy to portray a dull-as-donuts bad guy, but he pulled it
off.Despite the ""truthiness"" of the dialog, the movie does share one thing
with all romantic comedies: it's a wet dream for the love hungry.
Especially for those folks who juggle and struggle with the reality of
modern relationships. The lead characters wear a veneer of cynical
sophistication that many of us use as protective shields. But, as is

1764,3.5,5.2,"Review: I really wasn't expecting that much from this film, especially
when I saw that it had something to do with the Rettendon killings but
it actually turned out to be quite entertaining. The raw, intense and
gritty storyline was, surprisingly, quite gripping and the Essex
backdrop was put together well. The violence, sex and foul language did
go a bit over the top but that was expected from this English, gangster
type movie, which was based in Essex, at a time when the Rettendon
murders were still in people's minds. All of the actors put in a decent
performance, and they made the movie seem extremely real but the person
that I was most impressed with was Ricci Harnett (Carlton Leach), who
was pretty brutal and unlikable at the beginning but he found some
redemption towards the end. When Carlton finally decides to ""Knock It
On The Head"", to live the quiet life with his family, he is pushed to
limit and his past catches up with him, so I would like to see a 3rd
instalment, to finally see if he has turned his bad ways, to the good.
The only downfall about this film is that there are a lot of movies in
this genre which, are the same in many ways but I still stayed
interested throughout, and I found it quite enjoyable. Round-Up: This movie was also directed by Ricci Harnett, who played the
leading role, so he really did give this project his all. The London
born actor/writer/director has also starred in movies like 28 Days
Later, Vendetta starring Danny Dyer, Top Dog, the impressive Ill
Manors, the Rise & Fall of a White Collar Hooligan, and some TV series
like the Bill, Buried and Dubplate Drama. He also starred in the first
instalment of this movie, so he wasn't new to the project. Anyway, for
his directorial debut, I personally think that he done a good job with
this movie and his acting was top form but it would be good to see him
tackle another genre, because this one has been done to death.I recommend this movie to people who are into their crime movies
starring Ricci Harnett, Steven Berkoff, Luke Mably, Craig Fairbrass,
Terry Stone and Tygo Gernandt. 4/10",111,2015
1765,11.2,0.0,"The badlands of the US - Mexico border and the viciousness of the drug
trade running across it sets the background and the tone for this
movie. It's grim. Human life is very cheap and the movie doesn't flinch
from showing consequences. There are definitely some scenes that are
not for the faint hearted, but there is nothing gratuitous here. If
anything - despite the subject matter - the film goes out of its way to
avoid Hollywood heroics.Emily Blunt does an amazing job portraying Kate Macy, a career
policewoman heading a SWAT team. Her accent slips slightly a couple of
times, but otherwise she's utterly believable as born and raised in the
deep south of the US. Kate is a fundamentally decent, honorable human
being, trying to the right thing in a world where the rule book doesn't
seem to work any more. She's smart, tough, and experienced - but right
from the start of the movie, it's clear that she's in over her head.The tension never lets up. An attack could come at any moment, from any
direction. Anything could be a trap. All of it, no matter how extreme
something is, plays as real. The director manages scenes expertly to
avoid any clean and easy action movie clichés, and it pays off
enormously as the movie goes on.It's also a highly intelligent movie, made for an intelligent audience.
It doesn't lay things out on a plate. Instead you have to pay attention
and you have to think, just as Kate has to - because her first mistake
could be her last.Staging, costuming, sets, cinematography, and lighting are all perfect.
Some airborne shots in particular stand out as both daring and
stunningly original, clearly showing just how harsh the landscape is,
while managing to propel the story forward - without showing anyone, no
less. This part of the movie is in the ""As good as it gets"" category.
The only part that I didn't like (and the reason that this doesn't get
a 10 from me) was the music. It's used deliberately to heighten tension
during some scenes which would otherwise break the feel of the movie,
and generally it's done well, but some scenes are spoiled with a There
Will Be Blood styled screech. It's really not needed, especially since
Sicario's own score manages to build or maintain tension quite
successfully in other parts of the movie while remaining low-key.To my mind, this is much more of a drama than it is a thriller. It's
certainly not an action movie. The acting from the support cast is
exactly what it needs to be - good in general, and great when a minor
character is the focal point - but look closely at how much Benicio del
Toro manages to do with no dialogue and not even all that much
movement. Simply amazing.This is a great movie to see if you want to be challenged.",0,2015

over-used and abused ""home movie/shaky cam"" format. If I had come in
the theater in the middle of the movie, I might have assumed I had
accidentally wandered into the 7th, or whatever, sequel to Paranormal
Activity. And to add insult to injury M Night is about 8 years late to
the party for that trick. Or was it suppose to be some type of irony or
mocking of the standard horror movie fare? Perhaps this once creative
director has finally succumbed to audience expectations --if all you
want is cookie cutter, unimaginative, thematically barren, shaky cam,
scary movies then here you go...... Another let down for me was that in his earlier movies there were
always a number of positive sub-themes running through the movies that
I found as interesting, if not more so, than the obvious scary movie
theme. I failed to find any such redeeming parallel plot lines in The
Visit. Again maybe he is just simplifying his movies to match his
audience's wishes.On the upside, I did find this movie to be something of an improvement
over his most recent efforts. There were a few good chuckles. There
were a couple of OK jump scenes. There was some tension here and there,

how well they made it fit the genre. As such, this one is okay. You
need to see more than REC or Quarantine as progenitors. This one
involved some New York type filmmakers/actors. They did a very good job
on sets, costumes, lighting,etc. I don't look for total character
coherence in a flick in which everyone is going mad. Even, before they
went mad, they were marginally mad or disturbed to begin with. The
movie was pretty well made for a low budget effort. The only thing that
looked fake was some of the CGI blood spatter and one projectile

didn't realize it was him until I realized that he had almost the same
hairdo that he wore in Tears of the Sun.There were also a bunch of
faces that look familiar but whose names always escape you.This movie did not remind me of REC or Quarantine, as much as some say.
They were also derivative. Yes, there were many similar elements that
appeared in those films and Condemned.But if anything, this story was
absolutely most like a New York based film that predated those two. If you liked Condemned then see Mulberry Street (2006), a film with
very close themes and development. This connection jumped to mind after
the first few minutes or so of watching Condemned. The writer/star of
Mulberry St. is Nick Damici who has a small cameo in Condemned. So see
Mulberry St. and if you liked that then watch Stakeland, Damici's take
on vampires. In it you will see scenes, sets, and situations that
although not wholly original, look like they might be one of the
proximate inspirations for The Walking Dead.",83,2015
1772,3.5,4.9,"""Close Range"" boasts excellent martial arts choreography. The
hand-to-hand fights earn solid A grades, while the knife fights earn
middling Bs. Production values are adequate for the budget and genre,
although far too much reliance is placed on jiggly-cam shots. Make-up
effects are of uneven quality. The script is a mishmash of overused
tropes with just enough clever one-liners to consider a clemency plea
when they go to lynch the writer. A climatic paean to Sergio Leone is
fairly good  until they inexplicably shift POV from third-person to
first with a memory flash. With no character arcs, moral or coherent
theme, the actors don't have much to do except try to kill one another.
Several characters are dispatched for no particular reason other than
dramatic effect. Scott Adkins does an adequate job as the taciturn
loner antihero and handles the action scenes admirably, but deserves a
better script. Where the movie fails is in the gunfights, which comprise a large
portion of the running time. We should establish some basic rules for
gunfight choreographers and movie characters who find themselves in
gunfights. 1. If you have a limited amount of ammunition, you might not want to
use it all laying down suppressive fire. Save your bullets until you
have a target in sight. 2. If you've taken cover in a dimly lit house and the heavily armed bad
guys are outside in the bright sunlight, you have a huge tactical
advantage because you can see them much more easily than they can see
you. However, you sacrifice that advantage if you stand by the window
and stick the barrel of your weapon outside, because now they can see
you and you may also have the sun in your eyes. A better strategy is to
stand back away from the window and fire. If the bad guy is fifty yards
away, you don't gain much advantage by moving to where he's only
forty-nine yards away, but you sacrifice a considerable advantage. 3. If your weapon fires really big bullets that are the length of a
man's finger and have tapered casings, they probably pack a bit of a
punch and go through things like walls and the sheet metal used in
automobile bodies. You're probably better off trying to fire through
whatever the bad guy is hiding behind than firing overhead and hoping
the bullet changes course directly above him. 4. Those little metal things over the barrel and above the breech are
called sights. You stand a much better chance of hitting your target if
you use them. 5. If you've seen ""Zombieland,"" you know the advantage to a double-tap,
but the incremental advantage drops dramatically. When you have a
limited amount of ammunition, there isn't much advantage to putting
five high-power rifle rounds through somebody's chest, as opposed to
only one or two. Other than the climatic scene, the gunfight choreography was painfully
amateurish and largely nonsensical. The only purpose seemed to be to
empty the weapons so the characters would need to engage in
hand-to-hand combat. Initially, the characters seemed oblivious to the
notion that bullets can go through things, even after a character is
hit. Later, they did little except fire through walls, floors and
protective gear. The movie is a series of well choreographed fight scenes admirably
executed by Scott Adkins and his opponents, linked together by a flimsy
excuse for a plot. Fortunately, the fight scenes are worth the price of
admission.",0,2015
1773,10.571428571428571,7.1,"Got the chance to see Everest early in IMAX 3D. I'll start off by
saying this, if you get the chance, definitely see this movie in IMAX.
It adds to the experience and you feel like your on the mountain. That
aside, let's dive into one of my most anticipated films of the year.Everest is chalk full of star power. Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, Keira
Knightley, Jake Gyllenhaal, the list goes on. Everyone is believable in
this hostile environment, going from optimistic and adventurous to
mortified and forced to fight for their lives. Each character is given
a back story, some more drawn out and centered than others, and you get
attached to most but not all of them. When the emotional blows hit,
they hit hard for some, but not as much for others.The visuals are, as you might have guessed, stunning. The shots they
get of climbers and the way the camera gives you an an idea of how
dangerous this is are breath taking. The cinematography is definitely
award worthy. IMAX only added to it, putting you in this environment
and taking you along for the ride.This film really did it for me because I have always been fascinated by
Everest and the journey it is to make it up to the top and back. If
there is a Netflix documentary about Everest, I've watched it. I even
watched the one about the story told in this movie. What this film does
so well is it immerses you into the environment as well as gives you
characters to care about. It's all tied in well together.At times, the pace is a bit slower than expected and the tones shifts
from serious to light hearted are a bit messy. But that stuff doesn't
bother you in the moment, your just wrapped up in the intensity of the
story.Overall, Everest gave me exactly what I wanted. It was intense,
emotionally powerful, and the visuals were beautiful. It's not
perfectly structured, but it sure is engaging. As someone who has
studied the mountain, this offers a brutal look into how much time and
energy is out into a trip to Everest, and how quickly things can go
wrong. Definitely worth a trip to the theatre.",121,2015
1774,4.0,6.3,"'A Walk in the Woods' (2015) is the long awaited adaptation of the
beloved 1998 book by Bill Bryson. And I have to say, as a huge fan of
the book, I was extremely excited to hear that this was finally being
made into a movie. I also have to say it was one of the most
disappointing cinema experiences of my life. The film follows Robert
Redford as author Bill Bryson as he makes an ill attempted trek along
the famed Appalachian Trail with his long estranged friend Steven Katz,
played by Nick Nolte. Despite the fact that both book and film have the
same tag-line premise, this movie was about as far away from the source
material as it could possibly get. Visually speaking, it was incredibly boring. Stylistically reminiscent
of a Hallmark Channel flick, I expect to see this movie playing in the
waiting room of my local dentist office. Despite the fact that the plot
revolves around two geriatrics traversing an expansive and rugged
mountain trail, roughly two thousand miles of track stretching from
Georgia to Main, well over half of the movie takes place in diners,
motels, laundromats, and the local Kmart. What parts of the film do
take place on the trail are close shots of camping tents or convenient
mountain ledges that vaguely reveal just enough of the surrounding
nature that the audience can tell the scene takes place outdoors. This is robs the film of its core plot line. Director Ken Kwapis took
all of the natural beauty from the movie and replaced it with cheap
gags and old men bickering to each other.The title of the movie is 'A
Walk in the Woods' but maybe a more appropriate title would be
'Stumbling through the Parking Lot'. All of Bryson's rich and moving
commentary about the history of environmental thought in America is
summed up with an offhand comment by Redford about a tree.The dialogue and writing is almost entirely composed of tired clichés
that I feel like I've seen better in a thousand other films. Kwapis
forced the theme of dealing with regrets in later life and having one
last adventure before buying the farm. What he ends up with is a few
painfully awkward scenes between Redford and Mary Steenburgen as Bryson
considers having an affair on his wife (played by Emma Thompson).
Nolte's Katz later tries to pick up a woman in the laundromat and the
intrepid hikers must escape out a window, just as the audience ponders
escaping the theater.The poor writing and forced jokes are almost unbearable; an opinion
apparently shared by the cast of the film, as none of them seemed to
want to be there. This leaves the audience to watch stiff, awkward, and
disjointed performances from the otherwise talented actors. Redford's
Bryson comes across as elitist, judgmental, and boring. While Nolte's
Katz is indescribably hard to watch; hobbling along the trail at an
improbable pace given his many supposed ailments and gargling out
enough F-bombs as to make the dialogue seem lopsided. Thompson almost
seems embarrassed to be in the three scenes in which she appears.It is unclear as to the intended audience for this movie. Instead of
making a movie that fans of the book would love, Kwapis made a cheesy
drama that I would feel is insulting to fans of the book, all hikers
and outdoor enthusiasts, and the elderly community in general. The best
parts of the book were removed and replaced with unnecessary drama,
dumb jokes that don't even qualify as slapstick, and a hopeless feeling
that Bryson and Katz are hiking not towards a better friendship and an
appreciation for nature, but towards their failure and regret laden
graves.Overall, this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Reading the
book inspired me to hike the Appalachian Trail so I could be a part of
American history and gain a better appreciation of the natural world.
Watching the movie inspired me to hike the Appalachian Trail so I could
get as far away from the movie as possible.",104,2015

of our lives we'll never get back.What seems initially like a good premise with unlimited possibilities
it is transformed in a lame and boring Carpenter-ish c-class movie that
leads nowhere.Sometimes after a slow boring movie you might get a rewarding and
interesting ending, so your time spend not to feel wasted.Unfortunately this is not the case here. The ending is as ambiguous as
it could possibly be.I call this type of movies ""The 3 minutes more movies"" and includes
other crappy ones like ""Another Earth"". What do I mean by that 3
minutes more? I mean movies that the ending would be crystal clear if
the movie lasted 3 minutes more (or at least one in this case). What
happened really is a mystery only for the audience who feels cheated.
The crew of the simulation will know the truth soon enough. The
audience never will. It's not an ending to interpret or to start a
conversation about it. It's just like they ran out of film a couple of
minutes sort before the actual ending.The cast consists of likable actors including Brandon (Superman
Returns) Routh but were misused. The production soon feels cheap and
the pace is boring. Initially you expect something to happen but soon
enough you give up and just wait for the conclusion which in this

1781,11.0,6.7,"A very nice person suggested me to transcribe, what I actually wrote on
boards about this movie, as a review, so here we go. In the first
place, I decided that this movie became one of my all-time
favourites... and why is that I 'decided'? Because the more I thought
of this movie after watching it, the more I liked it. And what I mean
by that is, the main reason I loved this film, would probably be
because of the feeling it generated on me. It felt like I was reading a
book, an actual & good one, you know, because of its twists, its
dramatic scenes and the complexity of its characters & emotions. I liked the way it explores human emotions and relationships but
centered in a darker side, let's just say. The dichotomy showed was so
well made. It was all so real and so unreal at the same time. Besides,
it certainly shows us the thin line that exists between desire and
obsession. PLUS, the fact that such things are still going on nowadays,
which makes it very realistic. Even though I do know this movie is in fact based on a book, I can't
really comment from that perspective since I didn't read it, but anyway
that's not my point here... The way I see it, In my opinion, this film
is so smart, intriguing, fascinating and so beautifully executed that
not only will stay with you long afterwards but also will make you
talk, comment about it with others, you know, and that's just simply
the kind of movie I love to watch but unfortunately, there aren't
enough films like this. In addition to that: The cinematography was just... breathtaking. The
locations... esthetically pleasing. The soundtrack... impeccable. The
wardrobe... simply gorgeous. And well, what to say about the actings? They were just... impressive,
top-notch, especially Eva Green's one, which was jaw-dropping. She
literally gave me the chills with her performance. She left me
fascinated. That being said, Jordan Scott you are (ei) genius! Needless
to say, I'm looking forward to see more of your work.",104,2009
1782,9.75,6.1,"Considering the critical drubbing this movie received, not to mention the
fact that it's by the writer/director of Two Days in the Valley, I expected
it to be pretty terrible. Surprisingly it turned out to be an exciting and
occasionally quite funny thriller about two media obsessed thugs from the
former Soviet Union who decide to become celebrities by committing a series
of murders and videotaping the crimes. The movie is definitely not without
serious flaws: for instance, nobody ever points out that it's almost
impossible to mount a successful insanity defense in the US legal system.
In a land where Jeffrey Dahmer and New York's highly delusional subway
shooter are certified as sane these guys wouldn't have a shot in hell of
making their case, and an insanity defence is the linchpin of their whole
plan to profit from their crimes. Movie also ignores the fact that laws
have been on the books to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes
by selling their stories since the 1960's. Also, given the legal and
ethical ramifications involved it's hard to imagine any credible scenario
under which a news program, even a sleazy tabloid news program, would pay a
million dollars cash to an at large murderer for a videotape of one of his
crimes and then broadcast the thing live on television. Obvious flaws
aside, 15 Minutes has several shockingly well-staged action sequences, great
acting (except for the guy who played Ed Burns' boss--his grating one note
performance went way over the self-parody line) and occasional welcome
touches of black humor, like the very funny death scene of the thug who
fancied himself a film director and manufactures the final shot of his movie
for maximum emotional impact. All in all 15 Minutes is a dark and funny

seemed to be trying to overcompensate for other flaws but on the plus
side the camera work was good.I'm giving it a 4 because it's a useful film for would be movie makers.I'd be interested to know what the actual budget was and how long it
took to film but it is clearly a very constrained budget film if you
managed to stay watching until the end credits they were all covered in
around one page with less than 10 people involved, in many movies these
days you have 10 minutes of credits.For 90% of the film it was two characters in a single setting and they

It's not a horror movie, for those going into it expecting it to be.
The backbone of it is a murder mystery but there are supernatural
elements added to it, as well as a good bit of humor. The mystery part
isn't the greatest. I figured out who the killer was immediately with
little effort. I can only imagine most other viewers will, as well. But
the other stuff with the horns and the way they make people act
provides for some nice dark comedy. I was impressed with Daniel
Radcliffe, although he needs to keep working on his accent. His
pronunciation is a little too pointed at times. Juno Temple is always
great to watch. Wish she was in this more. The rest of the cast is
solid. Nice to see Heather Graham in a small but fun role. It's a good

1786,10.333333333333334,5.3,"""12 Rounds 3: Lockdown"" deserved a much better script. As a mindless
action flick, it's not a bad way to spend ninety minutes. Production
values are adequate and there are some decent action sequences. The
unarmed combat scenes are much better than the gunfights. The somewhat
gratuitous car scenes seem more like product placements than part of
the script. The script makes no sense at all. Why would a police department even
have a lockdown mode that prevents fire doors from opening from the
inside? Why would the villains think they could hunt down and murder an
officer when every corner of the building is monitored by security
cameras? The villains operate as if there is no forensic evidence of
anything, even the caliber of weapons. The script tries to give Shaw (Ambrose) a backstory and inner conflict
with an incident that resulted in a partner's death and required an
extended leave for psychiatric care. Several characters refer to the
incident; however, there is never any resolution. We expect to find out
that either it wasn't really his fault due to circumstances he didn't
understand, as in ""Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol"" or to learn
that some character fault or error in judgment did result in the death
and that he can overcome a similar dilemma only if he has learned from
the experience. But it is never developed and his experience doesn't
seem to infuse his actions. Shaw also has history with the villain, but
neither seems to use any unique understanding of the other to any
advantage. ""12 Rounds"" and ""12 Rounds 2: Reloaded"" have been compared to ""Die Hard
with a Vengeance,"" while ""12 Rounds 3: Lockdown"" has been compared to
the original ""Die Hard."" However, where the first two 12 Rounds films
had clever scripts that compared favorably with the second Die Hard,
the third pales compared to the original ""Die Hard."" Long segments without dialogue require actors of the caliber of Bruce
Willis (""Die Hard""), Robert Redford (""All is Lost"") and Tom Hanks
(""Castaway""). Dean Ambrose can be effective when given the material. An
early scene at a stoplight is effective without dialogue.
Unfortunately, he's not given much to work with. Shaw frequently ejects his magazine to count the number of bullets
remaining, but never adds in one for the bullet in the chamber. The
villains are able to get into the armory and equip themselves with
assault rifles and bulletproof vests, but Shaw can't manage to pick up
one of the weapons dropped during a fight. There is no character development and no moral. Shaw has inner demons,
but seems to ignore them. He is wounded, but ignores the wounds. He has
an opportunity to team up with another cop, but doesn't. The script is a largely predictable mishmash of familiar tropes. The
level of gunplay is over the top. There is no way the villains could
hope to argue that their use of force was justified by the
circumstances or that the top brass would allow them to continue
shooting up the department with wild abandon. And yet, the tone is very
serious and down to earth, unlike such films as ""Shoot 'Em Up"" or
""Smokin' Aces,"" which have a comic book sense of reality. While the film never really engages the viewer, neither does it bore.
While the plot seems ridiculous and implausible, if one can disengage
ones mental faculties, it offers some entertaining action sequences.",90,2015
1787,4.666666666666667,7.2,"Recent films set in the 1950s, such as 'Pleasantville', 'Far from
Heaven' and 'Mona Lisa Smile' have tended to portray the decade as
being a repressed, overly conservative period. A generation ago,
however, the tendency was to take a more sympathetic, nostalgic look at
the fifties in films such as 'Grease' or television programmes such as
'Happy Days'. The post-Vietnam generation seemed to look back at the
period immediately before that war as a lost age of innocence. 'Diner' follows a group of young men from Baltimore, former school
friends now in their early twenties, over a week of their lives, that
between Christmas Eve and New Year, 1959. Some of them are still living
and working in the town, others are now at college, but are using the
Christmas vacation as a chance to get back together with old friends.
The title is taken from the diner that is their favourite
meeting-place. There is no real coherent plot; the film is very
episodic in structure and concentrates on character rather than on
action. As is perhaps inevitable with young men of this age, many of their
preoccupations are with girls and relationships. One of them, Shrevie,
is married, but seems to be discontented with married life. Another,
Eddie, is engaged. A third, Billy, discovers during the course of the
film that he has got his girlfriend pregnant, but when he offers to do
the decent thing by her, he is disconcerted to realize that she would
much rather he did the indecent one. A fourth, Boogie, seems to lead a
carefree life, flitting from one romance to another. The characters are
not, however, preoccupied with love and sex to the exclusion of all
else. We also learn about their other private obsessions with such
matters as music, sport and the cinema. Shrevie quarrels with his wife
because she does not share his passion for popular music and fails to
understand his complex system for cataloguing his extensive record
collection. (I wonder if this scene was the origin of a similarly
obsessive character in 'High Fidelity'). Eddie's passion for sport is
even more all-consuming than Shrevie's for music; he subjects his
fiancée Elyse to a football quiz and threatens to break off the
engagement if she cannot score a sufficiently high score. A minor
character knows off by heart the entire dialogue from the film 'Sweet
Smell of Success'.Many of the young actors who starred in the film have gone on to become
famous names in the movie world. From my point of view the best was
probably Kevin Bacon as Timothy, the rebel without a cause who has
dropped out of his wealthy family and lives an aimless life. (The first
time we see him he is smashing windows just for the hell of it). I was,
however, also impressed by Daniel Stern as Shrevie and Mickey Rourke as
Boogie. I have never been to Baltimore, but it was clear from watching the film
that the director was trying to capture the spirit of a particular
place and time. It therefore came as no surprise to discover that Barry
Levinson, who both wrote and directed the film, is himself a Baltimore
native, although slightly younger than the characters depicted in the
film. (He would have been seventeen in 1959). Despite this
concentration on the particular, however, 'Diner' has a universal
appeal. The film with which it has most in common is 'American
Graffiti'. Although that film was actually set in the early sixties
rather than the fifties, it nevertheless deals quite openly with the
idea of the pre-Vietnam era as a golden age. 'Diner' does not deal with
this theme so overtly, but there is still nevertheless a distinct sense
of an era coming to an end. It is significantly set in the final week
of a decade, and in the wedding scene we see a large banner saying
'Eddie and Elyse- in the sixties and forever', a reminder that change
is on the way, both for these young men and for America as a whole. The most important change that the characters in 'Diner' have to come
to terms with is neither social nor political, but rather the challenge
of growing up. The traditional 'Coming of Age' film has tended to
concentrate on adolescence and the teenage years. For many young men,
however, their early twenties, when they are completing or have already
completed their education, are setting out on their careers and are
starting to think about more serious relationships with women, can be a
time of even greater changes than their days in secondary school. All
the major characters- except perhaps the serious-minded Billy who is
keen to accept new responsibilities- want to hang on to elements of
their boyhood even while moving into adulthood. For Boogie, and, to an even greater degree, Timothy, this means keeping
the freedom to be irresponsible. For Shrevie and Eddie, this means
trying to keep hold of their youthful passions even after marriage. The
discord between Shrevie and his wife (slightly older than him and
considerably more mature in outlook) is caused as much by his fear that
marriage will mean having to give up his association with his old
friends as by her inability to differentiate between jazz and
rock-and-roll. Barry Levinson's claim that Elyse's football test was
based on a true incident may seem improbable, but there is some
psychological truth in this part of the film. It has, after all, been
said that every man's ideal woman is himself incarnated in the body of
a beautiful girl, and Elyse's willingness to take this test shows that
she is prepared to make sacrifices and enter into Eddie's male-oriented
world. 'Diner' is a film worth seeing more than once. On my first viewing I
found it dull, an inferior copy of 'American Graffiti'. The second time
round, I started to appreciate it as a fine film in its own right.
Barry Levinson has gone on to make a number of other good films ('The
Natural', 'Good Morning Vietnam', 'Rain Man' and 'Sleepers'), but
'Diner', his first film, is perhaps his most personal and heartfelt.

stars) of this film - he just didn't ""get it."" This character driven
murder
mystery is one of the decade's best! Definitely four stars!The layered conflicts drive the story forward like a Mack truck careening
down the side of a mountain, making the movie seem much shorter than its
130
minutes. Kevin Spacey's compelling portrayal of David Gale, a brilliant,
principled man with more than his share of human flaws and bad luck, is
excellent and is surely Oscar material.The story begins four days before Gale's execution in a Texas prison.
Gale
is finally breaking his years of silence by agreeing to tell his side of
the
story to news-magazine reporter, Bitsey Bloom. Skeptical that this Death
Row
inmate is out to convince her, and the world, of his innocence, Bitsey
takes
the assignment expecting it to be a typical, no-brainer.Gale's story is told in a series of tightly choreographed flashback
sequences, each building in character, motive and momentum toward an
exciting and most unexpected conclusion.The story also puts a very fine point on the debate over the death penalty
and gives its audience something to talk & think about on the way home.Not since ""Presumed Innocent"" have I been so deliciously unable to predict
an ending! It is a pleasure to leave the theater feeling completely happy

it is only rated 5 on IMDb, but this should definitely be rated a 7 or
higher. All I have to say is that this has an original story and it
does portray a crude truth about the world we live in.This is a rely good way to spend your evening if you want to watch
something mind-blowing. The movie is not at all predictable, the acting
is beyond perfect, it actually makes you think this is an X-Files movie

movies of recent times.From the beginning,your eyes remain glued to the
screen.The historic match between Spassky and Fisher has been depicted
so vividly, that at times you forget that you are watching a
movie.Tobey Maguire has been criticized a lot for his portrayal of the
legendary chess player.But I found him too good.His acting was as
intense as this movie.The frowning, the clenching, the swing of mood
everything was made so much believable.Liev Shreiber, too has done a

but I considered it to be better than okay because it was actually
realistic. It definitely shows an accurate representation of how the
police handle harassment, the officer even states in the movie ""I am
doing everything I can within the law."" Carter is shown to have pretty
decent hacking skills, but that is explained earlier in the movie when
he said he was an IT Tech, so that's not something just random and out
of the blue. Out of all of the endings possible for this movie, I
believe they chose the best one they could that was still realistic.
There was nothing glaringly obvious that was unrealistic besides the
fact that Leah took all of the necessary precautions such as getting a
restraining order and changing her number, but she somehow forgot about
the spare key. I don't want to bag too heavily on that though, because
we all honestly forget something important at one point or another.
Overall, the realism was spot on.It had its tear-jerkers and jump scares at a few points, but overall it
was suspenseful and definitely a thriller, however, this isn't
necessarily a movie that you will be on the edge of your seat waiting
for what is going to happen next since everything happening is in plain
sight. But even if you are able to see everything happening, each event

some enjoyment in We Are Your Friends. I'm not too big on EDM; I love
some of it, dislike most of it, but this movie actually painted the
genre/scene in an interesting light. They add a human element to the
otherwise processed and compressed music, and it's pretty captivating.
At least those scenes are. Where the movie fails can be attributed to
its title. We Are Your Friends shouldn't have been about friendship or
having each others backs or whatever they were trying to go for because
that is by far the weakest element of the movie. Zac Efron is great in
the lead role, but his friends are complete throwaway characters. I
didn't care about any of them. There is one scene near the end where
the friend arc almost pays off, but even then it's not worth all the
wasted minutes building up these characters when there's a far more
interesting story that's going to waste.The story I'm referring to involves Wes Bentley's character James who
is a washed up DJ that kind of fell from grace and is now living off
royalty checks and he ends up being the person who teaches Cole (Efron)
how to make electronic music effective. I really enjoyed Bentley in
this role. In fact, the whole trifecta of Efron, Bentley, and Emily
Ratajkowski is what made the movie watchable. Bentley being the mentor
character who is fighting a lot of inner demons, Efron being the
ambitious musician who is hungry for his big break, and Ratajkowski
showing off her acting talent as the assistant/girlfriend to Bentley's
character who ends up falling for Efron. Even though it sounds like a
cliché love triangle, for some reason it works. There's tension between
these characters - you care about the friendship between James and
Cole, but you also recognize their faults and why Emily's character is
torn in her position. They make for some pretty powerful scenes.But again, this potential is muddled underneath a bunch of Hollywood
crap. There's a throwaway plot about the gang working for a real estate
agency, there's an attempt at a moral to being true to yourself in
order to make it big, there is just a bunch of predictable nonsense
that clutters this film which is a shame. Believe me, I was not
expecting to have any nice things to say about We Are Your Friends, but
there is definitely something here. The fact is that the goodness in

Pan story, sadly the foundation doesn't have much on it and what's
there is shaky.The main issue I had with this film is that it seemed like it couldn't
make up it's mind on whether it wanted to cater to children with goofy
and antic like behavior from the characters, or offer up serious and
gritty story telling for the adults. It flip flops from one to the
other from scene to scene and it's very noticeable. The incredibly
cringe-worthy use of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" in the Neverland
introduction scene represents my point the best.I wondered all throughout the movie why they had given James Hook an
American Accent, I have seen other reviews say that it seemed like the
Director/Writer wanted Garret Hedlund to channel some Indiana Jones for
this role. They are right, but I am baffled as to why the Production
wanted him too. It makes no sense for what we know he will eventually
become.This movie isn't ALL bad, however. Levi Miller as Pan is a lot better
than I ever expected him to be, the kid has some talent and it's going
to be interesting to see how he develops as an actor if he sticks with
it. Rooney Mara puts in a great effort as Tiger Lily too. Hugh Jackman
tries REALLY hard to lift this movie. He is easily the top performance
with his Blackbeard and it was easy to see that he enjoyed the freedom
of the character. In fact, they should get Jackman to play Hook in the
next movie. He'd be brilliant.Shout out to Adeel Akhtar as Mr. Smee. Outside of Jackman he gets the
most laughs in the film and was a great casting choice.If you have kids then take them to see it, they will like it but be
prepared because you probably won't.",111,2015

he's European and will charm them with an accent then deliver absolute
failure.Avoid this movie, it's a prime example as to why so many people are

that, or I seriously don't understand the way it's supposed to be.
However, if you do watch The Shortcut expecting a 5.0 rated film -
you'll be very pleasantly surprised.The way I see it, this film is divided into three parts. The first one
is the longest and slowest, giving us the exposition and buildup which
are quite good - family moves into a new place, the kids in school and
their friends, the local urban legend of a place you shouldn't go to,
the works! The second part starts about an hour after the beginning,
involves a pretty nice twist and is much more fast-paced, with some cat
and mouse chases just like in Slasher films. The final part is the
ending, which completely blew my head off as I did not see it coming! I
thought the film was above average but not by far, and then the ending
really got it some more points.The acting is good, especially by Shannon Woodward as Lisa. The flashes
from earlier years were also well used, and the cinematography wasn't

about Christianity or atheism and I have not read the book nor do I
know who the guys directing the movie are, so my opinion of this movie
is based only in what I did see on the screen.And it was alright. Nothing special about this film, really. It's kinda
like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre without any gore. People stuck in a
house, people running around scared. A bogeyman, the occupants are
weirdos etc. So you have seen this before if you're a horror fan. And
even if you're not you still seen this before. I have to admit that I
did not miss the gore, so the movie delivers somewhat without the gore.What comes to the actors, it was a mixed mess. Some scenes were good
and then some were so silly or so out of this world that you just had
to cringe. I have to admit that I only stumbled to this movie because
of Michael Madsen. And well, he is always gooood. At acting I mean.All in all, this is nothing new. If it is a rainy day, you could rent
this. But if you really dig horror you might as well rent something
better. Like old-school classic ""The Haunting"" which is really a HORROR
movie. This movie here is horror only for those who don't watch horror

special or it has some deeper meaning, well haha to you sir. It has

what it meant to the music world in general.There's also a surprising amount of footage of them before they donned
the robot outfits. I was expecting maybe a couple of photos, but you
get videos from concerts and similar. They've also seemed to track
don't the audio interviews they could, which is good for those of us
who don't speak French.That said, they have made some odd choices in what the prioritized. The
Tron-soundtrack is barely given any attention at all, and there seems
to be quite a lot of interviews with famous people that offer little
new about Daft Punk. I'm fine with some of that, but here there were
perhaps a little too much. Also how people they've been with in their
career are used as headlines for parts of the documentary - I don't

good performances by Rex Harrison, Clift Robertson, Susan Hayward,
Capucine, Edie Adams, and Maggie Smith. The script and direction of
Joseph Mankiewicz were perfect. But it flopped, possibly because the
times did not call for a literate murder mystery film.It's lineage is impeccable since it begins with Ben Jonson's classic
Jacobean comedy ""Volpone"". But actually it is not ""Volpone"". The film
is based on Thomas Sterling's ""The Evil of the Day"". The story has been
changed in one way. Sterling's novel brings together three would-be
heirs too, but two are men, and one is Fox's wife (as in the movie -
Susan Hayward's role). But the same plot switches go on in the novel as
in this film.I enjoyed the movie, in particular one moment that was rare to see in
any film of that period. Harrison has invited his three would-be heirs
to come to dinner. Hayward (accompanied by her secretary Smith) comes
in first. While they are talking to Harrison and Robertson, both Adams
and Capucine show up at the doorway. Neither is willing to let the
other go in first. They end up pushing into each other through the door

budget, and amateur attempt for Netflix to get bigger in their original
film business. I went to IMDb to see what people had to say, noticed it
got decent reviews and decided to give it a shot. Let me say, this is
one of the best films I have ever seen within this genre.Without spoiling anything, I will say that this is about the general
civil warfare that exists in Africa, something most western, shelterd
Americans have never even fathomed and have only learned about through
movies. The film doesn't specify what part of Africa it is, but you
know it is something that is real.Netflix doesn't hide anything about the realities of what happens to
families, children, fathers, and brothers, as well as the numbness the
war leaders (on both sides, really) have toward excessive and brutal
violence. Imagine: the film shows all of this through the eyes of a
boy, probably only 12 years old. He is forced into a mercenary squad
after his family is torn apart, and he experiences something that is
even darker than hell itself.That young boy, played by Abraham Attah, puts on a performance I have
never seen before in a child actor. Given the mature content of the
film, it is quite unbelievable that the torn emotions any child would
have, given this situation, is so clearly displayed and authentic.
Every scene just tore at my soul; I wondered if it was really acting.
And he wasn't the only one; women, children, and the ""extras"" in the
film: are these people really doing their first major film? Each scene
left me speechless.The emotional involvement I had with this film as a viewer is
astonishing. I felt ashamed at myself for thinking my life had
problems, for thinking my life was hard. I felt foolish realizing my
immaturity in life, and felt embarrassed for us as America in general,
for caring so much about things so materialistic and shallow, when
people in Africa (and other parts of the world, no doubt), are fighting
for their lives every day, being torn apart by corrupt leaders and
greed.To compare this film, it is similar to The City of God and Blood

beaches, we've even seen sharks in a God damn tornado not once, but 4
times. And now, we have Sharks in a lake? Shark Lake is a Dolph
Lundgren B movie that fails in every single way you can possibly
imagine. Now, where to begin? Firstly, the film is really dumb and
cringe worthy, and not in a fun way. For example, this character called
Peter is introduced to us as a guy with a PhD... Yet he has to ask the
lead is they are a cop when they are IN UNIFORM WITH A PATCH ON HER
SHOLUDER SAYING ""SHERRIFF DEPT"". That is just one of the many straight
up idiotic moments in this terrible movie.This film is unintentionally funny in everything it attempts. Whether
its is the sheer patheticness of the old lady at the first attack, or
the jet ski collision from outta nowhere, or every moment the shark is
on screen. There is one shot I found hilarious where the camera has a
birds eye view of the water as if to show how big the killer shark
is.... And then this tiny little shark silhouette appears under the
water. My god this film is funny for all the wrong reasons.Being a B movie, the film isn't going to have a lot of money to work
with, and you really feel it in this film. The sound is poor as well as
the lighting at times. Some scenes are too dark and the police lights
at the start of the film are so intense, they could possibly trigger an
epileptic fit. But I'm not a doctor so don't take my word on that. The
film also doesn't contain Dolph Lundgren much at all. It's not that its
a bad thing, it's just that the films lead just doesn't do anything in
this film and is almost misleading if you think you are going to get 90
minutes of Dolph vs Shark because you get about 2 minutes probably. But
wait there's more, the script is also bad. The characters aren't
likable, for example the real lead in this film, Hernandez, is a
terrible cop and a finger pointer when it comes to blame (well only to
Dolph Lundgren).Speacking of a terrible script, Dolph 's story with the mob boss guy
gets completely forgotten about. The guy more or less comes in and says
""get my shark or my money or I kill you daughter"" and the next time you
see him is in the back of some car ( A police car? I don't know the
framing didn't reveal that) and Dolph makes a comment and boom its all
happily ever after... It's like the writers literally forgot about this
part of the story and so squeezed it into the ending. Like seriously?Overall, Shark Lake is a unintentionally hilarious Dolph Lundgren B
movie. The film is of the quality you would expect of B, C, D all the
way through to Z movies. One thing still bugs me about this film...
What is the third thing that all living things do? Like, Peter with the
Phd says there are 3 things... And then only lists 2 things... So
what's the third thing? Anyway this film is not good and I don't know
what the point was with it. Porr Dolph is left swimming with the fishes

the screening, and one I encouraged friends and associates to check
out. Some still haven't forgiven me.Imagine the combination of dread/anticipation I felt about the chance
to see director Ben Wheatley's latest slice of darkness entitled
""Sightseers"". Described by some as a ""dark comedy"", I would say that
the only thing possibly darker than Wheatley's sense of humor would be
the center of a black hole.""Sightseers"" tells the story of a frumpy British couple off on
'holiday' (as they say,) the problems that come up on such trips, and
the unique way they choose to solve them. Saying any more would give
too much away. Suffice it to say, may you NEVER come across a couple
like this on your vacation.Is it funny? Yes, it is. But you may hate yourself for laughing. Is it
violent? For sure. Exceptionally. But in the context of the story, it
has to be. Is it disturbing? Oh, yes it is, but once again Wheatley has
made a film that once you've started it, you'll find it difficult to
turn away. And, like ""Kill List"", the ending packs a wallop from which
it may take you a while to recover.Films like ""Sightseers"" are tough to categorize, and even tougher to
recommend. This is not the feel-good hit of the summer. It is a look
into the blackest parts of human nature, and how that blackness is
often camouflaged by the banality of everyday existence. I wouldn't
call Wheatley's films ""entertaining"", but damned if they don't get an
emotional response out of me. So seek it out but you have been warned.www.worstshowontheweb.com",88,2012

This is followed by her shocked father-in-law's remark ""no matter how
you look at it, that woman is a witch!"" To which his son replies ""no
matter how you spell it either."" A good example of some of the clever
(not to mention funny) pseudo-profanity and ""no-no"" innuendo script
writers had to develop back then.As usual, Windsor plays her part to the hilt and makes a very credible
villain. Unfortunately, the script writers went overboard with her
character, almost making her a caricature of herself. They exaggerate
her ""W"" or ""B""ness to such a degree that it becomes unrealistic and
even comical. What self-respecting cold, calculating gold-digger would
publicly commit adultery with her secretary's fiancée before she was
done squeezing her husband? Windsor herself seems to display an inner
grin even with her nastiest facial expressions. She no doubt realized
how ridiculous some of the script was. In the movie, she owns and lives
in an art gallery. Since the real Marie Windsor was a multi-talented
individual who achieved some success as a painter and sculptress, I
wonder if this is simply coincidental.I guess one purpose served by making her such a larger than life meanie
is to make all the suspects seem equally likely to have killed her.A mix of true ""noir"" and standard ""whodunit"" hurt by overdone
melodramatics, yet still worth seeing.",70,1955
1814,5.333333333333333,6.7,"Heavy Traffic is, like many of Ralph Bakshi's films, a like it or hate
it affair, but for those that respond to it, the film provides many a
surprising attack on sensibility, decency, and what it means to get by
in urban sprawl. It's almost too personal; one can see Bakshi or
friends of his having gone through some of the little things in the
lower ranks of New York City's daily life (particularly Brooklyn life)
as depicted here. But it's this connection to a personal reality- and
then a TOTAL adherence to turning this reality on its head and making
it as wild, violent, and sexually deviant as possible- that is the key
to the success of Bakshi's film, the best of his I've seen so far. His
main character, Michael, is probably loosely based on himself; a young,
would-be underground cartoonist who lives with insanely irate parents
(Italian father and Jewish mother), and interacts with the neighborhood
he's in with a casual attitude and a little reluctance to join in the
mayhem that goes on with such kooky cats. Enter in Carole, a black
bartender who won't take s*** from anyone, who teams up as a business
partner, more or less, with Michael to first get cartoons off the
ground, then, so it goes, misadventures in prostitution. It all leads
up to an ending that isn't expected, though a sort of double-piling of
shock and pleasant surprise.Heavy Traffic outlays Bakshi's outlook on life in a skill that could be
called animated exploitation film-making. However, it's through this
overloading of characters *meant* to be unattractive, sexually piggish,
wretchedly racist (and, on the other side of the coin, sexist), and
violent in the tradition of the Looney Tunes cartoons with the worst
taste, that the film gets to the guts of the matter. It's a
half-embrace, half-attack on a lack of values in a society, and as
Baskhi relishes in his excess, he also is criticizing both himself for
lapping it up and those in the neighborhood for being such eccentric
mother-f***ers. And, as a satire should be, it's very funny,
occasionally uproariously so. Scenes like Michael being pressured to
get it on with the girl on the mattress on the roof, and the outcome as
a sort of running gag; the scene with the song Mabeline playing, as
Baskhi puts out drawings that are without much color, and look
incredible for the reason that there's seemingly little effort put into
the animation with the random over-the-top sexual positions; the little
bits in the feuding with Michael's parents, the mother with her
Jewish-star knife-holster and the father with his dedication to the
""Godfather"", who eats little people in his pasta, over anything really
with his family; and when Michael presents ""religious"" cartoons to a
dying old man, which to any prurient Christian taste is hilariously
offensive and, well, cool.Bakshi is so personal at times, with his taste in color schemes, in
over-lapping images with film clips, combining live-action and
animation (usually with dancing ladies on one side and a lurid little
twerp gawking on the other), and even likely real family photos from
his own family laid in, that it levels going too far. There's a
tendency for self-indulgence, however not always the bad kind, if that
makes sense, and one can see how the film can and has been vehemently
criticized for what it is really trying to criticize in the film. But
deep down, past the creative madman in Bakshi, is also a heart; his
film ends on a touching note, as abstraction turns real and a totally
live scene reveals another level to Michael and Carol, as real outcasts
who are both totally stubborn, and somehow meant for each other. Heavy
Traffic is a one-of-a-kind affair, and the kind of under-the-radar act
of an outrageous spectacle that it could only be done in the 70s.

ways - seeing the mother as impossibly overbearing and interfering.Actually mother and son have a great relationship. They argue intensely

most of us should be so lucky to have such a relationship. So she takes it too far - but hardly in a Tennessee Williams way. And
they argue intensely about that too, and work their way to a successful
conclusion.Sure, it's all a little too Hollywood pat and neat in the end.But you have an unusual portrait of an unusual and very good mother-son

do anything to fulfill his duty as a town sheriff and bring the
criminals to justice. Williams--A loving husband who would do anything
to bring his love back even in the face of immense odds.There are some scenes in this movie which will definitely shock you
being so gory and violent and this is coming from me being a long time

blessings in my life but I was particularly moved by this one since it

believe, as some do, that the end was any worse than the rest of it.
It's consistent with the rest.The directing and production quality is lacking. It's good enough, but

gags, but seek a more deep/meaningful humor.It's not a ""feel-good"" movie, it's not a provocative movie, it's not a

death initiated by a sorority entitled ""Dead on Campus.It stars Katelyn

by Curtis Crawford tells the story of Natalie and the death of a guy
that he dated that was caused by the sorority.Natalie was a smart and intelligent College student.When she caught her
boyfriend sleeping with another in an act,she decided to transfer to
another university.In her transfer,she decided to join a new sorority
and to undergo the initiation rites that she had to go to.Among them is
to seduce a guy named Sumner who is known to be shy and
introvert.During their date,the sorority members decide to go on a
prank that became viral.This led to the guy to commit suicide.The
sister of Sumner,who happens to work in the university as an
administrator,believes that there was something fishy behind her
brother's death.She think that he was murdered instead of suicide and
points all her fingers towards Natalie. This prompted Natalie to
investigate the case herself to find the culprits and to clear her
name.Obviously,this screenplay of the protagonist trying to investigate the
case for themselves to clear their guilt has been used many times

particularly amazing, with fast, witty exchanges filled with little
jokes. Yet, the movie vacillates from hilarity to melancholy without
warning the viewer, which makes the film all the more special.The depiction of and commentary on NYC, youth, etc. is all spot on,
making this movie worth the watch.Finally, the soundtrack is excellent too, giving the movie a very

overreacting about a family tradition of a Christmas star, is upset
that they won't do the star tradition since they're going to the kid's

important the Christmas tree star is. Than, Bob justs says that the
star is important, and that was about it. And after that, Amy goes into
Gabe's room, seeing he is playing his Christmas present. She doesn't
immediately ask him why he is playing it, and than she says, ""Gabe""?
But he doesn't listen. Than, Amy says that a few more times, but he
still doesn't listen. And after that, she blocks his screen. Than some

is. Why don't I tell everyone? In fact, why don't I call strangers and
tell them?"" And she is pleased with him, and than Gabe asks if he can
take his game system with him. And Amy says no, and than she walks out
of the room. Than he says (oh gosh I am going to hate myself typing in
this curse word) and he whispers, ""Damn it!"" SERIOUSLY? How, and why?

1828,7.0,7.6,"Described by nme.com as ""a four string demon"", Jaco Pastorius was
arguably the greatest electric bass guitarist to walk the earth since
John Entwistle, and continues to hold a revered reputation amongst
bassists across the world, including me. The news of a documentary and
the release of the film's theatrical trailer tickled my anticipation to
high levels, and I can proudly say that Robert Trujillo's 2015 passion
project is a great representation of Jaco's career and personal life.Although normal moviegoers might not appreciate Jaco as a film, it
should not be viewed as a mind-boggling piece of cinema, but rather a
detailed lesson on one of the most influential musicians of all time.
The essential purpose of a documentary is to educate the masses on a
subject not commonly known. Jaco more than delivers as a refresher for
fans and as a discovery for newcomers. It touches on most of the
essential topics in Jaco's life: his youth, musical career, personal
life, mental disorders, and most importantly, his legacy in the musical
community. This intriguing and deeply personal story is represented
through a wide variety of media, including photos, archive footage,
interviews, and music. You might question the over-reliance on grainy
Super 8 footage, but it nonetheless provides us to hours of unseen
footage and concerts, showing that the filmmakers have really done
their homework and respect the material they are handling. As far as
their production values go, the style of the titles and montages is
gorgeous and oozing with colour, while the high resolution, low
depth-of-field shots showcase a level of professionalism for the most
part.Jaco features dozens of famous musicians that offer words on this
kingpin of the electric bass, including Flea, Joni Mitchell, Herbie
Hancock and many more. Although the filmmakers fail to capitalise on
the big-name bassists, such as Sting, Bootsy Collins, Geddy Lee and
Victor Wooten, the undeniable influence of Jaco reverentially
acknowledged by these musicians is humbling to listen to, propelling
your appreciation of him even further. Moreover, the people who were
most important in Jaco's life and/or those who knew him best are given
longer amounts of screen time, and rightly so; the raw authenticity
with which they describe Jaco and his demise propel the emotion of the
film.No discussion of Jaco would be complete without mentioning its
soundtrack, primarily (and appropriately) comprised of music composed
and performed by Jaco himself. While the occasional leitmotifs from the
soprano saxophone and the bass guitar harmonics feel a bit too
monotonous, it is a very small complaint, because the symphonic-like
arrangement of Jaco's countless compositions throughout the film is so
intelligent and mathematical, and it is impossible not to feel chills
when you hear the deus-like virtuosity of Jaco's playing.
Coincidentally, the best Jaco compositions are the ones that are
utilised the best in the film, such as Continuum, Portrait of Tracy,
Donna Lee and Come On, Come Over, all of which happen to be from his
eponymous debut album.We might view films as a means of escape and entertainment, but the
really good ones are ones that manage to both distract and educate us.
Jaco perfectly achieves both of these objectives, and while it is not
as jaw-dropping as Whiplash, it is the perfect medium to transform
anyone into a fan of Jaco Pastorius, a unique, tormented and
unforgettable individual who reinvented the electric bass the same way
Jimi Hendrix did with the guitar.",110,2015
1829,9.5,6.0,"To be honest, I absolutely love trash like this! Maniac Cop is a film
that clearly isn't too caught up with trying to establish itself
alongside the more professional efforts of the horror genre, and
instead simply revels in it's B-movie status. This gives the film free
reign to do whatever it wants to do, as it doesn't have to worry about
coherency or logic and this helps it massively as the final result
shows. Actually, surprisingly enough; this is a rather professionally
handled B-movie and many of the reasons why it works are down to things
like atmosphere and characters, which are the things that the film
isn't supposed to be bothered about. The plot is well worked also, and
the way that the mystery pans out is exciting in all the right places.
The story follows a problem in New York. Innocent citizens are turning
to the police for help as usual; but one officer isn't bowing to the
law, and has taken it upon himself to dish out justice his own way.
This maniac cop is exterminating the local population, and it's up to
framed copper Jack Forrest and his mistress Theresa Mallory to save the
day! The way that director William Lustig portrays the New York streets
gives this film a lot of it's power. It's gritty, in the same way that
many of the seventies cop thrillers were and this, when combined with
the thick eighties trash crust, is what makes this film a winner. The
scenes that see the maniac cop taking people out are fiendishly funny,
but also quite shocking. The police are looked up to in most societies,
and it would be a huge problem if one of them were to start dishing out
the wrong kind of law themselves. Scriptwriter and B-movie god Larry
Cohen seems keen to portray this too, with much of the action taking in
the panic that previous events have caused. One of this film's main
assets is definitely the presence of Evil Dead's Ash, Bruce Campbell.
Campbell isn't quite as over the top as he was in Sam Raimi's classic
trilogy - but he's playing a different character and just seeing him is
a good reason to see this film. He is joined by fellow B-movie actor
Tom Atkins, as well as Laurene Landon and Robert Z'Dar, who is
perfectly cast in the title role. This isn't a film that will please
fans of serious movies - but if you like your silly B-grade films,
you'll definitely like this!",85,1988

1832,9.0,6.0,"This film features a comedian cast list that could bankroll a small
country. But even together they could not make a film I want to ever
watch again. I imagine their pay-cheques were so high, they could not afford to
venture out of his apartment, as thats where 75% of the film is set.
They have a few scenes in a school cafeteria and one in a studio for a
TV show, but alas neither of them has Simon's character in them. The talent they had available was exceptional and if Simon was given a
scene on the talk show about the book he was apparently writing - it
would have led to many great one- liners. But the scene never happened.
If he had used his powers on the naughty students in his class, there
is comedy gold to be had. But instead he just does nothing. Its as
though there were tons of set-ups but sadly no pay-offs. Since most the film is set in his flat, I have to believe its due to
budget constraints after paying all the artists and animators. Even the
world changing issue we only ever see through his TV set as a news
report, and never actually see any of it. Then we have Kate, who is a 10 in anybodies rating, and Simon who is
not even in her Universe. She felt so out of place in this film. You
could tell she had three hours of makeup before every scene and her
pedestal lifted her well beyond the reach of Simons character. Nothing
against Simon, but I just didn't feel any connection between them
whatsoever - there was no romance, other than what we were being told.
Then we have the fact that she had three guys making moves on her - she
becomes nothing but a sex object. She had no purpose, plot, story and
even her job which had ties to Simon was ignored. Its just who will be
the first to rape her, and eventually it becomes the one person it
shouldn't have been. Speaking off the rape scene - it appears the editor realised their
mistake and quickly edited in a cartoon excuse to try and soften the
blow a little. But it was too little, too late. She even calls him out
on it later, and then forgives him for it. Why?God Almighty, this film is not. Limitless showed better use of his
powers than this. Even Lucy had a better explanation for how they are
received. It just felt like a rush production in all areas and they
used up too much money on the cast, which could have been put to much

starting with the oldest (the Jewish) and ending with the newest
(islam), and each religion is introduced by a teenage girl from each
religion and culture.To be honest as a Muslim i learned a couple of things about how other
religions see the holy city, i cannot verify nor deny the accuracy of
Jewish and Christian information presented in the film, I can say that
Islamic fact was mostly true but the film was short and the Islamic
(and Christian) side of the city was really shallow presented, i liked
how it talked about the month of Ramadan and ""the dome of the rock"" but
it didn't mention the ""far mosque"" to the side of ""the dome of the
rock"" which is important as well in our religion. I saw a familiar
culture And faces looking like us in the Muslim side of the city making
me want to visit the city even more.The film also tackles an important issue in the culture of the city at
the end which is getting to know other religion people and stating that
we have a lot in common, of course what is preventing such blend is the
political conflict happening in the city and the country in general, i
loved seeing the city without Israelis police and checkpoints between
every two checkpoints in the city which we see in news.I would like to state my opinion in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict,
as the film states the Jews return to the city making {aliaa': going to
a higher place} and searching for the lost temple which was destroyed,
well, we have no problem of Jews coming to Palestine, but to problem
starts when Britain gave the country to Israel and they killed and
removed the native citizens out of their homes, some died in 1948,1967
and other wars, and many emigrated to Jordan with a strong will in
their hearts to return to their land, i hope we find a solution where
Palestinians return to their homes, lands are returned, and digging and
attempts to destroy our mosques are stopped, then we can have a
peaceful blend of cultures that really suites the holy city.Mohamad karasneh Jordan",45,2013

was it a wig, if so where was the indication!!!! Her rendition of ""back
in the U.S.S.R"" was hilarious yet catchy. Ray Liotta, Gene Hackman and
Jason Lee as the love-struck victims are perfectly cast.In the scene
where Jennifer Love Hewitt is on the bed ""sleeping"", and opens her eyes
crying, I was and still am choked when I see it. Fab film folks 10/10",123,2001
1835,7.5,4.6,"Molly Hartley is not a well-known name on possession game, it's also a
straight to DVD title which might not instill hope for quality.
Surprisingly, it has a few nifty gimmicks at play as it tries to
conjure different setup than most of its haunted peers. It also, sadly,
falls face first with corny scares and unintentionally funny moment
just when it needs to deliver the horror.Story follows not only Molly (Sarah Lind), but also the disgraced
Father John (Devon Sawa). After a botched exorcism, mostly due to his
part, John is convicted and lost his faith. Meanwhile, Molly displays
odd tendency for murder and unworldly pranks. Instead of going Vatican
on her, they throw her to jail, which admittedly a rather realistic
choice of action.There are a few different developments that occasionally show glimpse
of horror. It creates the right atmosphere, or at least the illusion of
such, and with it the movie tries to pull off timely twists. This is
already a better effort than some horror films, but unfortunately the
execution betrays all the buildup.The use of jump scares is appalling, almost despicably so. Molly is
also keen on spewing her meals unto unsuspecting victims. The effect
and make up are not well done, they only manage to be disgusting and
not in horrifying way. Perhaps, the worst is amalgamation of shifty
production and overacting that makes some of supposed intense moments
into awkward parody of itself.Watching this is like watching devil spawn trying to be full-fledged
demon. It almost does horror correctly, but eventually falls down like
a kindergarten kid tripping over his bike and puke all over the place.
Then again, one can't help but to give some merit or leniency to the
effort and buildup.",96,2015
1836,12.0,4.1,"I rarely rate a movie so low because... let's face it, there are few
movies worse that this out there that I try to watch. I chose 6 Ways to
Sundown because of Vinnie Jones and Bai Ling. Love them both, but guys,
why did you do this to me?From the very start one feels that something is not quite right. The
dialogue is overly pompous, without adding anything to the story, the
film is divided in chapters, the chapters are presented in a reverse
order, there are flashbacks that need other flashbacks to explain and
so on. The film is screeching ""Wait for the twist! It's going to blow
your mind"". If you got this far into the review, trust me, it is not
going to blow your mind.Then everything is really really badly made. The people dancing in the
club of the ""most notorious drug dealer in North America"" are dancing
worse than I do. That's bad! The productions values are low. The acting
is bad. Vinnie Jones spends all of his 5 minutes of acting in a car,
Bai Ling is beautiful as ever, but she barely does anything, Tom
Sizemore (which I really dislike anyway) dies in the first few minutes
and Vivica A. Fox... why are they hiring her anymore is beyond me. And
these are the best actors in the movie.Bottom line: a complete and utter waste of time. It's always risky to
watch something written and directed by the same guy, but this is not
even so bad it's funny, like The Room.",103,2015
1837,4.333333333333333,6.8,"This film is definitely worth seeing for a life story that is so
incredible it seems like fiction.I had heard about Christina Noble at school, but I can see now that my
teachers left out some of the horrors of her early life. She was
clearly a very religious person and that comes across strongly in the
film. However, the film also shows the darker sides of religious
orders.All three actresses are absolutely superb.Emotionally, I think this is a hard film to watch not only because of
the hardships the lead faces, but also the children in Vietnam. Having
said that, I think it is also an important film for a lot of people. It
is going to speak to people who grew up disadvantaged and people who
experienced all kinds of traumas and hardships. It has a lot to say
about how a victim can become powerful.Deirdre O'Kane has great presence as the older Christina.I definitely recommend this film. It touches on some shameful parts of
Irish and world history, but it also has a lot to say about courage,
perseverance and hope.",100,2014
1838,11.8,6.8,"""Set It Off"" is about four African-American women(Jada Pinkett Smith,
Queen
Latifah, Vivica A. Fox, and Kimberly Elise) who decide to go out and rob a
few banks. They don't rob banks for sheer enjoyment or because they have
nothing better to do. No, they rob them because they are getting back at
""the system"" that they feel has screwed them over in their lives. Here
are
the reasons: in the opening bank robbery sequence, Frankie(Fox), who was
at
the time a teller, was fired simply because she knew the suspect who
robbed
it; Stony's(Smith) younger brother, Stevie was killed by police after
being
mistaken for the robbery suspect; Cleo(Latifah) joins them simply because
she is p***ed off at society; Tisean(Elise) is a single mother who is
barely
able to support her son and when he is accidently poisoned and taken away
by
child services, decides she has no other choice. I feel I must point out
that up until that point, she is reluctant to join the other three women.This is a really good movie that is definitely Oscar-worthy material.
Maybe
not for the Best Picture category, but definitely Oscar-worthy. The
performances are excellent especially from all four of our young stars.
Queen Latifah should definitely should have gotten an Oscar or Golden
Globe
nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Her portrayal of a fiery lesbian
is
right on key. F. Gary Gray, who also directed Ice Cube and Chris Tucker
in
""Friday"", is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. I don't think
you should really call ""Set It Off"" an action movie since there isn't
really
action until the ending.A line from the movie, ""if that crackhead Darnell can rob a bank, then so
can we."" This quote outlines the main message that the movie is trying to
tell: the social standing of women in our society, saying that they have
rights too. The movie says that women can basically do anything men can
do
(and probably better) and they must be applauded for their efforts. Now
I'm
not saying that women should all go out and round up their friends and
start
robbing banks. Director F. Gary Gray definitely should be praised for his
smart casting choices.10/10P.S.: Now from the sound of this review, I've probably got you thinking

daughter is so compelling, yet so young. I found myself spellbound by
her eyes and her whole facial expression and body language to establish
a mother- daughter tension and young impatient ambition as interesting
as the romance between two fifty year-old's married to someone other
than present company. Andy Garcia is perfectly cast and appealing to
follow as he and this opinionated broad clash and fall in love with
their opposite type. This a a movie about life portrayed as extremely
attractive yet farcical. It is pure entertainment that wins over an
audience within minutes. It dares to confront the real and possibly
dull or difficult with the fun, funny, and fanciful and a real good
slap in the face which echoes I needed that. Why give it a 10? Because
it never missed a beat.",99,2013
1840,8.0,6.3,"All the other posters make good points, but the one they miss is that
this is first, last and simply, pure Milius. If you don't know who John
Milius is you probably do not read movie credits. John Milius is a
screen writer and director. Kind of a cult figure. His stock in trade
is manly virtue. His detractors would use the term ""macho"", but that is
too derogatory. Movies you may have see by him are, ""Wind and the Lion,
Red Dawn, Conan the Barbarian, Jeremiah Johnson, Clear and Present
Danger, The Rough Riders, Apocalypse Now, Magnum Force, Dirty Harry,
Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean. See a pattern here? Every one of the above movies deals with male relationships, honor,
loyalty, fall and redemption. Romance relationships take a back seat to
the relationships between the male characters, be they protagonists or
antagonists. Jeramiah Johnson is a great example of this and shares
many theme similarities with Farewell to the King.Milius the director's sense of honor transcends the norm and
underscores his reputation as a Hollywood rebel and outcast. Leroyd is
betrayed by his erstwhile allies symbolized by Gen. MacArthur who gives
his word and violates that promise. Leroyd ultimately accepts his
former hated Japanese enemy simply because he too possesses a personal
code of honor similar to Leroyd. A similar scene plays out at the end
of Red Dawn, where the Cuban Commander lets the dying Jed escape,
carrying his dead brother (Charlie Sheen through a shared warriors
sense of honor. Jed then goes to a playground to sit in a swing,
presumably regaining their lost childhood in joined death. This is a
familiar theme in Milius' work. Another familiar theme is that of the Rebel or loose cannon. Dirty
Harry, the Marine Captain in Wind and the Lion, are just a few
examples. Milius is the quintessential loose cannon in Hollywood. So he
probably feels a kinship to the characters of which he writes. There are many other themes that are familiar to all his movies. The
female as a catalyst and semi-tragic figure is another. His women move
his protagonists to greater heights. The female at risk or her
unfortunate demise drives the central character to either his doom or
his redemption, or both. I have to say that I am a Milius fan. This movie is one of my favorites
by him. Yes, I cringe at some of the acting, like Sgt. Tenga's horrible
fake British accent (Kenyan by way of Chicago, perhaps?) The English
speaking ""Apaches"" also make me roll my eyes. But scenes like ""Advance
the Colors"", or Leroyd's redemption at the end of the movie, more than
make up for the other lapses. This movie is good stuff. Get a six pack,
or a bottle of scotch, a few cigars, some munchies and enter the world
of John Milius. A world where men live by their honor, disputes are
resolved man to man, and if enemies survive the ordeal, the sit down
and drink to one another as survivors.",117,1989
1841,4.666666666666667,7.6,"The greatness and pure genius of ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is
that, while it is uproariously hilarious, it also reveals great hurt
and truth - unlike any comedy I have ever seen before or since. Scenes such as those in the Bravewood Inn are classics. The argument
between Neal and Del is the turning point in the film, and it is the
first time that the audience realizes that they are in for more than
they thought they were. There are certain elements of tenderness,
heart, agony, conflict, and heartfelt emotion in ""Planes, Trains and
Automobiles"" that make it transcend the genre. Steve Martin and John Candy don't just act; they embody themselves so
deeply in their characters that it almost sets a standard for how
comedic pairings should be. Line them up next to Chris Farley and David
Spade and the differences are astronomical. Watching Steve Martin is
like acting a comedian at the top of his game. Just watch his
reactions. The facial reaction from Steve in response to Del's comeback
in the Bravewood Inn is perfect; we understand what Neal is going
through, and Steve Martin lets us know this by placing himself in a
recognizable area. We also understand Del, and that is really the key
to this movie: Being able to identify with both characters almost
equally. How often can you say that about buddy pictures? I don't ever
feel much sympathy for Chris Farley, if that means anything.John Candy remains one of the most underrated and underwritten film
comedians of all time. Offered constant mediocre scripts during the
eighties and early nineties, all the way up until his death in 1994, he
could make the material something more, something watchable. I recently
viewed ""Funny Farm,"" a painfully unfunny film to sit through. I
imagined what John Candy could have done with Chevy Chase's role, and I
found myself laughing. Why? Because John Candy can make anything
watchable. Just how many times would you watch ""Summer Rental"" or ""The
Great Outdoors"" if the lead actor was Jim Carrey?There's some important content in this film, but it is never
overpowered by laughs, nor vice versa. They go hand-in-hand. I come
back to the Bravewood Inn argument scene. After the hilarious, ongoing
insults Neal throws at Del, Del responds and says, ""You wanna hurt me?
Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target.
Yeah, you're right, I talk too much. But I also listen too much. I
could be a cold-hearted cynical like you, but I don't like to hurt
people's feelings. So you go right on and think what you like about me.
But I'm not changing. I - I like me. My wife likes me. My customers
like me. 'Cause I'm the real deal. Whatcha see is whatcha get."" It's
creepy how much dramatic, emotional and truthful subtext sneaks into
this film, and yet it only makes it all the better for it. ""Planes,
Trains and Automobiles"" is my favorite Comedy, yes I know that I have
said it before. But, it is a serious comedy that has both heart and is
hilarious at the same time. Entertainment at it's best. And isn't that
what movies are all about? 5/5 stars.",93,1987
1842,6.666666666666667,5.0,"A horror movie doesn't necessarily always have to be good or
surprising. Sometimes it's more than sufficient already if it lives up
your hopes and/or expectations. In case of ""Stung"", for example, I had
only set my hopes on seeing an unhinged and over-the-top giant
creature-feature with plentiful of gore and a straightforward
simplistic plot. Guess what! ""Stung"" delivers just that! And if you
aren't too skeptical either, you're guaranteed to have a fun time with
this German/American co-production that is (nearly) a genuine throwback
to the glorious days of 70s animal-horror. There exist several
bee-movies (like ""The Swarm"", ""The Deadly Bees"" or ""Terror out of the
Sky""), but apart from Roger Corman's ""Wasp Woman"" there aren't too many
movies about killer wasps to my knowledge. The recipe for pure
entertainment here exists of a totally bonkers plot, good old-
fashioned gross-out special effects and bad but likable acting
performances. The nervous and uptight Julia has just taken over her
father's catering company and constantly worries that things will go
wrong, in sheer contrast to her co-worker Paul, who just wants to
relax, smoke weed and make out with Julia. They head out to cater the
annual garden party of the eccentric Mrs. Perch and her creepy son
Sydney at their secluded country estate. Mr. Perch used to make a
fortune in the pharmaceutical business, but now his wife and son
remember his death through annual garden parties where several
prominent community members come to, like Mayor Caruthers for example.
The evening quickly turns into a nightmare, as hundreds of mutated
wasps intrude the party and viciously attack the guests. Since oddball
Sydney experimented with chemical pesticides and fertilizers, the wasps
are oversized and extremely aggressive  and they lay their eggs inside
their victims' bodies, with horrendous subsequences. After an
admittedly rather slow start, ""Stung"" is a non-stop fun and thrill-
ride with too many gory highlights to list. The sight of humongous
wasp-monsters bursting out of their human hosts is just terrific,
especially because quite often the human leftovers  like entire heads
 remain stuck on their insect armor. There's a nicely balanced mixture
of traditional special effects and above-average decent computer
engineered effects. The sound effects of the films are also
imaginatively nasty. Apparently the sound of cracking lobster shells
can be used to imitate the sound of giant fake wasps! As said, the
acting performances aren't very good, but they are definitely likable.
There's a nice and almost natural chemistry between Matt O'Leary and
Jessica Cook, while the familiar faces Lance Henriksen and Clifton
Collins Jr. are responsible for the more memorable and flamboyant
supportive roles. Oh, and the answer to the riddle in the subject line is: Stinging in
the Rain",87,2015
1843,3.0,7.6,"Well, Jackie Chan has had an interesting career. On one hand, he's made some
classics like Project A and Dragons Forever. On the other hand, he's made
some less-than-spectacular movies like Crime Story and First Strike. This
movie is easily his best film ever...and also one the best martial arts
movies ever made. He revisits the role that made him famous: Wong Fei Hung,
the drunken master. The plot deals with smugglers trying to steal China's
treasures, but in the end it isn't important. The fights are what matters,
and Chan fights like a son of a gun. There are some excellent traditional
fight scenes like him fighting Lau Kar Leung and one w/ a Choy li fut
stylist. There's a memorable fight against an Ax Gang (Ax army is more like
it). The finale, where he takes on the smugglers led by a super kicking Thai
boxer, is probably the greatest fight scene choreographed. This movie

HK movies, or just Jackie Chan himself.",102,1994

aspirations. Not your typical film. Based on novel by Joyce Cary (very
good novel) and pretty much sticking to the book's plot etc., this
story should touch your feelings fairly deeply and perhaps make you
think about the illusions (delusions) and impossibilities that drench
many people's lives. Beresford (Driving Miss daisy, Breaker Morant)
directs tautly and beautifully. Watching this film should make you a
wiser, deeper person--don't miss it. (will probably have to buy copy
from Amazon or ebay or perhaps from netflix.) Set in Africa, colonial
theme is important. Moreover, racial dimension (protagonist is black)
makes the story edge towards the politically incorrect. The hero's skin
color is significant, but he is not a victim of racism--at least not in
liberal's knee-jerk way.",101,1990
1845,8.5,6.8,"Is there a genre that Rob Reiner can't work in and make successful? He
captured comedy beautifully with The Sure Thing. Music was brilliant with
This is Spinal Tap. Horror? How about Misery? Courtroom drama was
awesome
with A Few Good Men. And now we have a political drama/comedy. There is
nothing this man can't do.This movie works inspite of people's claims that it is too political. Well
you know what, it's about the president of the United States of America,
there's going to be a bit of poiltics in it. And guess what, guns do kill
people, so to have an issue at hand here that deals with gun control is
applaudable.Okay, that's out of the way, let's talk about the film itself. Because it
is wonderful. It is funny, well acted, and it is written with a good ear.The cast in this film is one to be envied by almost everyone except Oliver
Stone and Robert Altman who seem to get everyone to do their films. But
here we have Douglas as the president, Sheen as his aid, Michael J. Fox,
Samantha Mathis, Annette Bening as Sydney Ellen Wade and in my favourite
performance, Richard Dreyfuss as the sniveling weasle Senator Bob
Rumsen.As the story goes, the president's character gets questioned when he ( a
widow ) finds a girlfriend in Sydney Wade. The issues are handled
wonderfully here. Nothing is really tip-toed around as the script writer (
Aaron Sorkin ) writes a brave script about what is right and wrong with
being the president and having a girlfriend.I personally liked the politics in the film. I enjoyed how Shepherd
decides
to ignore the critisism leveled at him until the very end when he gives one
of the best written speeches I've ever seen in film. And when he flexes
his
authoritative muscles, you feel his power, you feel that the president has
spoken. And I was moved. This is a great film and one that should be
checked out for sure.**** I also found it to be interesting that the character in the film that
tries to get the issue of gun control brought to the forefront is Michael
J.
Fox. He is Canadian and we don't have problems with guns here. Is it a
coincidence ( probably ) that he was chosen to play this role? Or was it
done deliberately? Interesting.",114,1995

content was worthy enough to be associated with HP, but much of the film

1848,10.25,7.3,"""The Return of the Living Dead"" has held a special place in my heart for
a
very long time. This satirical take on Romero's classic (if you don't
know
which one, you shouldn't be reading this) is one of the greatest horror
films ever made and is also one of the most respected. The direction by
Dan
O'Bannon, writer of ""Alien"" (also one of the greatest), is superb and
Jules
Brenner's cinematography is stunning for a film not shot in a widescreen
aspect ratio (it was shot 1.37:1 full frame to save money). The scene
with
the rising of the zombies is best described as hauntingly beautiful yet
chilling. The cast gives great performances and the special effects are
astounding, as is Matt Clifford's rousing score. The nasty going-ons is
highlighted by a powerful metal soundtrack featuring The Cramps and Billy
Idol.The plot concerns some nasty chemical that has the ability to bring the
dead
back to life. When a barrel of the stuff is accidentally opened, all hell
breaks loose: the cast is forced to do battle with scores of zombies
(this
time hungry for brains). Twists and turns abound as the cast is trapped
at
Ground Zero-the epicenter of the plague, if you will. All of the
characters
are likely even though they are mostly sleazy and corrupt. Linnea Quigley
is
great as Trash as is Clu Gulager as the corrupt warehouse owner. The
zombies
themselves are fun to watch; be warned, however, that they are not the
usual
slow, shuffling stiffs we've all come to love.All in all, ""The Return of the Living Dead"" is an amazing thrill ride
that
will remain in your mind long after it's over. Do yourself a favor and
seek
out this cult classic. You won't regret it!",91,1985
1849,13.0,6.1,"I was puzzled by the low rating ""Vampires"" got, it's my favorite movie of
1998/99. Why do I give the date in that manner? I was (un)fortunate enough
to see this movie in the uncut version (as shown in France), in the US
version and just a few weeks ago in the German one.But first things first -- I am female and I have read so many reviews and
comments telling me, that I, as a woman, should feel disgust at the
alleged
misogynous undertone of ""Vampires"". I am sorry, but in none of the three
versions I saw did I feel, hear or see anything which might support this
allegation! Crow hated practically everyone except for Montoya and the
first
priest, Montoya -- while quipping left and right -- behaved quite kindly
towards Lee's hooker except where she directly caused him to react
violently
and none of the other oneliners warrant, IMO, even a raised eyebrow
regarding that special topic.Let me add that I also am not religious, with my own perceptive view of
enough past wrongs done by the Catholic church, so that any of the
soi-disant ""hate"" directed at that church is in my opinion well-founded
given the plot. Callan's explanation of how he views god, as well as
several
other references by Crow and Montoya underline the basic belief of the
vampire hunters while maintaining their no-nonsense attitude.With that back to why I liked the movie so much: it is in its own way as
stark and streamlined as the best samples of its genre; the cinematography
is just perfect with the right mixture of visual and non-visual
storytelling; the dialogue is engagingly humorous throughout, feels real
and
allows each character his or her own voice; there are several deeply
moving
scenes, either visually or characterwise moving, which will stay with the
audience; there are enough novelties incorporated to make this rendition
of
the vampire theme fresh and quite frankly, I liked Carpenter's score a lot
too.What wins me completely over is the very obvious fun all the actors had
with
their roles. James Woods was perfect as sardonic, illusion-free Crow and
his
brushing ""campiness"" with the tip of a finger, yet withdrawing just in
time,
is priceless. Daniel Baldwin makes the most of his character's arc, nicely
underplaying his role, while he still manages to convey Montoya's journey
by
minimal changes of expression or voice. The final scene couldn't have been
done any better. Sheryl Lee gives what I consider one of the strongest
supports I've seen in quite a few years, whether by male or female actors,
especially when you count in the scarcity of means she's handed over. Ian
Griffith had several fine moments and the entire supporting cast was
refreshing in their non-Hollywoody realistic, natural look and acting. The
overall impression was of people enjoying what they're expertly
doing.An advice to the German audience, I noted while watching the dubbed
release
that the translation killed practically every single punch line and nearly
all of the humor. And it *could* have been translated properly. The voice
actors dubbing for Woods and Baldwin did so without recreating even a
tenth
of what both actors put into their voices in the original version. I do
think that some of the disappointment expressed there is due the extremely
low quality of the translation and dubbing. See the movie in its original
language. I also can't see any reason for the loss of those scenes which
were cut out of the US release when compared to the French one. The movie
loses quite some strength this way.",108,1998
1850,9.666666666666666,7.6,"""The Hours"" more than lives up to its critical praise. If nothing else
it is a must see for the originality of the technique. The film (and
the book by Michael Cunningham) is structured around the process of
linking up three stories set at different points in time. Each story
concerns a woman trying to define herself, to identify what she needs,
and to find a way to get it.The 1920's story concerns Virginia Woolf's (Kidman) efforts to write
her first successful novel, ""Mrs. Dallaway""; which is the story of one
day in the life of a woman named Clarissa Dallaway. The story set in
the early 1950's concerns Laura Brown (Moore), a woman who is reading
""Mrs. Dallaway"". Finally the contemporary story concerns Clarissa
Vaughn (Streep) who is essentially living Mrs. Dallaway's life in
modern NYC. All three performances are extraordinary in their own
unique ways and there are wonderful performances from all members of
the supporting cast. It is as if each member of the ensemble brought
out the best in each other.Some interesting and not always obvious things to look for as you watch
""The Hours"" are:Each story begins with the husband/lover of each woman leading the
camera to the woman. All three women are found in bed and this begins a
match cut process that will repeat itself throughout the film as the
director and editor work to connect and unify the three separate
stories. Woolf writes: ""Mrs. Dallaway said she would buy the flowers
herself"" just as Laura Brown reads that sentence and Clarissa speaks
that sentence.Kidman's Woolf is an amazing character. She is a psychological mess,
making life difficult for those around her and full of torment and
despair. Yet she has a subtle charm that helps you to understand why
people found her fascinating. Like ""The Big Chill"", this is an ambitious character study film with
many characters. By necessity, both films rely more on behavioral
language than dialogue in revealing the personality of its characters.
Note Laura Brown's (Moore) neatness obsession as she readies her house
and herself prior to leaving for the hotel.Woolf began the book ""Mrs. Dallaway"" with the intention of basing it on
a society woman she knew who unexpectedly committed suicide. Brown
describes the book to her neighbor as: ""Oh, it's about this woman who's
incredibly - well, she's a hostess and she's incredibly confident and
she's going to give a party. And, maybe because she's confident,
everyone thinks she's fine... but she isn't"".At its core this is a movie about art but it is a broad definition of
art, writing a book-baking a cake-giving a party. Each woman/artist is
driven and frustrated by a need for unattainable perfection. There is a
touch of irony to each situation. For example, Laura Brown is where she
is because her husband has pulled her into the great American dream
without realizing that it was the worse thing he could do to her.
Although all three women love their children/child/niece, those
relationships do not give them what they need.There is a visitor and a kiss in each story central to the
self-definition process each woman is going through. Virginia kisses
her sister Vanessa (brilliantly played by Miranda Richardson who looks
amazingly like she could have been Kidman's sister), desperately trying
to force a better connection with her. Vanessa understands this, she is
not shocked by the kiss but by the implication that her sister needs
this so desperately.Sophie Wyburd who plays Virginia's young niece was obviously cast for
her haunting voice and her ability to display such a focused intensity.
Each woman has a child picking up on their needs, which the adults
around them do not seem to be aware of. Watch the scene where Laura's husband is urging her to come to bed.
Moore's voice does not betray the revulsion or the internal struggle
which only viewers can see on her face. In fact at this point each
woman's partner is urging her to go to bed but each must first a make
choice. Then watch for the great match cut, Virginia announces that she
has decided that the poet will die in her novel and they cut to little
Richard lying in his bed. Moore's expression finally tells us that she
has decided to leave her family. Streep's kiss signifies her
recognition of the preciousness of what she still has in her life and
her choice to embrace it and move forward.Ultimately this film is about the increasing difficulty we have as we
get older in making choices. This is because as we discover who we are,
we also experience loss and accumulate grief over the course of our
lives, making us ever more aware of the cost of our choices. Like the
Moonlight Graham character in ""Field of Dreams"" (who assumed he would
have more than one major league at bat), Clarissa looks back on a short
moment that she thought was the beginning of happiness and realizes
that it was her only moment of actual happiness.There are some criticisms of this film. That it is not political enough
but rather is for the elite and about the elite, or conversely that it
is condescending to the masses with too obvious a message told in an
unnecessarily simplistic way, and finally that it is a success of
structure rather than ideas. Whatever the validity of these issues, the
very fact that discussions are at this elevated level is the best
testimonial the film could have. My only criticism was a production
design issue, young Richard gets his Lincoln logs out of a Erector Set
box.",110,2002

painful. The sex was hot but the story and the acting was terrible. I
think it was not worth it and very very long. I can see what the
director was trying to do but he missed the mark. For the same kind of
story with the sex dial down and the story dial up I would suggest The
Dreamers. This story could be told in about 30 min, add maybe 30 min to
get invested in the characters and that would be good. 2h is way to
long for this and 5 min sex scene every 10 min is too much. Like the
title says. Watch porn it will be more fulfilling.Now for the actual review. The plot is simple. It is a guy reflecting
on a past relationship. The guy is a little to dysfunctional to be in a
healthy one but it is not extreme. The only real question you have

However, after thinking about it for a while (and forcing myself to get
past that ridiculous looking Bob Marley wig 50 cent wore for the first
chuck of the film...yikes!) I decided I didn't hate it. Mostly, I like
the humbling of the main character, the lessons he learned about
himself, and the family ties were a little heartwarming. I also
appreciate how he committed to the role. I give him a B+ for effort!
He's come a long way (remember Get Rich or Die Trying'?). But it was
too long, and as soon as I thought we were in the home stretch, it kept
going and took MORE sad turns. I started to feel duped and like I had
not signed up for this kind of melodrama! Certainly not the worst thing

ignore its dark, fuzzy appearance (I've seen it once on videocassette

British horror film in the old style, and if you liked ""The House That
Dripped Blood"" and ""Tales From the Crypt"", you'll enjoy ""...House of
Horrors"", too. The standout tales are 'Voodoo', which features Roy
Castle as a jazz horn player who nicks a piece of sacred African music
while spying on a voodoo ceremony and comes to regret it, and
'Disembodied Hand', an unpleasant story of wounded pride, foul play,
and revenge that stars Christopher Lee and Michael Gough. Peter Cushing
is appropriately sinister as Dr. Schreck, the German metaphysicist who
predicts the futures of five unsuspecting men with his ""house of
horrors"", a deck of Tarot cards. The soundtrack deserves a mention,
too--it's subtly creepy, and the Dave Brubeck-style jazz (performed by

a film buff, and my favorite film decade actually is the 1930's. Why,
then, would I even bother to watch a Molly Ringwald - Robert Downey,
Jr. film from the 80's which has a terrible reputation? Good question.
I caught it on TV the other day by accident. It tells a dull story (a
girl must get 25 thousand dollars to pay off her alcoholic father's
gambling debts and finds a womanizing teacher who eventually helps her
out of it, if it makes any sense) with a lot of implausible moments -
the scene of the robber singing Elvis, for instance, like another
comment mentioned - but it does have a lot of familiar faces and I
found all performances likable, particularly that of Downey Jr - but
then again, his talent should never be in question, in spite of all his
drug problems. Ringwald and Downey have great chemistry and pull of
what could've become quite unwatchable. In the end of the day, I liked
it and didn't think it was a time waster. If you watch it, maybe you'll
be able to tell me why. It's been bothering me.",81,1987
1855,9.0,6.5,"Even though not among his best-known thrillers, ""Coogan's bluff"" from 1968
is definitely a rather important and noteworthy movie in Clint Eastwood's
long and esteemed career. It was his first cooperation with legendary Don
Siegel who was stylishly working behind the camera. Eastwood was altogether
the star of five movies Don Siegel directed and Siegel turned out to be one
of the biggest mentors of him as a director.Secondly Clint was a very popular and noted western star back in the late
60's. He had just played the leading character, the nameless cowboy in
Sergio Leone's praised and beloved Dollars trilogy but his career in a cop
thriller genre and the splendid Dirty Harry series was still ahead.
""Coogan's bluff"" was an extremely interesting changing over from one genre
to another.Eastwood played Sheriff Coogan and it was clearly a cowboy role, no doubt,
but everything else around him, the big city with big city criminals, sleazy
taxi drivers, hippies, prostitutes and so on weren't no longer from Coogan's
world but rather from Harry Callahan's normal working day. ""Coogan's bluff""

watch it couple of hundred times. 9/10.",0,1968
1856,5.5,7.8,"I usually love the French animations, because unlike American, the
stories, musics, characters that influences the thousands of year
cultural history. Definitely not comparable to the Hollywood standards,
but it had its own technical brilliance. All I wondered was why this
film was in English language.It deserves to be on the upcoming's big occasion (2016 February), if it
is eligible for the American Academy Awards. From the director of 'Kung
Fu Panda' original movie, which was partially based on the children's
novel. The book adaptation is the stop-motion animation and the
remaining story's the regular 3D animation.Just remember the movies like 'What Dreams May Come' and 'The Lovely
Bones', those magical worlds and breathtaking landscapes. Usually
animations are associated with comedy genre, especially when a child
character attached to it. This film was not even a comedy, more like
those two titles I mentioned.The screenplay wise it was a very 'Neverwas' type, except this one was
an animation. But appropriate for people of all ages. The kids can
realise the importance of their childhood and the older people can
become kids again. The film compressed the gap and erected a bridge
between the two hoods, the childhood and the adulthood.""What is essential is invisible to the eye.""I did not know what to expect from it, but I highly satisfied with the
final product. The film characters had no names, but called, the Little
Girl, Mother, Fox, Rose, Snake, King et cetera as what their role is
and species. Barely there are only 3-4 characters where the story was
focused. Obviously it had a villain, but very unusual existence time
and in a crucial part of the story.I don't remember how the 100 minutes went so fast like a ray of the
light beam flashed away. The pace of narration was not a rushy, except
the opening part. But once the old man character, the Aviator, voiced
by Jeff Bridge was introduced, the movie turned into completely
different and awesome. Yes, Jeff Bridge's voice was so good for the
background narration.This story is about an old man who refused to grow up mentally and
believes the existence of the magical stars and planets. The whole
neighborhood stayed away from him and his troubles, until a new girl
arrives at the next door. The little girl befriends him and falls for
all his stories discarding her daily routines, but later it complicates
their relationship after her mother finds out what they're up to. What
happens to them and how the story concludes is the remaining part.""She was not a common rose. She was the only one of her kind in the
whole universe.""This story was finely fused between the reality and fantasy. Most
essential storyline for the present world. In the name of education how
the children were enforced by their parents to mechanical life with
less time to play out and make their own friends. Especially as they
were lacking the creativity to make up their own fictional worlds with
their toys like the kids from a century ago were.It might psychologically affect their characters while becoming an
adult like the Aviator in this film, but as one of lines from the movie
say 'Growing up is not the problem. Forgetting is', the children are
losing their innocence over the adult's reality world. Who knows,
someday those kids may become the greatest writer inspired by their
childhood days.If you ask me, I strongly recommend it for all. It is very encouraging
film for the parents how not to raise their children and for the grown
ups how not to get lost is the adult world. Most elegant flick of the
year, along with a very few others.You don't have to ignore it because you have read the book, like I said
it was not completely borrowed from the original material. Instead,
two-third of the film was freshly established out of the same name

differentiate between these two formats. But definitely the film

but mostly it ends up as a silly badly made mishmash. It's not a

absurd jump cuts to inject 'terror' but fails miserably at that.
Moreover I would like a refund from the film company since the sound
editing might have broken my TV. The jump cuts are so loud and dynamic
range between the whispers and muttering that make up the dialog, is so
extreme that I'm pretty sure it blew one of my speakers. Yes the jump
cuts are that loud and dialog is so muted you won't hear much or you
will crack the paint on the walls. Anyway, the story is pretty bland,
you've seen it a million times but instead of a spooky house it's a
spooky vineyard and instead of weird house staff, it's menacing
Mexicans that tend to the vines. The place has a past, SHE has a
past...is she crazy? Is the place really haunted? What does her husband
do all day? And why is Isla Fisher in every single frame in this entire

go through incredible pain and loss, but when we trust in the God who

1861,9.75,7.6,"""Best of Enemies"" (2015 release; 88 min.) is a documentary about the
infamous 10 televised debates that took place during the 1968
Republican and Democratic Presidential Conventions (in Miami and
Chicago, respectively), between conservative William Buckley Jr. and
liberal Gore Vidal. As the documentary opens, Vidal is commentating
about old pictures hanging up in his house and one of them is showing
Buckley and Vidal at one of those debates. We then get some background
as to who these 2 guys are, and why ABC veered away to bring the
""unconventional Convention"" coverage. And then we get to the first
debate... To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll
just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this documentary is co-directed by Morgan ""20 Feet
From Stardom"" Neville and Robert Gordon, who is affiliated with the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank. If you think that means
the documentary is kinder to Buckley that to Vidal, think again. The
two men are pitted against each other, and vehemently disdain each
other, even before these debates, and much more so afterwards. ""It was
a confrontation of life styles"", as someone comments. Yes, it was, but
as it turns out, these debates had another unexpected consequence:
ABC's ratings went through the roof, and the other mainstream networks
quickly realized they had to have their own versions of these
""point-counterpoint"" programs. In other words, the Buckley-Vidal
debates set into motion what would eventually become the Fox's and
MSNBC's news channels. Apart from the historical legacy created by
these debates, the documentary also examines the long shadows cast be
the debates over the personal lives of both Vidal and (even more so)
Buckley. If you have any interest in politics and/or in TV history, you
will not want to miss this documentary. It makes for completing
viewing, period.""Best of Enemies"" made quite a splash at the Sundance film festival
earlier this year. The movie's been out for months and I didn't think

this would not be playing very long and went to see it right away, The
matinée screening where I saw this at turned into a private screening,

1864,7.25,7.3,"Had it been too desperate and hopeless, ANT-MAN would have shrunk its
way for admission to the almost-complete, Avengers team. But neither
such concern nor saving the world from an impending catastrophic
destruction, holds weight heavy enough to pull this miniature superhero
from his top priority: winning back his daughter. The emotional weight
of the narrative comes across as an anomalous content to the generally
comedic structure of the film, but they serve purpose for the overall
flow of the proceedings, nonetheless.The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), who has just been released
from prison after committing burglary. He has been prohibited to see
his daughter due to his inability to provide financial support, no
thanks to his being an ex-con that keeps hindering him from getting a
job. He meets the highly-intellectual yet solitary scientist, Hank Pym
(Michael Douglas), who has a job for him: pulling off a heist on his
ex-protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who is in possession of a
size-changing prototype, that poses massive amount of threats to
worldwide security. Using a military suit that allows him to shrink
back and forth, in size, Lang carries on with the mission with the hope
that by doing so, he would be able to reclaim and earn the reputation
and respect he lost, especially his daughter's.It's easier to see Ant-Man as a beautiful mess, rather than a
well-crafted superhero flick with profound depth and sense . There's a
lot of illogical nonsense that always nearly sends the film to
wreckage, but there's also so much of the fun side to make up for the
eventual narrative shortcoming. At the center of its comic efforts,
Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man shines with his general amiability,
pulling off his role with credible wit and comic allure. Rudd is such a
delight here, and his presence and effortless take on his character
make the mostly messed-up flow of the events, extremely palatable.
There's also much to say about Michael Douglas, how his character, Pym,
easily integrates well with Lang and his daughter, Hope (Evangeline
Lily) , to provide a firm and well-knitted character framework. Corey
Stoll, on the other hand, is less impressive, barely providing the
needed threat to make his presence felt and his belligerence imminent.
But on moments where he and Lang engage in beautifully-choreographed
fight scenes, the ineptitude gets relegated below the more important
aspects of the proceedings, and once it does, the breathtaking visual
schemes work under the spotlight, capturing Lang's size-changing skill
with epic elaborateness. There's magic in every size shift, and the
visual artistry is at its peak to deliver the moment.Perhaps, one of the most immediately-noticeable difference of Ant-Man
from its Marvel fellows is that it doesn't engage, nor rush too much,
to explosive battles that generally results to immeasurable
destruction. It is noticeably evident on the fact that its most
interesting and most jaw-dropping action setpiece, happens in a toy
train set. Most importantly, this new addition to the Marvel Cinematic
Universe places its comic prowess at the center of its general effort
to validate its entry to the franchise, and that is achieved without
putting the natural action/adventure tendency of its superhero, nor the
inevitable emotional nature of its characters, at risk of getting
overshadowed by the rudimentary elements of the narrative.It's actually hard to gauge ANT-MAN using the same measure that made
the rest of its pack, mammoth and omnipotently powerful. But in its own
right, and sub-atomic scale, this microscopic superhero is clearly a
power behemoth, and it will surely spring back to its even bigger form,
once the Avenger call is delivered.",117,2015
1865,10.0,6.9,"This is perhaps one of the best movies I have seen in 2015 and yet I
would think twice before watching it again. The Stanford Prison
experiment is a taut and intriguing drama hat manages to thrill you for
most of its run time as well as making you terribly uneasy as you
ponder as to why people behave as they do in the movie. Inspire by the
real life prison experiment conducted at Stanford University in 1971
using college students where some would be assigned as guards and some
prisoners and were stationed in a mock prison for 14 days within the
Stanford University premises itself. It proved to be one of the most
disastrous and widely criticized psychology experiments ever conducted
by mankind and was shut down in just 6 days.The movie doesn't spend too much time on buildup as you start feeling
the claustrophobia and sense of loss of freedom quite early on. The
script has been top notch as well as the direction. The best part about
the script that I loved was that it remained truthful to the actual
events and the documentary style cinematography added so much realism
to the experience. The other impressive aspect of this movie is the acting. The casting
doesn't involve any big superstar names, rather most of them are well
known in the indie and television scenes. Phillip Zambardo's character
development was pulled off by Billy Crudup with absolute finesse while
Ezra Miller and Thomas Mann left a lasting impression with the
devolution of their respective characters. The rest of the cast,
especially the ones who played the prisoners were great as well, as
they were constantly able to maintain the sense of helplessness and
psychological deterioration throughout. The main star of the film,
however, is Michael Angarano. His character is what everybody would
love to hate. I used to remember Angarano as this charming kid in
Almost Famous and Lords of Dogtown and I was quite shocked to witness
the whole sadistic and borderline sociopath side of him. The only shortcoming I felt was the overall pacing. The movie slowed
down at some points; especially during the first half (I am not going
to spoil anything) and it could've done a better editing job. Some of
the cast, especially on the guard side could've used a bit more screen
time since the camera was almost entirely focused on Michael Angarano.
However, this doesn't diminish the quality of movie in any way. It's a
great albeit cringe worthy study of human psyche and the movie will
leave a long trail of questions for you to think about. Overall, The Stanford Prison Experiment is undoubtedly a great
cinematic achievement both in terms of visual style, storyline, acting
and direction. This is not exactly a family movie or something you want
to watch with your girlfriend and definitely not a feel-good
experience, but if you are a fan of psychological thrillers, then this
film will give you a run for your money. My IMDb rating is 8.1/10.",122,2015

about the late Steve Jobs after he died.The early scenes provided the
global outpouring of sadness when the late Apple founder died in
2011.The narrator - Alex Gibney - was surprised as it was someone whom
he believed should not have received the same outpouring considering
that Jobs is not a beloved leader of a country nor an entertainer but
rather someone who only sold modern consumer electronics and who
provided an impact in changing the world in four industries such as the
computer industry,movie industry,the telephone industry and the music
industry. But interesting things have yet to come after the start of

it.Also included was Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak,early Macintosh
director of Engineering Bob Belleville;iPhone team member Andy Grignon

million in its IPO;how he bullied reporters;how he cheated on his taxes
by backdating stock options and profits;how he cheated Wozniak by lying
about the payments of the Atari game that the latter designed;how he
manipulated people in his company;the chaotic workplace at Apple and a
lot more. Too bad that these got emphasized as Gibney was convincing in
providing details to it. After watching this,I know that many Steve Jobs fans and loyal Apple
products users would be upset once again as this is simply about the
negative facts about the tech legend.But looking more into it,I felt
that the global outpouring shown by billions of people worldwide have
overlooked these with the products he has contributed in the world in
various industries.Overall,the fans and the user would probably see the
man and the products he sold into the world rather than the horrible
person that is Steve Jobs.",128,2015
1867,8.75,7.6,"Strange film; basically entertaining, but not exactly a masterpiece.
One of the most likable things about Robert Altman is that every film
of his has been in some way an experiment, and almost none of these
experiments, even the very good ones, work perfectly. This is a great
example. As is obvious from the many user comments here, it's difficult
to talk about ""MASH"" without comparing it to ""M*A*S*H,"" and in fact the
most important cultural thing the film may have done is establish an
aesthetic universe for the TV series to exist in (and that really is
the only thing the film and the TV show have in common  as many have
pointed out, the tone, style, timing, and even character personalities
are quite different between the two). But taken on its own, ""MASH"" is
not really the anti-war polemic it's been made out to be, nor is it the
joke-driven movie comedy we might expect from the series' style.
Instead, it's a kind of exercise in black-comic tone; it subverts the
idea of war not by explicitly criticizing it, even through jokes, but
rather by being exactly the opposite of what we expect a traditional
war film to be. Here we don't see courage or valor or heroism or honor;
we see cowardice and nastiness and vice and stupidity, even from the
""good"" characters. The movie subtly suggests that war makes ordinary
people into silly, stupid, and vicious ones, and Hawkeye and Trapper
are no more exempt from this law than Frank Burns; in fact, if anything
they are more angry and mean than he is. This unusual approach to the
subject matter is well-maintained throughout the film, and never
becomes too harsh or ugly  and yet Altman missteps with some oddly
chosen episodes (Painless's ""suicide attempt,"" for instance, and the
overlong, if symbolic, football game), and the ending of the film is
abrupt, making what's come before seem even more pointless and
inconsequential. Which may be exactly Altman's point, of course . . .
so here we have another Altman film that manages to be simultaneously
witty, jokeless, boring, entertaining, confusing, beautifully thought
out, artfully constructed and artless, symbolic and realistic. It's
recommended, but viewers should ideally go into it with no expectations
whatsoever. 7 out of 10.",116,1970
1868,19.0,5.6,"I know that most movies are fiction and that we are not only supposed
to not believe what happens on screen, but we should also not expect
the people nor their environment to conform to what occurs in real
life. But that never stops us from hoping and wishing that the
characters would just do what normal people would do. Or do what we
believe they SHOULD do.This movie started off so strong then it took a turn toward
what-the-heck-is-this-ville. The movie starts off with a woman escaping
her captor who had her locked in a basement in the middle of nowhere.
She gets the better of him but then has nowhere to go because the
phones don't work (big surprise) and she doesn't have the keys to the
van outside. She finally musters up the courage and the weaponry to
demand the keys to the van to do what? To escape? To go to the police?
No. To go round up the other captured girls because that makes the most
sense. That's exactly what traumatized escapees do.The movie was a tale of revenge. I don't begrudge the movie for being
about revenge, I just couldn't get over the timing and the method of
revenge. Later we see why the movie creators took the immediate
vigilante/savior approach but to me it was a case of trying to be too
clever. Every movie has to have a twist. Too often vengeance movies sloppily put it all together. Either the
motive for revenge is silly or the person seeking revenge is unlikely
or the method of seeking revenge is unrealistic. The motive here was
solid but as far as the person and more still the method... really
wasn't in the plausibility ballpark. In all cases it detracts from the
believability which detracts from the overall movie. This was a ""I Spit

but heck its a horror film so its way above average for the genre.
There are also plenty of nice scares.If your idea of a horror is lots of explicit gore this film is not for
you - although there is enough to keep the less gore obsessed fan on
the edge of their seat. The focus is spread across 4 very different
sets of characters most of whom you wouldn't usually see in a horror
film. The exception are the young teenagers who decide to break into
their school, in order to investigate two murders that occurred in the
school's basement the year prior. This story is exactly what you might
expect - and no worse for it - but the other stories are all great. I
can't say any more as I think this film is best watched without
expectations and definitely without spoilers.A nice Christmas treat!",99,2015
1872,4.0,5.8,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning
** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Filmmaker Omni Timoner chronicles Russell Brand's meteoric rise to fame
in this little publicized documentary, from his fractured childhood
with his wayward father and cancer stricken mother, to his commute to
London to seek fame and fortune, and the whirlwind of mania his
unrestrained, egotistical persona generated when this dream came true,
with repeated scandals that ultimately only propelled his career
further, before making his mark on America, and marrying pop star Katy
Perry, before his more recent attempts to start an anti capitalist
revolution.With the film roles becoming less frequent (or certainly less
publicized) Brand now appears to have turned his hand to documentary
film making, or at least documentaries where he is the subject, such as
this self aggrandizing narrative. I obviously wasn't sufficiently
interested to get round to catching his wealth disparity doco The
Emporor's New Clothes, and so for what appears to be a similarly
marketed second feature, I was expecting something alike.With at least two autobiographies and endless media exposure, Brand's
chart to fame and personal life have already been well exposed to any
of his fans who lap up the celebrity culture he purports to despise yet
over the years has become intrinsically a part of, and so this insight
at the start of the film pretty much covers common ground. It's a less
satisfying departure from the personal mission he was exploring in the
last film, and for a self confessed egotist to see his life story
documented in such a way, the feeling of self indulgence is a little
too much to take.It leaves you unable to comment personally on Brand's skills as a
documentarian, and whether he can convey his social message in a truly
engaging light, but this missold effort leaves you a little short
changed. **",100,2015

still very engaging to watch. You can feel the desperation and the
pressing times this is portraying. The introduction of the characters
takes its time and still sometimes you wonder what the real motives are
behind some of the actions being done here.Still the action is well shot and choreographed, which is crucial, but
the drama bits work too. The pace is nicely done and you almost don't
feel this is a long movie at all. The ending might be a bit over
dramatized, but it should work with most viewers, especially after the
journey we just went through.",140,2015
1875,3.0,6.8,"'Shadows & Fog' is, for me, all that which makes a perfect picture. I've
seen all Woody Allen's pictures, and none affects me in the same way that
'S&F' does.The film is set in the early part of the 20th century somewhere in Eastern
Europe. The opening scenes set up what will become the basic plot (and
believe me, it is basic) of the film. Allen plays Klieinman, a simple clerk
who is awaken by a lynch mob hell-bent on catching a killer who has taken
to
strangling (or slitting the throats, nobody seems sure) of the
townsfolk.As Kleinman leaves his flat in reluctant search of the killer, we are
introduced to the fog swept streets of the village. It is here that we find
the real character of this film. Allen uses the simple story of the hunt as
a means to introduce us to us to true beauty in the night. He uses lighting
and canted angles to produce a surreal setting unlike any film produced in
the last half-century. Note the way light filtering through the spokes of
the circus wagons reflects of the fog in a way so beautiful and haunting
that it's easy to forget we're watching an 88min comedy shot on sound
stages
in New York.Setting the mood as such, Allen walks us through the streets and offers a
brief glimpse of the characters who inhabit the night. It seems as if the
whole town is up searching for the killer, and each of them is given a
short
moment to offer a bit of insight and then move on. However brief, each
character brings us further into the shadows and we soon feel a chill as
the
night air seems to fill the room.The scene eventually shifts to a whore house where we are privy to a
spectacular scene. Five women sit at a table discussing relationships,
fascinating stories given that most of them are whores. Instead of cuts,
Allen simply places a camera in the center of the table and revolves as the
ladies converse. It's a scene reminiscent of the opening sequence of 'A
Touch of Evil' of the Copacabana scene in 'Goodfellas'.
Amazing.There's so much more to say. Brecht's score is wonderful, the cast is
literally one of the best of the 1990's (Cusack, Malkovitch, Foster, Macy,
Riley, Shaw, Bates, Tomilin, Kavner, Pleasence), and the jokes are
hilarious.Above everything, see this film for it's namesake ... Shadows and Fog. If
ever there was a homage to night and all its mystery and beauty, it's
'Shadows and Fog'.",85,1991
1876,6.0,6.4,"I've got to say, this is one of my favorite horse movies out there. It
shows the tale of a different and quirky girl meeting a different and
quirky horse who just want to fit in a little more. It also shows that
sometimes being different is the best way to fit in- something almost
no other horse movie shows. The only things that I don't really like is
that at first, Moondance clearly doesn't know much about horses but yet
still knows how to ride and knows some of the terms (example:
""forelock""). I also thought it was a bit of a cliché to make the very
girls who bully her at school also her rivals in the horse world. But
it's a beautiful movie, so it doesn't really matter. This cute little
movie is unfortunately underrated and I can't figure out why. It shows
that being different is okay and you can do your own thing and I love
the way it shows the magical connection that there should be between a
horse and rider. The fact that this movie is based on a true story is
even more magical. It tugged at my heartstrings. All the actors also
suited their characters very well and were great at playing them. I
couldn't imagine this movie any other way. If you're looking for a
horse movie that's something a bit different with a moral, look no
further!",0,2007
1877,13.25,7.0,"This highly disturbing look at sexuality was way,way,way ahead of it's
time in 1952 when Carson McCullers wrote the novel, let alone in 1967
when John Huston was bold enough to bring this to the screen. It
concerns a group of people on a Southern army base in the 50's on the
verge of sexual discovery and insanity. Marlon Brando plays a repressed
homosexual married to the slatternly over sexed dimwit
daughter(Elizabeth Taylor)of the army post General. She teases him with
taunts over his ""lack of interest in her"" while she is having an affair
with another officer Brian Keith. Brian is married to Julie Harris who
has cut of her nipples with garden shears after a miscarriage
(symbolically ending her female identification and interest in sex)and
now lives in her bedroom, entertained by her effeminate Filipino
houseboy as they watercolor, dream of escaping reality and listening to
classical music. Meanwhile Brando becomes crazily obsessed with a
handsome enlisted (and psychotic) man (Robert Foster) who rides naked
on a horse in the woods and eventually begins to tease Brando with
sexual nuances. But Foster also is sneaking into Taylor's room at night
and doing something (I can not say it here, but it is solo and involves
her panties) by her bed while she is in her usual drunken/pills induced
stupors. Eventually all this Fruedian psychosis ends in the final
explosive scene, a murder. I liked this film because it delves into
dark subjects we rarely see on film, the actors are amazing (especially
Brando), the photography is top notch and the extremely well written
script drips in Southern Gothic guilt, symbolism and remorse (but no
redemption). Two scenes that sent chills up my spine was Brando
standing in the pouring rain caressing the secretly picked up candy
wrapper Foster dropped, as he stares aggressively at Foster entering
the barracks to take a shower and the final scene as the camera madly
jumps around the room accompanied by one character's horrified screams
and another literally gone insane. One of the most fascinating
psychological films I have ever seen. NOTE: This film along with
another Taylor vehicle ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?"" I've been told
by a film scholar,were the catalysts for the rating system that emerged
in 1968.",108,1967

1880,3.0,7.9,"This was my introduction to the world of Jacques Tati...and I liked it. If
Tati's filmmaking M.O. was to remind us of Charlie Chaplin & Buster Keaton,
mission very successfully accomplished. 'Mon Oncle' could have been a silent
film. It uses sound effects and music to tell 75% of the story anyway, just
as Charlie and Buster and their contemporaries did so well in the talk-free
era. He also has their simplicity of camera movement. And as with those film
giants, Tati is the star/director/producer and co-writer of this project.
His recurring Monsieur Hulot character isn't as famous as the Little Tramp,
but the quirky Frenchman is just as bumbling and likable.In line with Chaplin's 'Modern Times', the theme of 'Mon Oncle' is the
inability of one man to adapt to new technology. The slapstick sequences
that result from the clash of man versus machine are more amusing than truly
hilarious. There are a few big laughs, but you'll smile more than than
you'll guffaw. There's no standard plot. Hulot's sister, her husband, and
their son live in an ultra-modern '50s house. (This weird set is truly
magnificent.) Occasionally, they have trendy guests---the out-of-place Hulot
among them---and he inadvertently gets the ball of chaos rolling. If his
sister's house is too bizarre for him, he still gets to enjoy old-fashioned
pleasures in other areas of France. He doesn't fit in with these social
climbers, but the man is charming and unflappable in his own eccentric
way.This movie looks as stunning as Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' (also released in
'58). Both pictures use colour extraordinarily well (especially green) and
Tati's film would be worth seeing for the visuals alone. He also makes it a
delightful aural experience with a jaunty music score and comical sound
design. It's not all a cold technical exercise, though. The acting is a bit
exaggerated (except for Tati's underplaying), but they only look foolish in
the name of laughs. Will you enjoy a French comedy from nearly 50 years ago?
Is 'Mon Oncle' just a critical darling (Oscar for Foreign Language Film, a
prize at Cannes) and not an audience picture? Hey, I didn't think I'd be
entertained by a two-hour French trifle, but I was. Rent the Criterion DVD
and drink in the plush visuals, then have some grins. Come for the pretty,

direction, the camera work, the scenery, the soundtrack. The story may
seem
simple but the characters are skillfully developed and colorful. They are
real and interesting, not cliches. The desert setting and the stagecoach
itself serve to make the great directing and camera work even greater. So
many classic scenes in one movie. There are lot of little things like the
shot of the coyote howling in the desert night. The shot of the stagecoach
from behind going through a sand wash. The shot of the Indians on the hill
looking down at the stagecoach. They look real and they look serious. The
shot of the ""Ringo Kid"" watching Mr. Hatfield die.The ""Kid"" does'nt say a
word but you can tell he's thinking about his murdered brother. The very
first shot of John Wayne in his very first ""A"" movie may be his most
memorable. Even if you've never seen Stagecoach you have seen that scene
of
the ""Ringo Kid"" holding his rifle and saddle while waving down the stage
with the Monument Valley as a backdrop. No actor ever had a more
spectacular
debut. When you here the soundtrack, you can't help thinking about the Old
West. John Ford should have won the Oscar for best director. His attention

1882,8.0,7.7,"Appreciate Meru, for it is rare that a documentary, or movie in
general, able to bring audience in such inspiringly immersive journey.
This is more than just a trip to the titular location, it's a private
real life struggle of the climbers which we as viewers may not fully
understand, yet it's presented with incredible honesty and amazing
visual spectacle.The documentary spans across many years of the climbers' lives,
including all the trials and tribulations they must endure. There's
myriad of behind-the-scene video making involved as well as testimony
of friends and families. Everything is done with polished approach and
this honest nature welcomes audience even if they're not into
mountaineering.What's great about this is how they talk about the darkest days in very
professional manner. Having to describe one's own intimate fear and
life altering experience can't be easy, however the filmmakers still
present them with composure. It is rarely that they are emotional when
delivering the narrative, even if it's involving a very personal
subject, yet the appreciation for the extreme sport and the
determination are highly riveting. It also displays the hazard
strikingly well one can't help being absorbed in their excursion.The rest of it doesn't even need words as the documentary captures
beautifully taxing landscape. It offers so much clarity before and
during the climb itself, from the preparation, trip in the cities
before to the physically exhausting climb. There is no five minutes
spent without scenery worthy of being wallpapers or posters.Meru is a visually stunning journey accompanied by brave and inspiring

entertaining. This was a nice surprising treat, I really like horror comedies but so

1888,4.333333333333333,7.3,"In 1996 David Foster Wallace's 1079-page novel Infinite Jest hit the
literary scene like a rocket. The publisher's marketing efforts meant
the book was everywhere, but the man himselfshy, full of self-doubt,
not wanting to be trapped into any literary poseur moments and seeing
them as inevitablewas difficult to read. This movie uses a tyro
journalist's eye to probe Wallace during an intense five days of
interviewing toward the end of the Infinite Jest book tour. As a tryout
writer for Rolling Stone, reporter David Lipsky had begged for the
assignment to write a profile of Wallace, which ultimately the magazine
never published. But the tapes survived, and after Wallace's suicide in
2008 they became the basis for Lipsky's 2010 book, Although of Course
You End Up Becoming Yourself, which fed David Margulies screenplay. The
plot of the movie is minimal; instead, it's a deep exploration of
character. It may just be two guys talking, but I found it tectonic.
Director James Ponsoldt has brought nuanced, intelligent performances
from his two main actorsJason Segel as Wallace and Jesse Eisenberg as
reporter David Lipsky. Lipsky is a novelist himself, with a so-so book
to his credit. Wallace has reached the heights, and what would it take
for Lipsky to scramble up there too? Jealousy and admiration are at war
within him and, confronted with Wallace's occasional oddness, one
manifestation of which is the attempt to be Super-Regular Guyowning
dogs, eating junk food, obsessively watching televisionhe isn't sure
what to feel. You see it on his face. Is Lipsky friend or foe? He's not
above snooping around Wallace's house or chatting up his friends to
nail his story. Lipsky rightly makes Wallace nervous, the tape recorder
makes him nervous; he amuses, he evades, he delivers a punch of a line,
he feints. When the going gets too rough, Lipsky falls back on saying,
""You agreed to the interview,"" and Wallace climbs back in the saddle,
as if saying to himself, just finish this awful ride, then back to the
peace and solitude necessary actually to write. In the meantime, he is,
as A. O. Scott said in his New York Times review, ""playing the role of
a writer in someone else's fantasy."" The movie's opening scene delivers
the fact of the suicide, which by design looms over all that follows,
in the long flashback to a dozen years earlier and the failed
interview. You can't help but interpret every statement of Wallace's
through that lens. The depression is clear. He's been treated for it
and for alcoholism, from which he seems to have recovered. The two
Davids walk on the snow-covered farm fields of Wallace's Illinois home
and talk about how beautiful it is, but it is bleak, and even in as
jam-packed an environment as the Mall of America Wallace's conversation
focuses on the emptiness at the heart of life. Yet his gentle humor
infuses almost every exchange, and Lipsky can be wickedly funny too.
Wallace can't help but feel great ambivalence toward Lipsky; he
recognizes Lipsky's envy and his hero-worship, and both are troubling.
He felt a truth inside himself, but he finds it almost impossible to
capture and isn't sure he has, saying, ""The more people think you're
really great, the bigger your fear of being a fraud is."" Infinite Jest
was a widely praised literary success, but not to Wallace himself.",106,2015

Yes, I saw Juno and Young Adult, both movies that I thought had great
concepts and stories hindered by clunky screenplays. Cody's writing
hints at much of what people complain about millennials: narcissistic,
overly snarky, and the thought that being a special snowflake makes up
for being a miserable, unlikable human being. Ricki and the Flash
follows this formula once again.Sorry, but if you're a mother and you just ditch your family to
selfishly ""follow your dream"", the family shouldn't just accept you
back like it's no big deal. I just couldn't get past that. The story
felt more like a Disney Channel Movie than anything else. I like Meryl Streep and it was kind of funny seeing her as a rockstar,
but that was about the only good thing going for it. Her performance
alone made up for an otherwise weak screenplay and generic story.Hollywood badly needs more female writers and directors, but Cody's
flaws as a writer keep showing up movie after movie. She needs a co-
writer or script doctor to help polish up the unrealistic dialogue,
characters that appear more like cartoon characters than human beings,
and humor that is more eye rolling than gut busting.I think I'll skip her next film, like I should have skipped this one.",101,2015

East Asian movie to settle down so he can work for a water company
there. However, they soon find out that a coup has broken out and local
rebels are trying to kill all foreigners they see because those
foreigners are making them slave by control the water sources. Jack has
to walk through hell, fight off enemies to escape to Vietnam. Cool, really good plot. However, it can be much better. I want to know
better about the villain, not just mindless criminals. I want a bit of
side story and explanation. Although Mr.Hammond did explain a bit, I
feel that detail is just too shallow and it is not developed good
enough. I feel that bit is not necessary, a normal coup for power is
fine for me. Don't mark everything America with star, stripes and
eagle.The movie also has several errors. Such as when Annie told her daughter
to hide in the bathroom and lock, she ran the opposite direction in the
bedroom, but later the wife was standing in front of the bathroom next
to the main door (hotel, 1 bathroom only).Also when the sniper try to kill them, Hammond and Kenny did a terrible
job on keeping an eyes out. Moreover, if I am a rebel and I know they
are staying up there, I will send several men to get them right there,
not just staying in the tower and shoot. That is a terrible strategy. Hammond was really cool character, but he does not have enough screen
time, which is a total let down. The ending scene was not well played, I feel it rushes too much and I
feel they take only 5 minutes to get to Vietnam border. And the truck
was chasing, if they planned to kill, why don't they just shoot when

South East Asian countries now. Cambodia is going through big political
war between the current gov and the politicians who want to wage a war
with Vietnam. Thing was really tense at Vietnam's border couple of
months ago. I saw someone rated this movie bad and said it is a racist movie

1896,14.0,7.1,"The Gift is written and directed by Joel Edgerton. It stars Joel
Edgerton, once again, Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall.The Gift surrounds a married couple(Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall) as
they transition into a new job, new house, new neighbors, new friends,
basically a new life. As they shop for furniture Simon(Jason Bateman)
encounters an old acquaintance from High school, Gordon or Gordo(Joel
Edgerton), with a creepy demeanor and an obvious grudge.The Gift is Hitchcockian. I can't call it anything it isn't. I went
into this movie with medium expectations and left with a newfound
respect and awe for one person. This person is Joel Edgerton. As a
director, he can't do wrong. The shots were inspired and eerie. He cut
at just the right times to ensure the audience is terrified but not
disgusted. As a writer, he can't do wrong. This is honestly one of the
best scripts of the year and I hope it gets an Oscar nomination. It was
so well written. The major player in both the direction and the writing
is that no serious violence was portrayed in any scene in this movie
but yet it manages to crawl under your skin and linger long after the
movie's over. This is partly thanks to the excellent cinematography by
Eduard Grau. Finally as an actor, CAN'T DO WRONG! He was creepy as hell
but yet you some how want to root for him. He plays the role magically
and was by far the best part of this movie. Jason Bateman, oh how woefully I doubted you. At first I didn't think
he could pull it off. But he did. He was perfect as well. he was sly
and slimy as well as awkwardly funny and relatable ( before everything
goes down). Rebecca Hall in many ways was the main character. She did
great. Though she wasn't as good as Edgerton or Bateman, she certainly
held her own. Another great aspect of the movie was the soundtrack and
the score. It fit perfectly to the subtly creepy atmosphere. Finally
Since the script was so well written the viewer is left in ambiguity
towards the morals of a character and I find this masterfully executed
with every twist and turn being virtually unpredictable.All and all I loved this movie. Some might argue that the pacing is a
bit off nut with such a short runtime. Certain things are justifiably
stretched our skimmed. personally I didn't find this much of a problem.
The Gift IS my favorite movie of the year so far and is a must see. The
Gift gets an A+ or a 10/10. Simon says go watch this movie!",108,2015

watch this, if you are easily offended. It really goes out there and
language wise, it does not only cross the line, it catapults over it,
with a vicious grin on its face. If you know you can't handle that,
better save your money and time.For those familiar with the original (it's been too long since I last
saw it), there are a few throwbacks, most of which surely can be read
here. They are nice and as ""tasteful"" as they can be expected to be in
a movie, that really takes no prisoners. And I only watched the version
that was shown in cinemas. I can only imagine where they probably will
go in an extended version (that's surely happening, right? If not at
least many deleted scenes and outtakes, with more ""fun"" - for those who
liked it). Also many jokes throughout the credits, that will either
delight you or annoy you more - depending on how you liked the movie",99,2015
1899,2.6666666666666665,7.3,"Towards the end of the movie, Henry Cavill's Napoleon Solo asks, ""How's
THAT for entertainment?"" (when teaching the movie's villain a lesson
about monologuing), and my answer regarding this movie would have to
echo Waverly's ""very good"", as this film manages to out-Bond the last
two actual Bond films. While it might be the unpopular opinion, I in
fact enjoyed Guy Ritchie's two Sherlock Holmes films and so decided to
give this a chance, knowing nothing about the original TV series this
movie was based on and going in with no preconceived notions. One thing
that sets it apart from other recent spy thrillers is it staying set in
the 60s time period and not being ""modernised"". From the opening ""spy
jazz"" music, it sets the tone for what will be a fun ride. Ritchie's
unique directing style fits perfectly with this slick/stylish film and
he proves once again to have the right touch when it comes to blending
humor with serious moments (one example being in the most morbidly
amusing torture sequence I've seen since Bond's in Casino Royale).
Whilst there are ""talky"" moments and occasions where the camera lingers
on a shot for a solid moment, which those with impatience may grow
restless during, there's also action (but not such that it's overkill)
mixed with humour, some emotional beats and even the odd sexy moment.
It all combines extremely well.Interestingly, as has been noted elsewhere, the main cast aren't using
their own accents for their roles, with Brit Henry Cavill playing the
American Napoleon Solo, American Armie Hammer playing Russian Illya
Kuryakin and Swede Alicia Vikander as German Gaby Teller. Cavill, who I
found dull/a bore in Man of Steel (then again, I felt that way about
the film as a whole save for Antje Traue's Faora), is far better
utilised as the suave/cool Solo here (which now brings the tally of
cool movie characters by the name of 'Solo' to TWO - the other
being...hmm, let's think...). He oozes charm, confidence, elegance -
all those words that make up the definition of 'suave' - and has some
great reactions. One scene I particularly liked was him just chilling,
with a sandwich and bottle of vino in a truck he commandeered, as his
newly assigned partner was attempting to escape some baddies in a boat.
Just when you think Solo's almost heartless, he shows he's become quite
attached to the Russian with anger management issues and does something
nice for him (when they're not exchanging spy bugs or ramming each
other through toilet stalls Casino Royale-style). As expected, they
spend the majority of the film begrudgingly working alongside each
other, bantering/arguing and showing each other up. Illya might be
almost superhuman in strength and have the fancy fence-cutting tools,
but Solo has the expertise breaking into vaults undetected...almost.
Armie Hammer's better served here partnered with Cavill than he was
with Depp in The Lone Ranger. The two play well off each other and have
a nice fun dynamic. It also must be noted (since everyone's pointed it
out regarding Tom Cruise in M:I 5) that while this film has a lot of
stunts, both Cavill and Hammer took part in them, with the latter
apparently giving his stunt double ""hardly a chance to do anything
because he's out there doing it all by himself"". 2015 seems the year of the Awesome Swedes, as Alicia Vikander joins M:I
5's Rebecca Ferguson in making quite the memorable impression on
screen. Apart from some rough-and-tumble with Illya, Vikander's Gaby
sadly doesn't get to kick as much butt as the aforementioned Ferguson,
but still proves hard to look away from when she's on screen (partly
because she's dressed in eye-catching 60s fashion - which, along with
the film's score/use of songs, goes a long way to creating the right
'mood' for the film - but also because she's awesome in other ways).
Her character, a mechanic at the start of the film, soon finds herself
in the thick of the action during a great chase scene featuring her at
the wheel, with Solo in the back seat and the then unknown to them
Illya in hot pursuit (a fantastic sequence, with the directing, music,
acting all flowing together seamlessly...and manual window winders used
for great comedic effect). Vikander has interesting/fun dynamics with
Cavill and Hammer, showing some different sides to her character (one
instance being in an amusing dance sequence) whilst also proving
smart/helpful and that there's a bit more to her than you might first
expect. This trio of characters are a large part of what makes the film
as good as it is. Elizabeth Debicki plays the icy cold Victoria to the
best of her ability, although there's not that much going on with her
that one wouldn't already suspect. Hugh Grant and Jared Harris are both
good in their small parts. Playing Gaby's Uncle Rudi, Sylvester Groth
is quite memorable in his role.While in his Sherlock Holmes movies Ritchie showed us in slow detail
what Sherlock was going to do to his opponents (so we could actually
*see* it/make sense of it before everything sped back up and he moved
in a blur), it's sort of the opposite here, where we flashback to
things we might've missed, little details and such, that are later
filled in for us and thus make sense. The use of split screen is also
something he seems quite fond of, walking the line between being used
effectively and overuse. It proves an extra flourish to an already very
stylised film. I enjoyed this origin film of sorts for the team made up
of our three main characters - who hopefully we'll get to see more of
in a sequel, as this ended up being a pleasantly surprising addition to
the spy film genre. For extra background info about the characters, as
well as to learn what the acronym U.N.C.L.E. stands for, make sure to
watch the stylish end credits.",116,2015

1904,10.833333333333334,6.4,"I've seen the reviews here and a couple of comments set ""Taras Bulba""'s
location in the Argentine pampas. As a native Argentine I must say
that's not correct; the pampas run all through the middle part of our
Country but this film was shot in the Province of Salta way up in the
northern part of Argentina (some 1400 miles from Buenos Aires); the
pampas are a huge flat ground very fertile, but Salta is uneven with
not too high hills (""cerros"") very different from the pampas. Another
reviewer says Tony Curtis declared once that when he and co-star
Kristine Kaufmann got mixed up during the filming he was already
divorced of Janet Leigh; I don't know about that but I can assure you
that Leigh came to Salta with him (a friend of mine has a photo with
her on the ""cerros""). As to the picture, I really enjoyed it -also because I lived in Salta a
couple of years and the landscape is very familiar to me- but I think a
real classical epic could have come out of Nicolai Gogol's famous novel
with a more elaborated script (as a reviewer correctly stated here).J. Lee Thompson's product seems sort of ""cheap"" and lacks spectacle
(except for some real good battle scenes) although I admit if has some
very good moments. A somehow impressive one is when the big doors of
the sieged city open slowly and André (Curtis) appears in a frontal
close shot wearing a Polish armor and helmet for he will make a run for
food too feed the starving citizens inside in a clear treason to his
country and father for the love of a woman. Also the final dark
atmosphere Thompson achieves when Taras (Yul Brynner) confronts his
favourite son after a treason he can't possibly understand and even
less when André just explains ""I did what I had to do"". Brynner's performance though a little overacted is good enough and he
fills the role of Taras easily. Tony Curtis makes a great effort and
gets some good moments as André though he clearly lacks the appropriate
""physic du rol"". The rest of the cast gives a good support, among them
Sam Wanamaker, Brad Dexter, Guy Rolfe and George MacReady. German
actress Kristine Kauffman shows her beauty.All in all ""Taras Bulba"" comes out as an entertaining and amusing film
in its genre and a decent intent on Gogol's book, but no much more than

1911,6.666666666666667,6.6,"The Final Girls is a very unique take on the ever growing meta horror
sub-genre. It takes a group of characters and inserts them into a
fictional 80s horror movie slasher, Camp Bloodbath. Once there they
must try to not only return to the real world, but also survive the
movie before being hacked to pieces by little Billy Murphy. And once in
the movie we meet those lovable, clichéd characters that most of us are
familiar with, the virgin (aka the final girl), the quiet shy girl (aka
the cute girl who sadly doesn't survive), the sexy party girl (aka you
have zero chance of surviving), the jock (aka the sexual deviant), the
wannabe hero (aka you aren't the real hero so you're gonna die), and a
few more body count extras.The movie for the most part is very funny, especially early on in the
movie when we first meet the original characters in the movie. Everyone
is so over the top when we first meet them that it's hard not to have a
smile on your face at anytime they are speaking. Every conversation
leads back to some sort of sexual innuendo and it's great. But then
there are other times when we get some one on one time between a mother
and her daughter and the movie is surprisingly touching and emotional
during those moments. It's this aspect of the movie that gives the
movie a pulse, you care about these characters (even if the movie isn't
as dark and daunting as it seems to be).But that's not to say the movie is perfect, there are times when I
found myself disappointed with the script and the direction the movie
was taking. It's not that it was terrible, but there was so much room
for a movie like this that I wish it had thrown in a few more ideas.
After all the movie is barely 90 minutes long and I feel the majority
of people wouldn't mind sticking around a bit longer to see some other
ideas flourish. The Final Girls is one of the better movies to fly under the radar and
if you count this as a horror movie (which it's very light on horror)
it would certainly quality as one of the best of the year. Like I said,
the movie packs a surprisingly emotional punch but also doles out
plenty of zany mayhem to keep you interested. Hopefully this this movie

the movie advertised a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-reborn

slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer
it went on. It runs over 90 minutes, but it's telling a story that
could have been told in 30 minutes flat. I don't know what Pyun was
going for here. I mean the movie drips artsy-like style, but it's a
blur at times and maybe I'm an idiot for expecting more from Pyun this
time around. Here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially
great cast for the material, but it's all wasted. Crazy Six isn't much
of an action film, it's not much of anything really.I guess what's the saddest here is the fact that I found the end

sense of desperation.Touching little scenes, such as hanging out the light on landing, when

capture the spirit of a nation which simply refused to be beaten.The ending of the film is also very memorable, when the young pilot,who

1919,13.25,5.2,"I was wondering why this movie with a such a good cast like Patricia
Clarkson, Scott Speedman and Tim Roth managed to have a mere 5.1/10
(current rating when writing this review)But when I started watching it, it started to make senseIn the first half hardly nothing of substance happens and there are
plenty of everyday scenes of Patricia Clarkson reading a book or
remembering a romantic moment with her husband or fixing with the wood-
pile for the fireplace and stuff like that with very little dialogue as
she's by herself in the beginningTim Roth doesn't show up until the last 20 minutes, he's supposed to be
menacing but comes off as boredThe plot itself also doesn't make a lot of sense to me, it's extremely
simple really but the characters relations to one each other are daftly
written, and it's boring, extremely slow and could have easily been cut
down 30 minutes and you wouldn't have missed anything",0,2014

1921,3.0,6.6,"Entourage isn't a very good movie. It's hard to even call it a movie
because it's basically Entourage season 9 crammed into an hour and a
half theatrical film. It picks up right where the show left off and
continues with the same subtle banter humor and Ari Gold proving again
why he's one of the best characters ever written. People who haven't
seen the show will be confused, or at least bored, with the characters
because they really have no development throughout this movie. There
are simply too many characters to make a movie like this work. A
mini-series? Absolutely. It would've been great to flesh out some of
these subplots with multiple episodes. But a feature film? It doesn't
quite work.The entourage are up to their usual shenanigans. Vince wants to direct
a movie, Drama wants to get his acting break, Turtle wants to go out
with Ronda Rousey, and E is having a baby with Sloan. Ari's storyline
is by far the most engaging. Being a studio head now, everything is
riding on Vince's movie to perform well in order to save Ari's (and
Vince's) reputation, and in order to do that he needs to get funds from
two financiers from Texas - a father-son duo played to perfection by
Billy Bob Thornton and Haley Joel Osment respectively. Oddly enough, I
found their scenes to be the most interesting of the movie. Larsen
(Thornton) sends his son Travis (Osment) to Hollywood with Ari to see
the movie early and to ensure it's worth putting up the extra funds,
and Ari LOATHES it. Some of the funniest scenes come from the stress
these guys put on Ari and there are a couple classic Ari outbursts.
What Thornton and Osment really bring to the movie is a reality check.
Larsen only cares about money - he never watches the movies, he's
simply an investor, so naturally he and Ari clash when it comes to
defending Vince's artistic freedom. It was these moments where
Entourage felt more like a movie. There was tension, conflict, and
although the Texans are written as the villains, their motives are
actually grounded and understandable, especially for a movie as
extravagant and gratuitous as this.To get the most out of Entourage, it must be seen directly after the
show. It feels like the show never skipped a step. The writing is on
point, the characters are the ones you know and love from before, and
it has even more celebrity cameos (probably the most in any movie
ever). I'd love to see an Entourage mini-series if they decide to
continue this, but I was perfectly satisfied with this movie granting
some closure to the group. There's even a priceless shot of the
entourage walking down the red carpet with The Who's ""Eminence Front""
playing in the background. It's perfect.If you've never seen the show and are expecting a standard raunch
comedy, then Entourage might fall flat. However, if you want to make
the most out of it, watch the show (it's totally worth it) and then the
movie, and it will make the experience better by a tenfold. It's an
hour and a half of the gang up to their usual antics, and it's a
boatload of fun.",104,2015
1922,6.666666666666667,5.7,"Bad Milo is another great example of what is right in horror comedy the
last few years! Its a perfect blend of bad one liners, potty humor,
heart and gore. Who would have thought that a film that teaches us
about Anus Mythology, could be so awesome?! And I can't believe I am
saying this about something that is borne out of a mans ass, but damn
Milo is adorable. I swear by the end of the film you're going to want a
Milo all of your own, poor misunderstood lil guy! Duncan is an average good guy, living the average good guy life. He has
a decent job, a good woman, and what looks like a okay life. He
struggles with some tummy trouble, mom offers remedies, doctors try to
help, and eventually he ends up unhappily in therapy where we can get
to root of his problems. Pretty quickly this film pulls you in with a
great opening scene, and then it keeps pace through the entire film,
rotating between great blood soaked moments and humor sometimes mixing
the two perfectly in such a disgustingly delicious way that you may
feel both grossed out and ashamed for laughing at such wretchedness.
You will also find yourself shocked by how much you want to hug this
little ass borne, doe eyed, killing machine, i swear I even got teary
at one point for the lil fellow! It was awful!, but it goes to show the
amount of emotion that is in this film, not what you would expect from
a story like this one.If you haven't watched this film yet definitely add it to the list, it
is a gem! The cast is made up of comedy veterans who bring this film to
a whole new level of funny, and the gore is very effective with some
scenes really looking incredibly good. I will definitely be pulling
this one out again for years to come. It just goes to prove stress
kills, but sometimes its kills the other guy!!!",85,2013
1923,8.5,5.7,"It a shame that there is very few reviews about this fantastic movie.I am becoming a fan of Brit Marling as watching her works. There is
always some sort of mystery behind stories that i have so far seen
played by Brit Marling. This movie is not a difference. While it seems
as an ordinary comedy movie. But it is not. There is some mystery
behind it.The movie makes you think. It combines different senses, those senses
that you may not realize their existing. It is not a pure love story
neither a Drama. The other thing the i realize is its similarities with the titanic
movie. Not the story itself, but some feelings that you get with
titanic. I hope you see this too.It is also worth noting that while the movie seems predictable, it has
some lovely surprises.Good work.",0,2014
1924,4.5,5.3,"The acting is fine, Jennifer Connelly is always good as is Cillian
Murphy and the kid-actors were fine as well.Visually it's also a nice looking movie, with limited colours that
creates and cold and melancholic feeling which suits the movie just
fine, because it is rather melancholic.The movie though is just good enough not to be bad, but far from great.Needless to say Jennifer Connelly's character is very spiritual and
believes in healing, I believe her character is supposed to be Native
American although I am not quite sure about this but a lot of her
spiritual beliefs stem from them if nothing else.So it helps if you have some sort of interest in that or at least an
open mind because it's not always very up front and direct in it's
approach to tell the story with plenty of metaphors and subtlety more
so than direct big orchestrated dramatic scenes.The blu-ray version (at least the one I watched could possibly differ
in some countries) is 97 minutes, and not 112 minutes like it says on
IMDb.From what I've heard the version shown on festivals was indeed 112
minutes but it wasn't received that well so they cut it down to 97
minutes for the blu-ray/DVD market.And although that caught me off guard initially, I'm not quite sure if
it would be able to sustain my interest for 112 minutes so this could
be one of those times where the cut down version is actually better,
although I of course can't be sure about this.",112,2014
1925,4.5,5.6,"A character piece about the life of one grumpy old, senile man. His
issues are laid-out in grandiose & overly sentimental melodramatics. We
as an audience are slowly dragged from sad set piece to sad set piece
where the conclusions are obvious if only the film would spare us the
""drama"" and arrive at them already.Manglehorn is an Indie that knows its an Indie and is closer to ""Prince
Avalanche"" than any of the Directors other works. Al Pacino kills it
here but instead of focusing on the solid dramatic acting, Green
decided to over-direct this right into ""trying to hard to be
pretentious"" territory. Manglehorn is trying to re-connect with a long lost love while slowly
driving away the things he does have in his life. He's struggling to be
happy. Where in that the Director feels the need to have ""LSD
flashback"" type sequences is lost on me. It's not original nor refreshing to slowly plod an audience around in
drab and everyday circumstances, throw some folk music or a harp in the
background and call it ""subdued"" and ""special"". I don't need Jurassic
Park Dinosaurs or anything but I don't need to see him feed his cat 37
times to realize he loves it. I don't need to see him get his mail 32
times before you get to the point of why. I just need Pacino, with
something to chew on. I just need his character to fight these demons
already. I just need his struggles, his journey and his resolution. Instead you meandered for 90% of the film and slapped it together at
the end with some attempt at an thoughtful ending that landed with
about as much intrigue as a happy meal toy. What a wasted Pacino
performance. 3/10",97,2014
1926,12.0,6.4,"Mrs. Lowe (Ann Margret) is the widow who enlists the help of Lane (John
Wayne) in finding a gold shipment that had been stolen five years agoIn that time ten men rode away with half a million in gold The fellow
that was running the show figured they better hide it until things
cooled off So he took the Fargo box and rode south into Mexico He had
the misfortune of getting shot But before he died, he told his
wifethe mother of his little boy where the gold wasBut his widow decided to get the gold, return it to the train company
for a $50,000 reward, and clear her husband's name The reason: she
doesn't want her kid growing up thinking his old man ran around robbing
trains In mid way, and as 'gold has a way of bringing out the larceny in all
of us,' Wayne, with his old-times pals and two young helpers, find
themselves followed by mysterious riders who also want the buried loot ""The Train Robbers"" features plenty of gorgeous vistas, from rocky
scrub to a sea of rippling sand dunes Also Wayne delivers one of his
most memorable lines addressing Margret, 'I've got a saddle that's
older than you are, Mrs. Lowe.'",92,1973

fills in the gaps. Great writing. The dialogue has weight and sounds natural. Great scenery. It's on the outskirts of an old dusty town, way out in
the back-roads of somewhere and it looks beautiful. Great storyline and a great score all at a nice pace and under a one
and half hour running time. It has no need for flashy, gimmicky
explosions or a convoluted and overly-complicated plot. This is the best film I saw this summer.It's a simple original story that keeps you wondering what will happen
next. I don't know how a film like this can get made any more.Kevin Bacon was pretty great too.",88,2015
1928,9.0,7.7,"Kind of a guilty indulgence nowadays, this used to be required watching when
i was in high school. It really is a great illumination of the burgeoning
punk scene in LA in 1980. As the bands play, Spheeris prints the lyrics in
subtitles, which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the
guy is screaming into the microphone. But also it turns the camera's POV
into that of tourist, passing through this alien world. The band interviews
reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesn't exist anymore.
Then again, it's not as easy to come by $16/month former-church closets like
Chavez of Black Flag does. How many unheard of bands do you know that aren't
trying like the dickens to get a record deal? These guys just didn't care.
And who can't love the commentary of the little French dude who used to be
the ""singer"" for Catholic Discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His
gritty voice delivers one of the best soliloquies ever captured on film: ""I
have excellent news for the world ... there's no such thing as New Wave.""
Whew! What a relief!",100,1981
1929,7.5,5.7,"This movie sucks big time. It's awful in all it's extension. The actors
are horrible...all of them. It seemed that they never acted before, but
Larry Fessenden beats them all...in the worst possible way. Gosh!
deplorable act ...and the possession part?! I couldn't believe my
eyes...so bad! so bad! Althoug horror films not always have strong
story lines, this is incredibly bad...it's all wrong. Doesn't make any
sense. And the ghosts (were they really?)they seemed like a group of
lost boys...almost felt sorry for them. And what about Monte Markham
character? why did he shoot the bartender? W.T.F.? And the dialogues?
Can't recall a movie with so poor lines to say. And the couple that
later arrived at the house? they seemed so awkward, so unattached.
Well, I can't understand why was this movie made! I can't stop
shouting: so bad! so bad!",84,2015
1930,7.25,5.9,"I really enjoyed this movie, yes pretty much everyone in it is screwed
up but it's also very realistic. Their depiction of bored boys in
Vermont in the 1980s is dead on. What happens after is very interesting
with the East Village, CBGBs and the relationships and how they
progress. I recommend this movie and had no problem ""figuring out"" who
was adopted etc. Then again, I like movies that don't spoon feed
everything. I'm suppose to write 10 lines of text but don't want to include any
spoilers. All the actors did a great job, especially Ethan Hawke and I
love seeing Julianne Nicholson again in a movie. She is such a natural
actress. I wasn't big on the actress who played the rich New York
mother, however.",113,2015
1931,13.0,5.3,"""In Their Skin"" is another movie that came and went without anyone
paying too much attention to it and while it's not likely to win any
Oscars it's still a pretty good genre picture, in this case 'the family
menaced in their home by malevolent neighbours'. The couple are Joshua
Close, (he also wrote the script), and an excellent Selma Blair and,
let's just say, they aren't wanting for a penny while the vicious
couple who treat them very badly indeed are Rachel Miner and a very
creepy James D'Arcy. If the film has a fault it's that D'Arcy and Miner
are such obvious nut-jobs from the first time we see them any
self-respecting couple who meets them should run in the opposite
direction as fast as possible and anyone who's seen either version of
Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"", (both vastly superior to this), should
know what to expect. Still, this delivers the requisite frissons and
chills and should make you think twice before spending your vacation in
a lonely house in the middle of nowhere.",97,2012
1932,9.75,5.1,"Hell's Angels on Wheels, if you're into the biker genre, is not a
second-rate vehicle for its promoters, the Hell's Angels (Sonny Barger,
reportedly at the time, said it was the ""most accurate"" of the films on
them). Going by the sort of Roger Corman standard (not just for biker
movies but for his brand of 'fast-food' style films, not very good for
you but it goes down fast), of a fight or some other form of action
happening every 15 minutes or so, the film is hip in its period way,
and isn't pretentious in the slightest. Even with the name of Jack Nicholson's character, Poet, nothing near
the intellectual and philosophical realm of Easy Rider comes close
(though Nicholson's main scenes are some of the best in the film, more
comparable to Five Easy Pieces than the Wild Angels). It's about a guy,
Poet, who is a gas station attendant who decides randomly to go along
with the Angels. Some of the standard plot stuff happens; the hero's
girl flocking to someone 'else'; shenanigans in a small town; beefs
with the 'pigs'. Leading along the way, in a sense almost in an
unintentional training form for a later triumph, Laszlo Kovacs is the
DP and he takes down these images usually in more of a documentary form
as they ride around, and there is an added (if of course all in good,
violent biker fun) intensity to the fight scenes. Along with Nicholson,
his usual brooding, cool self, is Adam Rourke, turning in not a bad
performance as the leader of the gang.Is it trash? Sure. Is it worth watching once? Absolutely, at least if
you're curious about/into the period and sub-genre (the music isn't
very good, by the way, a sign of what was needed in Easy Rider). Does
it give a little room for Nicholson to give a little of his great
B-movie gusto? No doubt about it. And is the story paper thin? No doubt
about it. Hell's Angels on Wheels is stupid, rollicking good drive-in
style fun, with some technical flair and character actor hipness to
cover the tracks of the many flaws.",95,1967
1933,12.8,4.3,"So many holes in the story. This movie tries so hard to be suspenseful
and just fails completely falls flat. Please save yourself some time
and don't watch it you will be happy. I thought that with the actors in
this movie it would be a decent show... I was so very wrong. Wish I
could get back the time I wasted watching this show. Tell your friends
to not waste their time. They will thank you. Just does not make sense
how things this movie tries to portray could happen. This is not a good
story at all. So very flawed. You can see from the other reviews that
it is just a waste of a movie and time. I really hope these actors
chose a better movie to be in for their next project... wow just bad

1935,4.5,5.5,"Wim Winders has created so many fine films  Wings of Desire, The Salt
of the Earth, Buena Vista Social Club, Pina, Paris Texas, etc  that it
is a pleasure to watch his unique cinematic language again. Based on a
story written for the screen by Bjørn Olaf Johannessen EVERY THING WILL
BE FINE is a series of moments of reflection about the impact of an
incident on the lives of characters over the course of around twelve
years. It is not an action movie, it is instead a film of contemplation
that digs deeply into the human psyches of all the characters in the
story  and in many ways shows that 'every thing will not be fine after
all.Filmed in Montréal, Québec, Canada, the film opens during the frozen
winter that surrounds a young writer Tomas Edan (James Franco) living
in a tiny cabin attempting to come up with ideas for his third novel.
He is at odds with his girlfriend Sara (Rachel McAdams) and while
driving aimlessly after a quarrel her, he accidentally runs over and
kills a child. The one child he sees is basically unharmed and he walks
the child Christopher (Jack Fulton) home to his mother Kate (Charlotte
Gainsbourg) who, while happy to see Christopher, runs to the scene of
the accident to find her other son is under Tomas' car, dead. The
accident and its aftermath deeply traumatizes Tomas. Over the next 12
years, he struggles to make sense of what happened and continue on with
life, becoming a very successful writer who marries Ann (Marie-Josée
Croze), but when he looks in the mirror, he sees a murderer.
Christopher (Robert Naylor) confronts Tomas about the accident years
later and we are privy to see how even at that stage in Tomas' life the
incident has bored into his soul.The film quite successfully shares the trauma an accident can have on
all who are connected with the perpetrator  but none more damaged that
the man responsible. The photography, both in winter and all seasons,
is by Benoît Debie and the luminous musical score is by Alexandre
Desplat. The cast is first class with James Franco probing deeply into
a character so damaged it is difficult to imagine. Not a film for those
seeking 'entertainment', but for those who enjoy films of beauty and
philosophy, this Winders wonder is richly rewarding.",118,2015
1936,8.5,6.3,"It's hard to believe it's been twenty years since this came out. Kevin
Bacon is established as one of the best American actors (also, one of
the greats who've never been nominated for an Oscar!). Teri Hatcher is
the star of a huge television hit. Christopher Guest still makes
brilliant films and gives his actors more freedom than almost any other
director today. And my affection for ""The Big Picture"" only grows
fonder as the time passes.In ""Rolling Stone"" magazine's 1989 ""Hot Issue"", then newcomer Steven
Soderbergh was profiled as that season's hot new filmmaker. One remark
was about how students in LA based film schools have their works shown
at big events, attended by many hot shots in the entertainment
industry. Meaning, a young woman or man could have a ""bomb"" of sorts on
their hands before even turning professional! Not the most nurturing
environment for youthful talent.Bacon's ""Nick Chapman"" gets the full treatment as a guy on the fast
track after winning his school's big prize for his project. And things
don't go wonderfully well after he starts meeting the movers and
shakers in his new world. The late, great J.T. Walsh is a studio head
(for the time being) who seduces Chapman into believing all his dreams
are possible. Michael McKean is Chapman's friend, a cinematographer who
isn't necessarily the first choice to shoot his debut. And John Cleese,
Martin Short and Jennifer Jason Leigh have great turns as Chapman's
different associates that can't really stop the grimly funny runaway
train he's on until his self respect finally returns and he sees
everything for what it really is.Most films about film-making are not that good. This is a major
exception to that rule. Very bitter, but also very sweet. Just like
life!",100,1989

school teen, and his young filmmaking buddy, who befriend a sick
classmate with leukemia. The film stars Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke,
Ronald Cyler II, Nick Offerman, Connie Britton, Molly Shannon,
Katherine C. Hughes and Jon Bernthal. It was directed by Alfonso
Gomez-Rejon (who's most well known for directing popular TV shows, like
'GLEE' and 'AMERICAN HORROR STORY') and it was written by first time
feature film writer Jesse Andrews (and based on his book, of the same
name). I absolutely love this movie!Greg Gaines (Mann) is a senior at Schenley High School, in Pittsburgh,
who's made it through school mostly unnoticed, by only slightly
communicating (politely) with everyone (in every social group). He
makes short film spoofs, with his best friend Earl (Cyler II); who he's
known since childhood. One day, Greg's mother (Britton) informs him
that another childhood friend, Rachel (Cooke), has been diagnosed with
leukemia. He's then forced, by his mom, to spend time with his sick
classmate; against both their wishes. A touching friendship forms. The film is quirky and hilarious, in places. The actors are all
perfectly cast and the characters are all lovable, and memorable. It's
also a very touching film, and quite depressing (at times); but it's
always beautiful to watch, and wonderfully moving. The cinematography
is gorgeous and the score is perfectly fitting. The script is
brilliant, and clever as well, and the director is definitely one to
watch out for. It's sure to become a cult classic, for many years to
come, and who wouldn't love that title?!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:

also liked the first Magic Mike movie for what it was - very
lightweight entertainment, some hot male bodies, a bit of humour, a bit
of a plot line and some great dancing.This sequel is just grubby, and, well boring. The dancing is minimal.
Most of the 'performances' at the end aren't dancing at all. The Andy
McDowell house scenes went on and on ... and on, with absolutely no
plot purpose and no dancing, so what was the point? And the scenes with
the women 'clients' at the Jade Pickett Smith establishment are pretty
demeaning to the women. The bumping and grinding on fat women in the
movie is clearly meant to show what great 'performers' these strippers
are, able to fake it with any desperate female. I'm absolutely no
prude, but it all became pretty sickening in the end, and I was just

1982/2015.I prefer the original for a few reasons. The story telling is better,
the remake relies to heavily on the original to tell key points of the
movie for them. The original was more suspenseful and the acting was
better.But on the other hand, the remake had some awesome affects and added a
few twists of it's own to the story. They stayed very true to the
original without feeling like a rerun.The remake was creepier and that was awesome but the original makes you

the end of Punk. Now, i wouldn't attribute it with that kind of importance,
but in defense of that statement, the music of the bands depicted in this
installment of the ""Decline of Western Civilization"" series, pales in
comparison to the music of the bands featured in the first of the series,
(i.e. the Germs, the Circle Jerks). But, it must be said that this movie is
more about the lives of a handful of homeless punks in LA. It is a touching
film, despite Penelope Spheeris' constantly embarrassing and exploitive
interviewing techniques. The punks in the film are too interesting to be
exploited to the point of their own embarrassment, however, but i couldn't

wore the kepi blanc and the character of the tooth-pick chewing

1943,11.0,5.9,"After the utterly ridiculous good-ol'-boy trucker film CONVOY in 1978, Sam
Peckinpah languished for five years before returning in 1983 with what would
prove to be his final film--THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND, based on Robert Ludlum's
maddeningly complex 1972 spy novel.Despite the fact that it is often cold and sometimes confusing, this film's
weakest moments are far superior to even the strongest moments of CONVOY.
Rutger Hauer stars as a hard-hitting TV talk show host with a habit of
skewering people inside the U.S. government. As this film opens, he is
about to have a reunion with five friends of his from the good old days of
1960s radical college politics.But then a CIA operative (John Hurt) drops a bombshell on him: Those friends
of his (Craig T. Nelson, Dennis Hopper, Helen Shaver, Cassie Yates, Chris
Sarandon) are supposedly traitors working for the Soviets in a scheme
involving germ warfare sabotage. The result is that Hurt, with Hauer's
reluctant acceptance, sets up surveillance equipment throughout Hauer's
property to document further evidence of his friends' betrayal. When those
people start coming unglued, however, more is at stake than just national
security or the Cold War. So are peoples' lives!Though Peckinpah was clearly on his last run while making it, THE OSTERMAN
WEEKEND shows that he still could deliver the goods when it came to setting
up great action sequences. The final shootout between Hurt's CIA underlings
and Hauer and Nelson is edited in such a way as to resemble THE WILD BUNCH,
while its actual filming suggests still another Peckinpah masterpiece, STRAW
DOGS. Lalo Schifrin's score brilliantly accentuates things. Peckinpah, in
depicting the head of the CIA (Burt Lancaster) as the heavy, also clearly
makes a statement against America's heavy-handed approach toward Communism
in the Reagan era.All in all, despite its slight confusion, THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND works for
those willing to give it a go.",103,1983
1944,12.0,8.3,"The film isn't THAT closely related to Hans Christian Andersen's story; but
it would be a good idea to read the story before seeing the film. It's one
of Andersen's better stories, anyway.Another minor note: if no other consideration will sway you, see `The Red
Shoes' for a perceptive look the position of the ballet composer relative to
that of the dancers. For Powell and Pressburger it's no more than a
diverting side issue, but it's one of the things that especially interested
me. If you look at advertisements for ballet productions today, you'll
notice that the composer's name is NEVER printed - even if the ballet is
called `Cinderella' and the public has no way of working out whose score is
being used. It puts the composer in his place, no doubt. Yet musicians at
the ballet are in the habit of thinking that they're the most important
people there.I'm on their side. I happen to loathe classical ballet as such. `Swan
Lake' strikes me as a lovely score disfigured by people who insist on
dancing to it. Yet `The Red Shoes' makes me put all of this aside. Indeed,
it would be fair to say that I simply CAN'T dislike ballet while watching
the film - which is especially odd, considering some of the things it does
to people.So, yes, if `The Red Shoes' can have this effect on ME, of all people, it's
surely one of the best films ever made. I can't agree at all with the
people who describe the film as `melodrama' or `camp'. (The latter charge I
scarcely even understand.) The story is what it is and it's told at the
most realistic and sincere level appropriate. The characters who act
theatrically (NOT melodramatically) are all creatures of the theatre, and
have not spent not just their days but their lives in Lermontov's troupe.
If you want a more understated view of things then watch the musicians. To
put in a word for one of them, Brian Easdale's source music is superb: GOOD
music of a kind that an English composer like Craster might well be expected
to write. It's clear that Easdale wrote Craster's compositions first, and
then constructed the rest of the score around them, rather than vice
versa.",134,1948
1945,10.25,5.3,"A good idea (altough not original) that could have resulted in a good
film. But unfortunately it's not the case. So sad, because the plot has
some potential.It's hard to go along with a character when you simply don't mind about
him/her. Not that the actress is bad, but I think the problem here is
poor scripting/directing. The locations are cute, photography is
correct, the songs are OK and the film has it's charm, but it can't
help feeling somewhat undone or poorly done, at least.Not the worst film in the world like some people here say, but not a
good one for sure. Sadly, the premise could have resulted in a much
better work since there's a heart here.",97,2014
1946,5.0,6.5,"Director/write Jeff Barnaby just kills it in his first feature length
movie. Set on a Canadian reservation in the 70s the film follows Aila
(Devery Jacobs who is astonishing). After a tragic accident involving
her little brother Aila is left essentially parentless. By the time
she's 15 she's dealing drugs, though she wears as gas mask to ensure
she doesn't get high while she deals. The weed also serves another
purpose; to keep from being carted off to a residential school run by
priests where abuse is high, Aila pays a fee so that the white cops
will ignore her presence. The movie follows many twists and turns but eventually turns into a
heist film. But what a great one it is! The performances are all great
but Devery Jacobs turns out to be the real find of the movie. She is
astonishing as Aila, a small kid who has been almost completely
hardened after being left to fend for herself. The cinematography by Michel St. Martin is a stunner. Not to spoil
anything but there is a fight scene on the beach that is equal parts
beauty and gore. Do yourself a favour and watch this film.",88,2013
1947,7.75,7.6,"People with prejudice against silent films should see ""Tabu""; it´s a
masterpiece of cinema. The storyline is superb, a struggle not between
good
and evil, but between human will and fate; there´s a beautiful love story
of
natives of the South Seas, mystery and suspense; and, to boot, some of the
most wonderful sights you´ve ever seen in a b&w flick. The anthropological
genius of Robert O´Flaherty, and the creativeness of F.W. Murnau cannot be
denied; this is the meeting of two movie titans.",86,1931
1948,9.666666666666666,5.7,"Was pretty impressed by this, Sean Harris as usual is a nasty violent
angry man, but does it so well you can't help but like the guy, he
would scare me thats for sure if I came to blows, he's the kinda guy
albeit small and weasel like that would fight to the death and never
back down.The movie reminded me of some aspects of other movies, namely Sex &
Lucia where she is riding on the motorbike, the director had most
likely seen this movie, but did it well in all honesty and replaced Paz
Vega with 'The Goob', and also The War Zone, Tim Roth's only
directorial debut.The main character Goob did a great job for a first time job, and
Oliver Kennedy was very good, and sure to see him in lots more.I would rate it a solid 6, maybe a 7 if you wanna see Sienna Guillory
getting ass banged against a wall lol!",84,2014
1949,7.5,3.8,"Oh boy, just what the horror world needed a lousy sequel to lousy 2009
slasher Bikini Girls On Ice. This one picks up where the last one left
off, with wheezing maniac mechanic Moe (William Jarand) targeting a new
group of girls: the performers of a burlesque show.There are just two things that a film of this nature needs to deliver:
hot girls, preferably unclothed, and creative kills with lots of gore.
Although Pinup Dolls on Ice definitely delivers more nudity than its
predecessor, the girls really aren't all that attractive (if I had paid
to see them strip, I'd want my money back!), and the death scenes are
extremely disappointing, special effects limited to some fake blood
liberally splashed about, and a severed head in the film's closing
moments.Here's a run down of what you can expect if, like me, you decide to
watch against your better judgement: a totally naked chick with a
ridiculous trout pout and silicon breasts, an irritating slacker dude
with long hair, a gratuitous shower scene, lots and lots of uninspired
screaming and running and hiding in the dark, a spot of necrophilia,
loads of poorly acted conversation between the irritating strippers, a
predictable death for the cop (it's meant to be a surprise, but I saw
it coming a mile away), a 'shock' final act in which the last survivor
also dies (yawn), and an epilogue that promises a third movie which
I'll still probably watch even though I know it'll be crap.2.5 out of 10, rounded up to 3 for at least trying with the nekkidness.",0,2013
