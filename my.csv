0,16.0,4.7,"The idea of recovering from a broken relationship is one that could
make a very heavy emotional movie. The deep feelings we have for one
another when in love and the discovery that your partner no longer
shares those feelings is lot to bear. But why explore such issues when
you can just make another psycho ex movie.They must make at least one or two of these every year. However, such
films are not being made because they portray deep themes that resonate
with the audience. They're being made because they're cheap and pretty
much guarantee a return on investment for multi- million (sometimes
billion) dollar movie studios.With the exception of Rosario Dawson, who gives her role a better
performance than it deserves, no one in this movie even attempts to do
anything compelling with this material. Katherine Heigl's character
seems copied and pasted from her role in Home Sweet Hell (2015).
Although that cinematic experience was also a suckfest, at least it
tried to be something unique. In that film's world, her role as the
stuck up housewife who's willing to do anything (including murder)
worked (within the established parameters). Here, she plays the same
role but in a more grounded universe where you have to seriously wonder
who could possibly marry such an abysmal characterization of a human
being.I could criticize the movie's pacing if it had any. Each act feels
prolonged far longer than it should be with Heigl repeatedly messing
with Dawson as we wait for Dawson to figure out that her fiance's ex is
truly, unbelievably, Simon Legree evil. When we finally get to the
third act rather than following a natural progression the movie is
dragged there kicking and screaming as it allows characters to discover
things not because it makes sense but because even the filmmakers
finally recognized that this thing must end.What might be worst of all is that this movie concludes with a bit of
clear sequel baiting. At that point, all I could think was ""sure, why
not"". Let's get Unforgettable 2. Hell, let's build an Unforgettable
Cinematic Universe with spin-offs and team ups. In that way I hope that
I can leave this particular movie's universe and be sure to never come
back.In short, if you need some painful dental work done that would be a
much more entertaining expenditure of your time and money.",100,2017
1,12.833333333333334,6.6,"Maybe I had my hopes too high for this one. Like many other fans of the
original material, this adaptation has intrigued me since the first
trailers were available online, because it really looked nice visually,
but, Is this movie worth to be part of the GitS universe? - Short answer: Not really. Not even nice try. - Long answer: The cinematography its truly remarkable, it somehow
reproduce the atmosphere of the original anime, the decaying,
depressing, dark megalopolis is correctly reproduced here (despite the
giant weird advertisements that are spread around, that doesn't really
make any sense, and didn't appear in the anime, what are they trying to
sell?), the costumes, robots, and the general look and feel of the
characters are quite satisfying and solid. The music is not bad at all,
includes some of the original score and it work towards creating a
dense and dark environment. The acting is standard, not bad at all. The
script is.... ohhh boy, let me breath... to use nice words, the script
seems to be written addressed to children or to very 'slow' people. All
the rich complexity, all the mature and philosophical themes, all the
sides of the story that the original material let out to be imagined by
the viewer, all that is gone here. Here you can find a bland, generic
script, that explain a generic origin story, that never tries to get
into the philosophical or ethical implications of human body
enhancements or AI. Where the characters are one-sided, good vs bad
people. We are use to that over-simplification of a movie plot, since
we sadly live in a world conquered by the 'marvel'/'batman' method of
making a movie, where the plot should be simple and thin, the
characters shouldn't have any grays and the action should be convoluted
and confusing, full of minions to destroy for the sake of fill 100
minutes (well at least this adaptation has correct action scenes, that
are easy to follow and most of the time are not annoying). To wrap up,
a correct movie, that shines in the visual and action sides, but has a
forgettable script and characters. It will probably perform good in the
box office, and that worries me because what could come next, it will
be really sad to see how they reduce Akira, Jin-roh, Evangelion or
Cowboy bebbop to a generic action blockbuster without any of the things
that made those stories great.",107,2017
2,8.0,7.7,"I knew nothing about this film. Had seen no adds, heard no word of
mouth, pretty much nothing. I only found it only after tapping out the local AMC 24 and driving a
few extra miles to see something new.The premise was intriguing: What to do with a seven year old
mathematical prodigy caught between a cozy, loving household occupied
by her doting Uncle Frank and a one-eyed cat named Fred, and a
challenging but cold academic world ready to pace her on mental
treadmills for the rest of her life.McKenna Grace plays little Mary who's character is at the center of
attention whether she likes it or not. Mostly not.Grace's performance does raise a few eye brows as she very convincingly
plays a precocious and genius little girl plagued with boredom being
surrounded by the dead-weight of average students she has nothing in
common with.In fact, Mary's personality is also far developed beyond her peers,
exhibiting a sarcastic and jaded sense of humor more on par with a
bunch of 40-year olds downing a shot or two after a particularly bad
day at work.After Mary's abilities are discovered by her first grade teacher, the
inevitable battle for command of her future quickly unfolds.One very powerful supporting role is supplied by Lindsay Duncan who
portrays Evelyn the Grandmother. Evelyn is a poised and proper
Englishwoman armed with a titanium intellect few would want to
challenge. As the legal proceedings unfold, Evelyn verbally fire-bombs
the entire court room from the stand without batting an eye in her
fight for custody of Mary.Her arguments and assessments are hopelessly air-tight and seamless,
leaving Uncle Frank and his lawyer scrambling.Frank just wants Mary to be a little girl. Grandma wants to plug her
into The Matrix. Who will win? 'Gifted' is not without it's displays of some original laughs. My
favorite was a scene in which little Mary discovers her Uncle Frank is
sleeping with her 1st grade teacher, who one morning comes stumbling
into the kitchen wearing only a towel.Their reaction to each other is priceless.As to why this production is flying under the radar with virtually no
advertising or promotion is baffling.The hour-and-a-half flew by for me and left me with an odd feeling it
ended too soon. Aside from that, there was almost nothing wrong with
this film, at least not that I could find.Warm, unique and entertaining, 'Gifted' should stay with you for days
afterwards.A great family night movie.",101,2017
3,6.75,6.4,"I really enjoyed this film. It was imaginative, fun and just thoroughly
entertaining throughout the whole time I was watching it. It had some
actually genuine heartwarming moments that didn't feel manufactured
like some other animated films I've seen in recent past. The animation
was also just gorgeous. I really loved the look of the film, I thought
it had a really nice aesthetic style and felt like a classic piece of
animation that if CGI was around in the seventies, it would've looked
like this. All in all, I personally loved this film. If you want
something that's just plain fun, bizarre and imaginative- with a touch
of warmth- I'd say check this flick out. But if you're looking for
something with more of a concrete plot and a straight forward
narrative, you probably won't find that here.",97,2017
4,11.0,6.4,"The private companies with special tasks in Iraq are since long a
problem. They aren't bound by the rules which regular armed forces
have. They also exist in Britain and this new Ken Loach movie is about
them.A taxi with two children is destroyed. Later one of the contracted
soldiers is killed and his friend tries to find out what happened. Who
are the bad guys here? That warhead in the barrack or somebody or
somebodies much higher in the hierarchy? This is not a typical Ken
Loach drama, since it's on the surface more of a typical war thriller
than an outcry about social injustice. But social injustice becomes the
main theme. Loach is one of the few remaining outraged society
commentators. We shall be glad we have him.",109,2010
5,12.0,5.4,"Forget the Stephen King connection. Their take on aspects of computers
may be a bit off, but it's fiction, let it be fun. And for god's sake,
lay off the special effects.What you end up with is a fantastic film about the possibilities and
dangers of technology in a hypothetical world. You see the hopes and
dreams of a brilliant scientists, and the manipulation of a
militaristic government. You get to see a great example of ""power
corrupting"" a human being.I've seen this film a lot, from 15 to 25 years old, and the last scene
of the movie never fails to give me shivers.But please, please, please don't watch the sequel. Really.",108,1992
6,18.333333333333332,4.5,"Eloise is a movie based on a real world location in Michigan, more
specifically a closed sanitarium that was renowned for it's terrible
medical practices. The movie centers around a son who discovers he has the opportunity to
inherent his Father's estate, which comes along with a hefty amount of
money.But there's a catch, he needs to get his Mother's death certificate.
Everything seems easy enough until he discovers that his Mother's death
certificate was actually moved to a different location and in order to
get it, he would need to file go through a lengthy (and expensive)
legal process. So instead of going through the legal system and getting the paper work
how he should (legally), he decides to break into the now defunct
sanitarium with a friend. I am not a lawyer, but the entire concept that the movie is focused on
seems kind of sketchy, you'd think all of this would have been handled
already. And why would their son need to go to court to get a copy of
his Mother's death certificate? Besides being riddled full of weird plot holes, at first glance the
movie appears to be your generic haunted sanitarium , but it starts to
get really goofy as the film goes on. Frankly, I feel the movie would
have been much better if it had went for the generic spooky ghost film
instead of what they went with.The acting and cinematography are fine for what it is; I have no
complaints. The writing is pretty shaky and the plot of the movie
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. To be honest, I wouldn't even rent this from a RedBox. If it came on
NetFlix or Hulu or something and you got some time to burn (the movie
isn't even 2 hours), then go for it, but I can't recommend spending
actual money to see this film.",89,2017
7,16.6,8.9,"We all know that the ""Phantom of the Opera"" is by far one of the best
known and best loved musicals of the past years. It is quite amazing to
learn that this year is already the 25th year of this acclaimed piece
of musical theater based on the novel by Gaston Leroux. The beautiful
music was by Andrew Lloyd Webber, with most of the lyrics by Charles
Hart, and produced by Cameron Macintosh. It debuted in the West End in
London in 1986. Phantom is recognized as the highest-grossing
entertainment event of all time and the most financially successful
theatrical show in history.Last week, it was suddenly announced that the special 25th Anniversary
performance held at the Royal Albert Hall last October 2-3, 2011 was
actually going to be shown in local theaters! I knew that my wife and I
had to see it again. This morning, I was surprised to learn that this
will be a 3 hour and 41 minute movie. This caused problems in our
schedule but we still decided to push through and watch. An opportunity
to watch a theater event such as this on the big screen was indeed
rare.As we entered, we found out the reason for the very long running time.
Before the show proper, there was first a short documentary about
Phantom by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber. Here we got to hear how the idea of
doing Phantom came about, and meet the original London production crew.
This lasted about 15 minutes. After which there were ads announcing the
sale of DVDs of this event come March next year. I guess we still have
to wait that long to get an original copy of this special. Then there
was about another 5 minute pause (as if waiting for the audience to
fill up) before the show itself actually began. I see that this film
was going to approximate a real theater presentation. Unfortunately,
this also included a real 20 minute Intermission after Act 1. The
theater (we watched in SM Megamall) actually paused the movie for the
whole 20 minutes! So be warned. The Phantom was played by Ramin Karimloo, while his ingénue Christine
Daae was played by Sierra Boggess. I knew these were the same actors
who played these same characters in the short-lived sequel of Phantom
called ""Love Never Dies."" Ms. Boggess was beautiful as Christine
channeling both innocence and sensuousness. Her soprano was flawless
even in the most challenging and punishing notes in ""Think of Me,""
""Phantom of the Opera,"" and ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again."" As
the Phantom, Mr. Karimloo has got that X-factor that makes the role
dangerous yet riveting and sympathetic. His voice can navigate the
highs and lows that makes Mr. Lloyd Webber a musical sadist. It can be
strong, yet tender and also menacing. His ""Music of the Night"" and
""Point of No Return"" were fantastic!The supporting performances were also very strong. Hadley Fraser cuts a
dashing figure as Raoul. His featured duet with Christine, ""All I Ask
of You,"" was very well sung. Kiera Duffy makes a hilarious Madame
Carlotta even as she also hit those unbelievable high notes, in songs
like ""Primadonna."" Liz Robertson makes a very imposing Madame Giry with
her severe black gown always in sharp contrast with the very bright
colors of the costumes around her. Everything was so expertly staged:
the dancing, the costumes, the set pieces, the make-up, the video
backgrounds, were all so rich, elaborate and detailed. The camera work
and direction was also very effective in conveying the drama, danger
and romance of the story.After the last scene where Meg Giry holds up the Phantom's mask after
he vanishes, there was a very long curtain call. The whole stage was
filled with actors and dancers. It was a very emotional moment.
However, after the three main characters made their bows, it was not
yet over. Sir Andrew himself took center stage and thanked the audience
and his crew, present and past. Then he introduced the man who played
the first Phantom, Michael Crawford! Finally he brought out his ""Angel
of Music"", Ms. Sarah Brightman (who was looking very hefty indeed
nowadays). The surprise did not end there, Ms. Brightman obliged to sing! Of
course, she sang ""Phantom of the Opera."" I would not say it was her
best because her breathing was audible, but she could still hit those
killer notes at the end. Another surprise was when it was the Phantom's
turn to sing, four actors who played the Phantom before came out on
stage to sing with Ms. Brightman. Of the four, I recognized two: Colm
Wilkinson (Jean Valjean from Les Miz) and the fantastic Anthony Warlow!
The other guy was John Owen Jones (the current Phantom in London). The
youngest guy of the four Phantoms, Peter Joback (upcoming Phantom in
the 2012 run in London), had a rather thin and nasal pop voice, in
sharp contrast with the booming tenors of the other three. Too bad,
Michael Crawford did not sing a note. After this, the four ex-Phantoms
all took turns to sing ""Music of the Night."" This was another beautiful
rendition of the song. At the end, the present Phantom, Ramin Kaminloo
also joined the group. Another curtain call followed, and the event
comes to an end.This is definitely a must-watch for fans of Phantom, as well as fans of
Musical Theater in general. When time comes for the DVD to come out,
that should also be a must-own in his DVD collection.",137,2011
8,9.0,5.1,"So the new thing for seasoned horror directors is to make their first
non horror film, sometimes with elements of horror, but ultimately a
different genre. Ti west with ""In a valley of violence, Christopher
Smith with ""Detour"", now Eric England with ""Get the girl"", and there
are many more examples I cant think of off the top of my head
immedietely. Eric England's ""Get the girl"" is upbeat, hip, somewhat
exciting, and pretty fast paced. This movie is done by a director who
has only done horror films up to this point and although he is young
Eric England is still seasoned in the genre. Madison County had corny
and ugly characters but was overall a good horror movie. Contracted was
also a good horror movie. It is a body horror film with some good
creepy factors to it. It gives a nice nod to independent horror as it
stars talented screenwriter Simon Barret as the mysterious man,
Caroline Williams as the worried mother, Matt Mercer who England also
used in his first film ""Madison County"" and went on to become a staple
in independent horror. ""Roadside"", England's second to newest film, was
pretty crappy and uneventful. It was a mix of a very boring
thriller/mystery/horror. Now, England comes out with this narrative
engaging thriller, ""Get the girl"". The only problem is tho, that there
are a lot of problems with this film, as it seems as if the director
wanted to upgrade his filming quality and style but he kinda just did
it with out really doing his homework on it. It seems like an amateur
director tried to make a big budget feeling film, but failed kinda
miserably. The lead character is boring and extremely generic. He is
not attractive, he is childish, his intro background story was
seriously lacking any real background info about him which keeps the
audience from ever really feeling for this guy or relating with him and
immedietely makes us think he is shady by not telling us more of his
background. Its like he was hiding something from us and we knew this
within the first 5 or 10 minutes of the movie. The girl is also very
boring and not very attractive at all. The movie is overall confusing
and the only redeeming quality, in my opinion, is the presence of Noah
Segan. He brings a certain menace to any movie he stars in. This movie
seemed childish and immature. It is like a step backwards for Eric
England, as there is no real emotional or mental pull to this film. It
is barely comendable and very forgettable. The biggest problem in this
film is the editing. The film editing sucks. There are several shots
where a character is standing there making a certain face, or even
pointing a gun at someone, and then in the immediate next shot, the
character is suddenly turned around looking out the window. There was
no transfer in actions. It was weird to see the focus of the shot
operating and moving smoothly and accurately, while the background
character was pointing a gun and shifted to walking up the stairs in
the blink of an eye. Terrible editing for an overused and tiring plot.
You would think Eric England had more ""oomph"" in him. I am not
impressed at all. I follow horror directors and their work and I was
excited to hear about this film but once I saw it, I felt embarrassed
for the director. Maybe he will redeem himself with his upcoming four
films lol. I guess the lesson here is don't bite off more than you can
chew and always do your homework. Gave it a 5 cuz its a good teeny
bopper movie for toolish and foolish kids, and cuz i feel a little bad
for England who made a movie to throw up to for all the wrong reasons.",87,2017

watching extremely boring porn, without the actual porn. The acting is
terrible, the script is terrible. Just awful. I guess the high-ish
(much too high for what it is) rating is due to friends of the film
